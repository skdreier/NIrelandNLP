The world in general is experiencing a period of
increasing terrorism when subversives throughout
the
Western and uncommitted countries
prepared to exploit
traditional antagonisms. At the least, therefore training
and propaganda support is likely to be available to the IRA
from outside sources, to help them restart and then maintain violence as a
political weapon whenever the situation is favourable.
(3) It is clear that tension, occasionally erupting as
incidents, is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
b.

RC Community.

No matter how marked or general may be the RC

community's rejection of IRA violence, there is likely to remain an
element within that community which is implacably and historically
opposed to the British connection and accustomed to violence as a means
of demonstrating its conviction.

This element could numerically be

strengthened if former detainees wore released under the Emergency
Provisions Bill review procedure.

There is little prospect of change

in the IRA's long term aim to reunify Ireland by any means including

force, except when a ceasefire appears at the time to be more expedient.
Should the Republicans' voice in the new Assembly prove to be muted or

non-existent, there is a distinct danger that the IRA may consider starting
up a new phase of increased violence as its only recourse.

c.

Protestant Community.

Protestant opinion is divided on the proposals

of the White Paper as they now stand, but much will depend on the way the
political situation develops in the month

ahead.

A substantial proportion

of the community seems to be in favour of giving the White raper a chance
to work.

Of the proportion which opposes it, there is an element which is

prepared to use violence, whose members have equipped themselves with
weapons and have demonstrated a capability in the recent past for terrorism
and for inciting violence as a means of exerting pressure.

It is this

element which can be expected, in response to IRA terrorism or any fears
of a ""sell out"" to present a threat to law and order in the foreseeable
future.

LEGAL POSITION OF SOLDIERS AT POLLING
ACTION AGAINST PICKETING AND INTIMIDATIONSTATIONS, AT POLICY AND
Action in polling Stations
1.

The law for theNIAE provides that soldiers may:
a.

Enter a polling station.

b.
Remove from a polling station, by order of the presiding
officer, a person who misconducts himself in the polling station
or fails to obey the lawful orders of the presiding officer.
2.
Soldiers are to enter a polling station only if the police are
unable to carry out, or unable to carry out unaided, their duties at the
polling station.

3.

The maintenance of order in a polling station is primarily the
responsibility of the presiding officer, supported by the RUC.

4.
Where soldiers enter a polling station in support of the RUC,
they may:
a.

Arrest a person committing a breach of the peace or another

serious offence to which soldiers' normal powers of arresting
persons red-handed apply. Where possible however such arrests

should be made by the RUC.
Remove from the polling station a person other than an
b.
offender under 4a above, who misconducts himself or who fails
to obey the lawful order of the presiding officer, but only if
the presiding officer orders it.
5.

On no account are soldiers to take photographs in polling stations.

6.
If, in exceptional circumstances, soldiers make arrests as in
paragraph 4a. the arrested person is to be handed over to the police as
soon as possible via an RMP arrest team.

Arrest Policy
7.
Reference D applies, except that planned arrest operations are to be
conducted only as specific and local responses in the event of terrorist
outrages. Otherwise persons falling into the categories specified in
paragraph 7 of reference D are to be arrested only if they are seen at

large.

If such persons are seen in the vicinity of polling stations they

are, if circumstances permit, to be arrested after leaving the polling
station rather than before casting their vote.

PICKETING AT POLLING STATIONS

1.
Picketing, although not forecast to be widespread, could be a
serious problem which might cause a presiding officer to close his
polling station. It could take the following forms:
a.

Obstruction of persons entering station.

b.

Verbal persuasion against votersby a line of

pickets.
Pickets noting details of voters with a view to
c.
probably retributive action later.
2.
The proper response to picketing is firstly a matter for the RUC
who should try to dissuade the pickets, move them on or, if necessary,
arrest them.
If the RUC find themselves unable to take sufficient action and
3.
seek Army assistance, troops should take the following action:
a.

Warn the pickets to disperse.

b.

If they refuse to disperse, move them on physically.

c.
Arrest those causing a breach of the peace, using the
common law power of arresting persons committing a breach
of the peace. Millboards should be confiscated and handed to
the RMP arrest team together with those arrested.
Where a breach of the peace is not committed, but the
d.
conduct of the pickets is intimidatory, they should be arrested
only if there is no other way to get them to desist. In these
circumstances the power of arrest to be used is SPA Regulation 11,
in accordance with the Blue Card. The words to be used are:
""I suspect you of being about to commit (or of committing) acts
prejudicial to the peace"".
e.

Soldiers are not to photograph pickets or voters.

f.
Comds are to be given discretion not to take action against
pickets if this is likely to provoke reaction out of proportion
to the offence.

7.

Patrolling.

With the general exception of major roads and interfaces

all military patrol activity is to be reduced as much as possible consistent

with 3(d) above. In the sensitive areas, combined RMP/RUC patrols are to be
instituted wherever possible so as to keep open main routes (in Belfast these
are marked white on the revised communities Map).
8.
Protection of the Interface. These are to be controlled by the
Security Forces to prevent sectarian violence.

9.

Arrest Policy.
(a)

Arrest policy during the period of a ceasefire should be

As regards offences of all kinds committed after the ceasefire,
arrests will be made as necessary within the ambit of the normal
criminal law - i.e. persona will not be arrested for the purpose
of questioning, detention or internment under the Special Powers
Act.

Legal advice is being obtained on the powers of the Army

to arrest.
(b)

The problem of outstanding offences of a terrorist character
committed by IRA men who have evaded arrest or skipped bail will

require a separate decision.
(c)

A further question which will have to be decided at once is whether
any regulations creating criminal offences under the Special Powers
Act should besuspended or repealed.

Searches of buildings and property are to be confined to those in pursuit
of investigation of criminal activities committed after the ceasefire.
VCPs will,
subject to paragraph 3(d), be progressively withdrawn except at entrances to
military bases and at key points and other patented premises.

10.

11.
Altering the Military posture. Other measures that can be taken, as
circumstances allow, to progressively demonstrate a change in military posture
are:
(a)

Vehicle patrols to use Landrovers instead of Pigs as soon as it
is judged safe to do so.

(b)

Weaponsare to be available but not ""at the ready"" whenon
vehicle patrol.

(c)
(d)

Flack jackets and helmets where appropriate are to be readily
available but not worn.

D J Trevelyan Esq
Northern Ireland Office

In your letter to Jack Howard-Drake of 9 June, about
""Arrest Policy"", you touched upon problems that might arise
following a truce.
We have already discussed this aspect
briefly and, without wishing to confuse the present debate
on ""Arrest Policy"", I think it worthwhile trying to clear
our minds now on the further problems that might arise
upon a truce.
2.
If I understand the position correctly, it is generally
held that, were the IRA to call a truce, it would be politically
dangerous to ""lift"" known IRA leaders as their safe havens
became open to normal police and Army activity.
So there would,
in effect, be an amnesty for those IRA men who had managed to
evade capture until the date of the truce and who, if they had
been captured, could only have been detained or interned under
the Special Powers Act, since there was insufficient evidence
against them to bring a criminal charge.
3.
But there are two further categories of IRA men.
First,
those against whom there is sufficient evidence to bring a
charge, but against whom no warrant has yet been issued.
Presumably it is possible to arrange that such men are not
charged.
The second category is more difficult;
there
must be many IRA men,often now taking refuge in the Republic,
against whom warrants have been issued.
If these warrants
were to be withdrawn you would presumably bring down upon
your head immediate calls for the ""amnesty"" to be extended to
all those ""political prisoners"" who were unlucky enough to be
caught and convicted on similar charges before the truce.
No doubt you will hear that call anyway with increasing
stridency in coming months;
what I am now concerned with,
however, is that we should not incur charges of bad faith,
with all the attendant political problems, if we continue to
arrest certain offenders even after the truce.
This problem
has, of course, a wider application than the particular FCO
interest, but it was nonetheless a point that was put to me
in Dublin recently, and I suspect the Irish Government is every
bit as anxious as we are to maintain Mr Whitelaw's good name
for straight dealing in any immediate post-truce period.
4.

It therefore occurred to me that (at the time of any truce)
it might be desirable for a public announcement to be made that
warrants have been issued and will still be executed against

Arrest Policy: Protestants
Two important decisions have been taken here at Stormont Castle in the
last two days.
At the morning meeting on 2 January the Secretary of State expressed
2.
anxiety to take some visible effective action to deal with theassassinations.
The Chief Constable suggested that if it happened that Protestant extremists
suspected of murder or other terrorist crime had to be let go after interrogation by the CID they should be re-arrested under Regulation 11 and interrogated
by the Special Branch. The Secretary of State agreed that this should happen
and said that if the Special Branch interrogation pointed to the preparation
of submissions for interim custody orders he would be quite prepared for this.
In principle there is nothing new in this, since the Secretary of State has
always said that he would be prepared to detain some Protestant extremists if
a proper case were made out. The new element is that some orders for the
custody of Protestants are likely now soon to be made.
The Secretary of State evidently regarded this decision as a first step
3.
and as not in itself constituting any formal change of arrest policy, since
against
any interim custody orders would be incidental to action taken
to
another
step
this
preferred
He
terrorists.
and
murderers
suspected
suggestion, made by the GOC, that the RUC should re-examine, with a view to
the making of custody orders, the list of the 50 or so men apprehended and
released at the drinking club in the Shankill on the famous night when
Gusty Spence, along with the greater part of the command structure of the
UVF, was alleged to have slipped throughthe fingers of the security forces.
4.

The Secretary of State said that he would also look again at the five

specimen cases recently submitted to him of Protestant extremists who might
be made the subject of interim custody orders. What he had in mind was that
if it were possible to put two or three bad men inside as a result of
investigations into their being suspected of murder or other terrorist crime
he might at the same time make orders on another two or three Protestant
extremists on the basis of information about their activities not necessarily
related to specific criminal incidents. These latter two or three might be
from the five specimen cases. He has since looked at these specimen cases
and decided that there would be good grounds for making custody orders in at
least two cases. (It does not follow that orders will in fact be made.)

5.

The second decision was taken at the morning meeting on 3 January, when

arrest policy was formally considered on the basis of Army papers 113G of

""Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence
assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, end for
whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a
criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody

These words are to be inserted as a new paragraph (e), so that the arrest
instructions will now read from (a) to (f) as in the annex to this letter.
6.
This annex reproduces the relevant part of Annex B to HQNI document
1104G of 7 December 1972, which is the Commander Land Forces' Directive for
Future Operations. This is an important document, which we should obtain
for our files, if we have not got it already. (I had not myself previously
seen it.) The arrest instructions as embodied in Annex B to document 1104G,
ie even before this latest amendment, are I think slightly different from
the latest version known to us in the NIO in London; paragraph (b) has an
extra sentence. The purpose of the new paragraph (e) is to make it possible
to proceed against Protestant terrorists. There is, of course, no intention
of announcing that there is a new arrest policy or an arrest policy in relation
to Protestants. Indeed the Chief Constable was most anxious that only a very
limited distribution should be given to the new instruction. He will himself
inform only a very small number of people in the RUC and the GOC said that the

the words ""on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment"". This means that
the security forces will only proceed under this paragraph against named
terrorists and with the approval of the Secretary of State or one of the other
Ministers. It was stated quite unequivocally at the meeting that it is
intended to proceed under this paragraph only with the approval of a Minister
in each case.
I do m t know how much of the foregoing will be reflected

SECURITY REVIEW

The GOC and Chief Constable reported a generally quiet 24-hour period.
The Secretary of State agreed to the establishment of a joint RMP/RUC Task Force
in Londonderry on the lines of that already operating in Belfast.
To counter allegations of lack of activity on the part of the security forces in
relation to recent murders in Belfast it was decided that the Information
Service might release news about the establishment of a separate control room for
the Task Force in Belfast.
Arising out of a discussion about the interpretation of the word ""illegal"", Lord
Windlesham asked Mr Harris and Mr Macmahon to co-operate in producing a short brief
on the application of the term

2.

to organisations and their uniforms.

ARREST POLICY (Resumed Discussion)

The meeting had before it HQNI Paper 1113G of 12 December, para 7(e) of which would
have been modified by the decision taken at the Secretary of State's meeting of
13 December (SSM (72) 118 Item 2).
The GOC said that subsequent discussions between his HQ and NIO Belfast had revealed

that the proposed modification would have introduced unforeseen difficulties.

After

further discussion it was agreed that the sub-paragraph should read as follows:""Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence
assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for
whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal
charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order.""
The meeting noted that the Army Paper was intended for limited distribution and took
the view that no suggestion

should be made in any quarter of any fundamental change

being made in arrest policy.

It was agreed at the Secretary of State's morning meeting on Wednesday
13th December that I should discuss further with the Army the exact wording
of paragraphs 7(b) and 7(e) in the attached document.
2.

On sneaking to the Chief of Staff I was surprised to find that there was

still uncertainty in the Army about whether they wanted the new paragraph 7(e),

as amended at the Secretary of State's meeting, to be circulated now or to be
held in reserve.

They have discussed this among themselves and at the request

of the RUC have come up with the slightly odd idea that the paragraph should
not be circulated until, as they put it, ""the dossiers are available"".

I do

not understand what the relevance is of this but for the moment have merely
agreed with the Chief of Staff that we will talk again about it when the
dossiers are in fact available.

The subject will no doubt come up when the

""test case"" is considered next week.

The Army would prefer to make a

further amendment to the amendment which

you proposed at the meeting and they now wish paragraph 7(e) to read as follows:

I see no objection to this.

5.

I discussed further with the Chief of Staff the second sentence of

paragraph 7(b).

He explained that it had been included in the revised CLF

directive on the grounds it reflected the instructions in the Secretary of
State's letter of 6th November in which he said: ""In view of recent
developments, Protestant terrorists may fall to be dealt with under the new
order.

ARREST POLICY
(Paper by GOC)

INTRODUCTION
1.
This instruction is written in an effort to summarise the many letters
and signals put out over the months on arrests,and to show how the soldier
can use his powers of arrests in Northern Ireland in simple terms. A full
instruction on this subject will shortly be promulgated and the present
instruction provides guidance in the meantime on the main points.
2.
A soldier has the general
under statute and common law.
Powers) Act (Northern Ireland)
or SPA) confers further powers

powers of arrest enjoyed by every citizen
In addition the Civil Authorities (Special
1922 (referred to as the Special Powers Act
of arrest on soldiers on duty.

TYPES OF ARREST
Red Handed Arrests

3.

These are normally made under the general ""citizen"" powers where a

soldier sees a person commit, or suspects on reasonable grounds that a
person has just committed a breach of the peace or serious offence, e.g.
assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon.
The soldier must tell the person in question why he is arresting him in the
simplest possible terms, but he must include the word ""arrest"".
Example 'A'. When a stone thrower is snatched, the arresting
soldier could say ""You're under arrest for riotous behavious""
or more simply ""You're under arrest for throwing stones"".
Example 'B'. Where a person is searched and a weapon is found
upon him the words could be ""I am arresting you for the unlawful
possession of a firearm"".

Planned Arrests
4.
These are normally made under the SPA powers. The degree of planning
can vary between maydays and a few minutes but it is most important that
the formula on the Blue Card is used in every case; and it is as well to
nominate the soldier who is to carry out the actual arrest and if possible
to practise what he is to say beforehand. There is no reason why he should
not read the arrest formula from his Blue Card whilst making the arrest.

5.

The two Regulations from the SPA which are used for planned arrests

are:Regulation 10

-

for interrogation

Regulation 11

-

on suspicion

6.
Regulation 10. For the time being this Regulation is NOT to be used.
When in use it applies only to the situation in which the RUC wish to
interrogate a person and are using troops as their agents to effect the
arrest. The authorisation to carry out the arrest must come from an officer
of the RUC of the rank of Superintendent or above and should be in writing.
The formula at paragraph 4 of the Blue Card must be used.

Regulation 11. This is chiefly used when a person is suspected of
having committed anoffence in the field of law and order but there is a
brook in time between the alleged commission of the offence and the apprehension of the suspect. The appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue
Card must be used. Additionally persons in the following categories are to
be arrested under Regulation 11 powers:a.
Anyone against hom there is known to be evidence to
justify the preferring of criminal charges.
b.
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which
might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal
charges. If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested
person cannot be charged
consideration will be given to
a possible application for an interim custody order, where
the grounds appear to be sufficient
c.
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional
IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges.
d.
Provisional IRA Volunteers, who, on the strength of reliable
intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to
security.
Other terrorists
who are known, on the strength of reliable
intelligence, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security,
and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the
basis of a criminal charge,
strong case could be made for an
Interim Custody Order.
e.

f.
Anyone in the company of a person arrested ""red-handed""
(see paragraph 3 above) if the arresting soldier suspects him
of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial
to peace.
8.
Soldiers may wish to question a passer-by, e.g. as to his identity
and recent activities, even though his behaviour gives no grounds for
suspicion. This is permissible if it is done on the spot or very close
by and the questions are reasonable. There is no power to require a
person to leave the immediate area and go to a military post for this
questioning unless he is lawfully arrested. If an answer is given which
causes the soldier to suspect the person of falling into one of the
categories in paragraph 7 above, he should arrest him under Regulation
11 of the SPA, remembering to use the appropriate formula from paragraph
6 of the Blue Card. If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion
to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately. If
however the passer-by refuses to stop or to answer the questions he is
committing an offence against the SPA Regulations and the soldier can
arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA on that ground.

FOR PROTESTANTS

Reference:-

A.

1113 G dated 9th December 1972.

1.

At the meeting at Stormont Castle on 11th December, the GOC tabled

a paper on Arrest Policy for Protestants, proposing a form of words to
be incorporated in the Army's arrest instructions in the event of a
decision to widen the arrest policy in respect of Protestant terrorists.
Discussion was adjurned so that a further paper could be prepared showing
where the additional form of words would fit into the existing arrest
instructions.

2.

Attached is the relevant extract from the arrest instructions,
corresponding to pages 1 - 2 of Annex B to CLF's Directive 1104 G dated
7th December (of which the Northern Ireland Office has copies), but with
an additional arrest category inserted as a new sub-paragraph 7 e. (sidelined).
This sub-paragraph is not included in the current Directive.

The words in

square brackets would be included or not, depending upon whether it was
desirable at the time to single out specific categories of terrorists, for
example by naming certain organisations but not others.

ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS
(PAPER BY COC)
The Army's present arrest instructionsprovide that soldiers
1.
are to arrest, in addition to persons caught red-handed in the act
of committing an offence, persons in the following categories:a.
Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence
to justify the preferring of criminal charges.
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence
b.
which might, after questioning, justify the preferring
of criminal charges.
c.
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the
Provisional IRA even though there is no evidence to
justify criminal charges.
d.
Provisional IRA volunteers who, on the strength of
reliable intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally
serious threat to security.
Anyone in the company of a person arrested ""rede.
handed"" if th arresting soldier suspects him of having
committed or being about to commit an act prejudical to
peace.
From this it will be seen that arrests are linked to the
2.
prospect of bringing criminal charges, except in the case of
categories c. and d. - ie. Provisional officers and certain
volunteers.
The policy does not therefore provide for the arrest of
3.
Protestants or other non-Provisional terrorists except with
the object of bringing a criminal charge. Protestants are not,
as the policy stands, arrested with a view to their being made
subject to Interim Custody Orders (ICOs) and brought before the

Commissioners.
individual cases he will be prepared to consider on their merits
applications for Interim Custody Orders in respect of Protestants,
but such applications for Protestants will only arise where a
person who at the time of arrest is thought to be criminally
chargeable turns out during questioning not to be chargeable.
Ministers have judged that the time is not at themoment
4.
ripe for an extension of the arrest policy in respect of Protestants.
The object of this note is however to suggest a form of words
which can be incorporated in the Arrest Policy Instructions when
the time comes for such an extension.

5.

It is very difficult to lay down precise criteria to define
those Protestant terrorists who should be arrested.
With the
exception of the UVF, Protestant extremist organisations are not
in themselves illegal; it is not therefore possible to regard all
those holding certain defined positions in Protestant organisations

suggested, therefore, that a category defined along
should be added to the categories of persons
the following li

6.

It is

to be arrested:-

""Other terrorists (as specified from time to time by the
Secretary of State) who areknown, on the strength of
reliable intelligence to be an exceptionally serious
threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of
evidence which couldform the basis of a criminal charge,
a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order.""
Minor amendments to categories e and d would be required
if, as the result of an end to the Official IRA's ceasefire,
Official IRA members were once again arrested with a view to
detention.

7.

It could be argued that the UVF, which like the IRA is an
8.
illegal organisation, should be singled out for special treatment.
To possibilities are:To provide that all members of the UVF are to
a.
be arrested.
To provide that persons holding officer positions
b.
in the UVF are to be arrested.
The present arrest policy does not provide for the arrest
of all members of the Provisional IRA, and it would be illogical
to go further in the case of the UVF than we do in the case of
the IRA. The arrest of officers in the UVF is a more realistic
option; but it is doubtful whether the intelligence available in

9.

their cases is sufficient to support applications for Interim
Custody Orders, or subsequent Detention Orders by the Commissioners,
except of course where a UVF officer falls anyway within the
category defined in paragraph 8 above.
10. The arrest instructions will, in any case, require overhaul
when the awaited improvements are introduced to the law on
membership of illegal organisations in order to remove the present

to ""criminal offences"" in the present arrest instructions have not
been taken to include membership of an illegal organisation; otherwise the Army would be bound to arrest all members of the IRA
(Official as well as Provisional), UVF, etc. Even if the law is
amended effectively, there
ill be strong reasons on practical
as well as political grounds for not arresting everyone who commits

the offence of membership of an illegal organisations;
members of the Official IRA will be excluded.

Ped-handed arrests

7. A soldier, like any other citie , has the pewer under c mon ai
statute law to arrest any person who is in the act of comiitting or ha3
just ccomitted in his presence a breach of thepeae or serious rimin,.l
offence (eg riotous behaviour, theft, substantial damage to property,
serious assault, possessin of an offensive weapon, possession or
preparation of explosivea).
This power of arrest applies essentially
to the arrest of wrong-doers red- handed.
For instance if a street-fi3r,
is taking place a soldier may use his citizon's posors to rrest
a per.on
whom he sees taking part in the brawl. Sit
rly a soldier may use his
citizen's powers to arrest a person wha he finds in t
fiul posses.c.a of

As at

inter alia the extent to which the individual concerned is

currently actively engaged in terrorist activity and the
possibility of criminal charges being preferred. The practice
whereby special Branch officers are available to explain the background of each case should continue, and it may be helpful on
occasion if an Ary representative is also available to discuss the

be sent to Headquarters NorthernIreland.
You will know that it is myintention to seek the agreement of my

members of the IRA whose continued liberty is a threat to security.
The arrangements which I describe above are therefore on interim

I attended a meeting on 25th July at which the Attorney General
with representatives of the Army, the RUC and others proposals which the Army
have been putting forward for strengthening certain of their powers under the
Special Powers Act and in particular for clarifying their powers of arrest and
interrogation.
2.

The discussion was confined to the latter and was not related to any

particular scale of operations.

We did not get on to the other questions of

which we had had advance notice,

such as curfews and stopping individuals and

vehicles crossing the border; nor was there any discussion of indemnity.
3.

It was disturbing to discover that even at this stage there is a good

deal of confusion about the Army's powers of arrest and interrogation and
there still seems to be a large differing of legal views on the subject.

The

meeting eventually agreed that revised draft regulations - not incorporating
any substantial changes position.

should be prepared in an attempt to clarify the

The Army and the RUC are to produce a draft which can be looked at

from both the legal and political angles.
4.

In the course of a lengthy discussion it emerged that the Army must make

a large proportion of their arrests under Regulation 11

(detention) rather

than under Regulation 10 under which a man can be held for interrogation for
48 hours.
5.

Up to now it has been understood that a man arrested under Regulation 11

could be held legally for only 24 hours before being charged,
having a detention order made against him.

A legal judgement made some little

time ago has called this into question and the Attorney General considered
that there was/no legal limit on the time which a man could be held under
Regulation 11 before he was charged, released or detained.

He also took the

view that a man so held could be questioned - a point which has apparently been
in doubt.

The meeting which the Attorney General held on 25th July to
consider proposals by the Army for extending their powers under
the Special Powers Act turned out to be little more than a mainly
legal discussion of their existing powers of arrest and interrogaA particular point emerged on which instructions are

required.
2.

The broad pattern of arrest and questioning in the past has

been for suspects to be arrested under Regulation 10 and
interrogated for 48 hours.

Some have then been re-arrested under

Regulation 11 and it has been understood that they then had to be
charged, released or

within 24 hours of being so arrested.

The legal view now being taken is that there is no limit on the
period

under

underwhich a man can be held

Regulation 11 without a detention order but There are obvious
political objections to making th
3.

period very long.

A substantial proportion of the arrests made by the Army

in future operations will be under Regulation 11.

This means that

unless there is some extension of the limited period previously
thought to be available for questioning under Regulation 11

interrogation will be restricted to 24 hours.

Any extension can

be made by administrative decision.
4.

The Army and the RUC are pressing for the period in some

cases to be extended to five day

Questioning

under the Judges Rules.

Although the Attorney

General made it abundantly clear that questioning must nevertheless
be lawful,interrogation ora period of five days would give rise

",4  the army and the ruc are pressing for the period in some  cases to be extended to five days  questioning would not  necessarily be under the judges rules  although the attorney  general made it abundantly clear that questioning must nevertheless be lawful interrogation over a period of five days would give rise to a good deal of suspicion and to many allegations of brutality particularly as suspects will be held incommunicado  but a period of three days would be no longer  than the period for which men have been held in the past under a combination of regulation 10 and regulation 11  it is suggested  therefore that you should agree that suspects arrested under regulation 11 may now be held for questioning for up to 72 hours before being charged released or made the subject of a detention order  where arrests are made under regulation 10 in  the first  instance the total period should still not exceed 72 hours  5  the attorney general would support this proposal  william nield 26 july 1972

Wanted List
It is interesting to note that category III of the wanted list, which
is defined by the RUC as:

""Those holding key positions in terrorist

organisations who are known to be responsible for the direction and
performance of acts of violence by others, but against whom there is no
evidence or intelligence of personal involvement"" contains only 31 names.
The Secretary of State's warnings about the difficulties of further
large scale internment and detention have clearly been taken to heart and
as a result the list seems to have been carefully sifted to include only
key figures.

The list contains 11 Official IRA and presumably their

inclusion will have to be reviewed if that organisation decides to
continue its ceasefire.
Category III contains no Protestant extremists.

631,IMG_1871_CJ_4_458,"Mr Jack

We spoke about the attached documents and, in particular, the
Army's interpretation of our instructions on arrest policy set out
in their letter of 28 June which Sir William Nield asked me to look
at.
There are two points which worry me.
(a)

These are:

Paragraph (b) of the Army letter envisages that persons may be
arrested under Regulation 10 ""for purposes of questioning prior
I am uncertain whether an
to preferment of criminal charges"".
arrest for such purposes would properly be within the powers
conferred by Regulation 10. When we redrafted the main policy
document, our main object was to preserve the powers of arrest
under Regulation 11(1); these powers contemplate that persons
so arrested could, in certain circumstances, be brought before

the courts and the powers of arrest relate to any person whom
the arresting officer ""suspects of acting or of having acted
or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation
of the peace or the maintenace of order"" and so on. To my mind,
there is no doubt that the Army could arrest a person under
these powers for the purpose of bringing that person before
I am less sure about Regulation 10 where the arrest
the courts.
must specifically be for ""interrogation"". Further, the Lord
Chief Justice has made i clear that the courts are unlikely to
regard as admissable in criminal proceedings statements made by
persons arrested and interrogated under Regulation 10. I do not
know what is said in the Blue Card but I wonder whether it would
not be better to miss out (b) altogether since the Army will
have more than enough powers of arrest under Regulation 11 and
no question of proceedings for wrongful arrest could arise in
the exercise of those powers if the person was subsequently
If, however, for presentational
brought before the courts.
reasons,the Army wish to keep a reference to Regulation 10, it
would be better to refer to it in paragraph (c); but the words
used by the arresting officer should nevertheless refer to

Regulation 10 and 11.
(b)

I am not altogether happy about the wording of paragraph (c)
in the Army letter. It says that arrests are to be made ""in
respect of conduct and not simply membership of an illegal
organisation"".
The reference to ""conduct"" is, in my view,
quite correct since the arrest power is attached to various
types of prejudicial behaviour. The reference to ""membership

of an illegal organisation"" is, however, unhappy since strictly
no such arrest should properly be made under Regulation 11.
The object of the wording is possibly to refer obliquely to
Regulation 24(A) - but this regulation is, as I understand it,
much observed in the breach as a result of rather perverse
decision of the courts recently that membership of the Provisional
wing did not constitute membership of the IRA. If the letter of

28 June is to be redrafted, I think it better to omit the words
""and not simply membership of an illegal organisation"".

ARREST POLICY

1.

The Special Powers Act, and Regulations made under it, has not
been repealed, but the post-ceasefire situation demands that the

powers of arrest under Regulation 10 and 11 are not used.
Statute
and Common Law, however, empower the soldier (like any other
citizen) to arrest a person he sees committing, or whom he suspects

on reasonable grounds to have committed, a breach of the peace or

a serious offence such as serious assault, malicious damage, theft,
or possession of an offensive weapon. Mere suspicion is not enough.
These powers are commonly used by soldiers at present without
recourse to Regulations under the Special Powers Act and are contained
in Annex B to Part 3 Section 3 of NISSIs 1971.
Their use should
continue.
The arrest procedures specified in the Blue Card are not therefore to be used until further notice.

2.

3.
Arrests are to be made in response to the actual commission
of criminal offences only.
They are not to be made for the purpose

of interrogation, detention or internment or on mere suspicion.
4.

Arrests are, wherever possible, to be made by members of the

RUC.
If, in an exceptional case, it is not possible for a member
of the RUC to carry out an arrest, soldiers may do so as long as
the Common and Statue Law powers of arrest apply. These powers
apply essentially to the apprehension of a wrong-doer red-handed.

5.

An arrested person is to be taken to the nearest RUC station

but not to a PHC.

6.

The policy described in this Annex relates only to Regulations

10 -

12 under the Special Powers Act and does not affect other

powers under the Special Powers Regulations, for example those of
search.

654,IMG_1894_CJ_4_458,"ARRESTS

1.
The SPA and Regulations made under it will continue to be in operation
but the new scope of operations means that these powers will be used sparingly.
2.

Arrests will wherever possible be made by members of the RUC.

3.
Arrests will not be made for the purpose of questioning, interrogation
or internment under the SPA. Arrests will not be made under Regulation 10
of the SPA (which provides for arrests on the authority of a member of the
RUC for the purpose of interrogation).
4.

Arrests will be carried out only for criminal offences.

Statute and

common law empower the soldier (like any other citizen) to arrest a person
who is committing a breach of the peace or a serious offence such as serious
assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon.

These

powers are commonly used by soldiers at present, without recourse to the SPA.
5.

If, in an exceptional case, it is not possible for a member of the RUC

to carry out an arrest, the soldier may still use Regulation 11 under the
SPA if a criminal offence has been committed but there is doubt whether

common and statute law powers of arrest apply.

These powers apply essentially

to the apprehension of a wrongdoer red-handed, whereas the powers under
Regulation 11 entitle a soldier to arrest on suspicion.

Thank you for your letter of 9 June about the ""wanted"" list and the arrest
and prosecution of IRA leaders from the South.

These

were discussed at JSC(0) last week, and no doubt you

will have seen the minutes; paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 refer.

(The particular arrests

on 5 June had been discussed the week before, when we drew the Army's attention
to the embarrassment which could be caused by their emphasising the standing of
IRA figures whom they arrested.)

Both the Army and the RUC took the view that

their instructions to personnel should ensure that only the more important
terrorists, or those who were likely to be charged, were arrested; they also
considered, however, that it was right to maintain a full list of suspects, not
as ""wanted""

people but in case the information should be required at any time or

in any particular area.

The Committee accepted that this was reasonable, and I do not think that
we can press the point any further for the time being.

As to the arrest of IRA leaders from the Republic, we did pass your message
of 2 June to the Chief Constable the same day.

But at JSC(O) the RUC

representatives took the view that there was very little prospect of gathering
evidence against these men which would be likely to satisfy the courts, and as

you say the use of Regulation 10 and 11 in these cases presents obvious
difficulties.

In fact, no ""notables"" appeared, but on Monday,

This was discussed at Neil Cairncross' meeting on Tuesday

The feeling here was that the Army should know precisely the

684,IMG_1924_CJ_4_458,"BACKGROUND NOTE ON THE ASSOCIATION MR LEGAL JUSTICE
FORMATION AND AIMS

The ALJ was formed in February 1971. The People's Democracy were active in its
creation along with NICRA and both factions of the IRA.

Its originAl aims were

to secure the release of all ""political prisoners"", to protect the rights of such
prisoners pending their release and to prevent the introduction of internment.
Once internment was introduced its abolition became the ALJ's prime aim in cooperation with all opposition groups in Northern Ireland.
The ALJ defines a ""political prisoner"" as anyone in prison for an offence arising
out of political causes in Northern Ireland.
OPERATION

It is, of course, Republican oriented.

Though the name of the organisation is

ambiguous, the ALJ is not in any sense a legal body but a propaganda group.

The

ALJ forms what might be termed an unofficial complaints bureau whereby anyone
having a complaint, real or imagined, can-get in touch with willing solicitors
who will take down a deposition which has every appearance of a legal document.
This is then publicised, rather than being sent as a serious complaint to the RUC
or other authority.

ALJ also buys advertising space to publicise the allegations,

and they have consolidated allegations of certain subjects and put them out in
booklet form.

It is interesting to note that this technique is justified by ALJ on the grounds that
no one can expect justice from the courts here, yet cases when the courts have found
against members of the security forces for assault

Attempts by the authorities to

get to the truth have almost invariably been frustrated by the tactic of refusal to
co-operate by the complainant, and the obstructive attitude of some solicitors.
So far as is known there is no official ALJ publication and it does not have an
""executive role"" ie it does not get involved with the Bar Council or any other
legal organisations.

The ALJ's prime aim is to seek publicity and they have been largely responsible
for the publication throughout the world of anti-internment literature and
allegations of brutality by the security forces.

Particular targets are the RUC,

Special Branch and the Army (particularly the Royal Military Police,

Royal Army

Medical Corps and, on a couple of occasions, The Parachute Regiment).

These activities are not only carried out by the ALJ as an organisation, but also
by individual members, eg Fr Faul of St Patrick's Academy, Armagh.

Fundamentally the ALJ provides the IRA with a platform for spreading lies.

It is

a fact that IRA men have standing instructions that, after being in the hands of
the security forces,

they should make allegations of brutality.

As a result of this,

a defendant has now only to say his statement was taken under duress to enjoy a very

good chance of having it disallowed - an example of the effectiveness of propaganda.
It is not known how the ALJ is financed.
The ALJ works very closely with the Campaign for Social Justice, which was the

22. There is of course a danger that, if the techniques are applied to an
undue degree, the detainee will, either consciously or unconsciously,
give
false information. So far as the operations in Northern Ireland arecon-

25. We have thought it right to consider whether it is possible to obtain
valuable information of this kind byo ther means. There is no doubt that in
time of war skilled interrogators can obtain and have obtained valuable
information by other means by guile, by careful groupingo f prisoners and
monitoring of conversations with the aid of microphones. and by the introduction of "" stool pigeons "". Circumstances in time of war are. however, very
different. Large resources are generally available in the form both of skilled
interrogators and guands and ample accommodation ; certainly as time goes
on, if not at the beg Ming. ample information is available to assist interrogators ; there is no need or wish to keep the prisoner'si identty secret ;and
there are often, as in the last War, a number of prisoners who dislike the
current enemy regime and are only too willing to talk. Moreover, it is doubtful whether today, when "" bugging "" is a well-known and unfortunately often
used technique, its use would produce any information.
26. Considerable and persuasive evidence has been put before us that in
counter-revolutionary operations. andin p articular in urban guerilla warfare.
interrogation as conducted in conditions f war is not very effective. While
highly skilled interrogators might succeed in getting valuable information
over a substantial period of time, they would be unlikely to obtain it as
quickly. This evidence we accept.

Should these techniques be employed?
27. We do not subscribe to the principle that the end justifies the means.
The means, in our view, must be such as not only comply with the Directive,
but are morally acceptable taking account of the conditions prevailing.
28. It is at this point that we encounter divergencies of view in what is a
highly emotive field. Some take the view that any attempt to disorientate the
mind, to lessen the will so as to make a man more susceptible to oral
interrogation is, if not mental torture, at any rate not humane, and that the
techniques in any form are humiliating or degrading. Others claim that the

techniques produce no more than hardship and discomfort for a short period.
29. The true view, it seems to us, must depend upon the degree to which
the techniques are applied. It is one thing, for instance, to keep a detainee
at the wall, hooded and subjected to noise, for x hours before oral interrogation, and thereafter to return him to a cell unhooded and not Subjected
to

noise.It is another to keep him under these conditions at the wall for

2x
hours and to return him to the wall after interrogation
again hooded and
subjected to noise. It must also depend on the length of time
during which
he is deprived of sleep or given a restricted diet. And all these
matters depend

upon the medical condition of the detainee. What would be
intolerable for
a man in poor health might amount to no more than inconvenience
for a fit
man.

30. Whether or not what is done is in conformity with the
in our view to be judged by how a dispassionate observer Directive falls
would view the

The following should be arrested if the opportunity arises:
a)

Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to justify
the preferring of criminal charges.

b)

Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which
might justify the preferring of criminal charges (subject to
further questioning).

c)

Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional IRA
even though there is no evidence to justify criminal proceedings.

d)

Anyone caught in the act of committing or having just committed

a criminal offence.
e)

Anyone caught in the company of someone caught in the act of

committing or having just committed a criminal offence if there

is reason to think he may be able to give information about the
offence or important information about the IRA generally.

But

an arrest under e) by a member of HM Forces acting without the

If a person is arrested under Regulation 10, he may be held in

The detailed questioning of subjects will begin after an initial
assessment of each individual has been completed. This assessment is

teams to exploit their other advantage - that the subject is an

factor being the judgement as to whether the subject has information of

The Object of Interrogation
Under the present arrest policy most people arrested are being questioned with

a view towards criminal charges being brought; but those against whom charges cannot
be brought are being questioned for intelligence purposes according to instructions

already issued (Ref A).

This will continue.

But those who are questioned for

That interrogation will be carried out just as if it had taken

place under existing instructions but the following instructions should also be
observed.

CGS MEETING WITH S OF S NI - PM 3 AUGUST 1972
1.
CGS had an extremely satisfactory meeting with Mr Whitelaw
on the evening of Thursday August 3rd to discuss particularly
interrogation and preventive detention. Mr Cairncross was present
throughout as Sir William Nield is on leave.
2.
Interrogation. CGS showed Mr Whitelaw AUS(GS)'s minute and
the draft directive attached to it; you have copies of both of
these.
Mr Whitelaw said that he would send the paper and directive
to the Prime Minister that evening, without commitment, saying that
he had discussed them with the CGS and proposed to discuss them with
him, the Prime Minister, on 4th August.
He also intends to talk to
S of S over the weekend saying that he accepts the need for extended
interrogation, he accepts that this cannot be done in every Police
Station and that he accepts the need to establish Police Offices in
Castlereagh, to cover Belfast, and Ballykelly, to cover the 8 Brigade
area, purely because there is no suitable Police Station in Londonderry itself.
He is not, however, all that keen to establish a third
Office at Armagh, but has not totally vetoed the idea and if necessary
could be persuaded.
He is, however, desperately concerned about
the inevitable allegations of brutality which will arise but, if

the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State agree with the establishment of these Offices, he will issue the directive to the Chief
Constable without having a further Gen 79 meeting. As far as Gen 79
was concerned the earliest it could really be held was next Thursday,
as Mr Whitelaw himself intended to be in his constituency on Friday.
He said that Lord Balniel should be told that the paper had gone
without commitment to the Prime Minister, and AUS(GS) did this.
3.
Preventive Detention. S of S NI would now put a paper to his
colleagues saying that when Parliament reassembled it should have
before it a paper on the Tribunal/Special Courts issue setting out
the problem. Clearly no legal legislation could be put through in
this session.
In the meantime, however, he was perfectly prepared
to make more extensive use of his powers to detain and would do so
until the issue was discussed in thehouse. At the Gen 79 meeting

towards the end of next week the NIO would produce a preliminary
paper for discussion.
4.
CGS mentioned the difference between Regulation 11 of the
Special Powers Act which allowed holding (and questioning) for an
indefinite period and Regulation 10 which had a statutory 48 hour
time limit; it was this time limit that had been extended to those
held under Regulation 11, by usage rather than by statute.

To obtain successful results from interrogation, the actual and instinctive
resistance of the person concerned to interrogation must be overcome by permissible
techniques.
This will be more easily achieved by sustained interrogation in an
atmosphere of rigid discipline.

It may therefore

be necessary for interrogation

to be carried out continuously for long periods both by day and by night with
consequent disruption of the normal routine of living.

Where practicable, all persons detained in the Interrogation Centre should
any
be seen daily by a Medical Officer and asked if they have any complaints;
allegations of cruelty or torture should be reported at once to the appropriate
superior medical headquarters or senior responsible civil or military authority.
Medical examinations should be mandatory on admission and discharge (including
temporary transfers to or from a detention or other holding centre) and medical
treatment available as required.
The Medical Officer is to maintain a record
of each person's weight as recorded on admission and discharge.

British officer, However, men were placed successfully in most
of the steamship
companies
trading with Dublin, on the railways, as journalists or farmers and even
inthe I.R.A. They made friends with Dublin citizens ofevery class and
both sexes,
they mixed with crowds and they were arrested with officers and men of the I.R.A.
Their knowlodge was extensive and peculiar, but it was doubtful whether owing to the
system of intelligence in Dublin (see pages 18-20), they were ever employed to the
best advantage.
Another branch of the secret service. based on London, is said to have cost about
£15,000 a year. The information which came through this source was always 24 to
48 hours delayed and this militated against its usefulness.

Moreover, owing to the

police office system it was never clear from what source their secret information came
and no adequate arrangements for criticism by the expert branches were ever made.
This of course is a fundamental necessity with secret service.
It is laid down that lower formations should not control secret service. This
in so far as informers wore concerned, had to be done in Ireland because as a rule no
informer would deal with any but a man he knew. Secret service, properly speaking, did
not exist in the country. Many officers believe that, had there been sufficient money
available or had a secret service system been started earlier, considerable results might
have been obtained.

Though it would undoubtedly have been desirable for every

intelligence officer to have had more money available for immediate rewards, etc., it
is open to question whether money would in itself have made secret service possible ;
while had agents been planted five years ago throughout the country they would,
assuming the policy as actually carried out not to have been altered, in all probability
have become ardent Sinn Feiners by 1920.

and they were useless in buildings such as wooden huts where every noise was

prisoners believed they were installed everywhere, and this belief greatly hampered

especially to the branch compiling the-Order of Battle and IrishRepublican Army
list.
(ix) Subordinate Intelligence Officers, and Rank and File and Subordinate
Intelligence Staff-Military intelligence officers in Ireland were young, enthusiastic
and extraordinarily brave and they frequently obtained excellent results by slicer
audacity. Many of them developed marked aptitude for intelligence duties and proved
themselves to be possessed of tact, patience and intuition. Almost without exception
they were very hard workers. They had constantly to tour their areas and went
personally -with most raiding and searching parties, because they alone had the
knowledge which ensured that raids and searches produced the best.results, and they
were in almost constant personal danger, for from the autumn of 1920 onwards, any
officer known to be engaged on intelligence duties ran a certain amount of risk when.

no information of value.

They had, howeve,some of the defects of their virtues. Zeal sometimes outran
discretion and the natural and laudable determination to know their areas made it
difficult for them always to keep their records complete and up-to-date. This was also

907,IMG_2148_DEFE_24_1214,"Sinn Fein Intelligence in Internment Camps.
The system in internment cams was practically confined to counter espionage.
Little is known of it except at Ballykinlar, but then methods adopted in this camp
are probably typical.
The chief fear of the internes'leaders was that secret agents would be used against
them. To prevent this and for general intellignce purposes the following system

was adopted:-

A Chief Intelligence Officer was appointed with four sections under him

(a) Censorship ; (b) Intelligence Officers (called agents) ; (c) Scouts ;

(d) Reference

Department.
(a) Censorship - All letters to and from interns were censored in order :(1) To prevent internes friends or relations or interns themselves giving
information to the Military Staff.
(2). To detect any agents or "" traitors "" in the camp.
In the case of outgoing letters anything considered of use to us was deleted
the letter returned to the writer. Raids were also made on letter boxes to ensure
that no attempts were made to evade this censorship. At first it was caried out
secretly, but as was to be expected its existence was soon discovered and the leaders

then continued it openly. As time-went on however, and, as it was apparently
effective, it was enforced only occasionally or against suspected men.
(b) Intelligence Officers -An Intelligence Officer was selected for each but by
the Chief 1.0. His duty consisted in watching the other men of thehut and reporting
anyone whom he regarded as suspicious. He also made very careful enquiries about
the relations and antecedents of each man. Any doubtful men were shadowed so

that they could not communicate secretly with our intelligence officers.
investigations about suspected

The

en was very thorough and it is said to have taken

seven months to complete, for which reason, it was stated, that no attempts were made
at tunnelling until after this period. Men were warned against talking in such a
way that information could be obtained through the listening sets which, they
believed, were installed in every hut. It was the duty of these I.O.s to lookout for
such conversations and report the delinquents.
Similar intelligence officers were appointed for workshops, hospitals, cookhouses, etc.
(c) Scouts.-The duties of scouts consisted in protecting meetings from surprise
visits. They were used also to watch and report the movements of war intelligence
officers inside and, if possible, outside the camp. These duties were well carried out

and were important when tunnelling was in progress. They made it difficult for our
intelligence officers to move about the camp and to interview people secretly.
(d) Reference Deparment. This consisted of a number of intelligence officers
from different Brigade areas' whose local knowledge was used in connection with
suspects.
In addition to these four sections, electricians were employed to discover
listening sets.

Mr. Faulkner and issued.

Begins.
1.

If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of
economic and soial development, and we must find the means to
,

create a more united society here - one in which all men of
good will, however divergent their legitimato political views
may participate to the full. These things are, and will
continue to be, the aims of our policy.
2.
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now
threaten our economic life and create every day deeper
divisions and antagonism within our community.

These, indeed,

are the clear objects of those who carry them out.

Every means has been tried to make terroristsamenable to

campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to
conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or
quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness.
4.

I have therefore decided,

after weighing all the relevant

considerations, including the views of the security authorities
and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to
exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment
vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs.
5.

Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the

security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this
morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such
of these men as constitute a serious and continuing threat to
public order and safety.
This will be done only after a careful
scrutiny of information furnished to me by the police in respect
of each ouch person, sufficient to convince me that the
individual in question is a threat to present peace and
maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

which will hear

representations for release and make recommendations to me.
6.
I have taken this serious step solely for the protection
of life and security of property in Northern Ireland. At all
times I have consistently emphasised that it was not a step
towards which I would be moved by any political clamour.
Equally, I cannot now allow the prospect of any misrepresentations
to deflect me from my duty to act.
7.

This is not action taken against any responsible and law-

abiding section of the community. Nor is it in any way

least in those areas where violent men have exercised a certain
away by. threat and intimidation over decent and responsible men
and women.
8.
The main target of the present operation in the Irish
Republican Army which has been responsible for recent acts of
terrorism, and whose victims have included Protestant and

Roman Catholic alike. They are the present threat: but we
will not hesitate to take strong action against any other
individuals or organisations who may present such a threat in
the future.
9.

It is with understandable reluctance that one uses these

exceptional powers, but the organisations concerned are those
which have murdered in cold blood, created situations which
have led to death or injury to people quite uninvolved in
disorder, maimed numerous people including young children and
put at risk the jobs and the whole future of entire communities.

I ask those who will quite sincerely consider the use of
internment powers as evil to answer honestly this question:

Is it more of an evil than to allow the perpetrators of these
outrages to remain at liberty? I cannot guarantee that the
action we have now taken will bring this campaign swiftly to an
end. We may yet have much to endure as a community: but if we

11 and 12

Thank you for your letter about the above and if any

further queries arise out of this letter I will be pleaed

concerned.
2.

Regulation 10

Regulation 10 enables an officer of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary to authorise the arrest without warrant and
detention for a period of not more than 48 hours for the
purpose of interrogation.
The distinction is made through-

out the Regulations between a ""police constable"" on the one
hand and a ""police officer"" on the other hand and Regulation 10 is therefore wide enough - and I think is intended
to enable a police officer to authorise either a police
constable or a member of H.M. Forces to arrest without warrant

for this period and for this purpose.

It is a valuable

regulation and it should not be ignored but it does presuppose

a specific authorisation by an officer of the R.U.C.

an arrest without warrant in certain circumstances - general

The person arrested may not be guilty of a crime although he

may be suspected or it. It must however be remembered in this
context that under Section 2(4) of the Act a person is deemed
to be guilty of an offence against the Regulations if he
does an act ""of such a nature as to be calculated to be
prejudicial to the preservation of the pace or maintenance of

acting or having acted, etc., within the use of those words in
Regulation 11.

1971.

How soon should a Detention Order be applied for?

There is no guidance under any of the Regulations on this
question.
However Section 132 of the Magistrates
Courts Act
1964 may provide a guide-line.
It could be argued In fact
that this section applies to a person arrested without warrant
under Regulation 11 of the Special Powers Act for the section
says:
""Where a person arrested without warrant is not within
24 hours of his arrest released from custody the member of the
R.U.C. in charge of the constabulary station where such person
is in custody shall bring him or have him brought before a
Magistrates' Court as soon as practicable thereafter but, in
any event, not later than

48

hours after his arrest"".

When

taken in isolation this section could apply to a person arrested
without warrant under Section 11 but I don t think it does

because when one reads it in conjunection with Section 131 of
the same Act and, indeed, Section 133, it contemplates a person
being arrested without warrant for an offence but under Regulation 11 a person may be arrested without warrant who has not

committed an offence but who is, for example, only suspected
of having committed an offence.
However the directions
contained in Section 132, even though they may not apply to
arrest under Regulation 11, might provide a useful guide-line,
and, accordingly, I would suggest that a Detention Order should
be applied for 24 hours after a person has been arrested if
that is practicable but, in any event, not later than 48 hours

after arrest.

Under Regulation 11 made under that Act any member of Her Majesty's
forces on duty when the occasion for the arrest arises may arrest without
warrant any person who is suspected of having committed an offence
against the Regulations.
2.
Any member of Her Majesty's Forces on duty may also, where it is
necessary for the purpose of effecting an arrest in respect of anycrime
or any offence under the Regulations made under the Civil Authorities (Special
Powers) Act Northern Ireland, 1922, exercise, by virtue of that Act, the
like powers as may be exercised by a police constable in effecting
arrest in a case where an arrestable offence has been committed.
Under
Section 2 (4) of the Act, a person shall be deemed to be guilty of an
offence against the Regulations if he does any act of such nature as to
be calculated to be prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or
maintenance of order in Northern Ireland and not specifically provided
for in the Regulations.
3.
When arresting a person under this order the soldier making the
arrest is to say ""I am arresting you under the powers conferred by the
Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act(orthern Irelad) 1922"".
If the
person arrested questions the authority for the arrest eg by asking what
offence he has committed or under what Regulation he is arrested the
soldier making the arrest is to. say ""I am not required to give any
further explanation.
I warn you that if you resist arrest you may be
committing an offence"".
4.
After the person has been arrested, units are to arrange that the
soldier making the arrest brings him to the appropriate Police Office and
hands him over to a police officer or police constable notifying him of
the full circumstances of the arrest in accordance with the procedure
laid down in Annex B to Part 3 Section 3 of Northern Ireland Standing
Security Instruction 1971.
If it is operationally impracticable in any
case for the soldier making the arrest to go with the person arrested to
hand him over to the RUC the dispensation given in paragraph 4c of the
Instruction referred to may be exercised but the greatest care is to be
taken in complying with that instruction particularly as regards
continuity of evidence.

1. If the pakage deal does indeed turn out to be internment
in exchange for a ban on parades for six months coupled with
no new rifle clubs, the following thoughts occur to me.
The package deal itself.
a.

Internment. In Whitehall we do not know enough about
the list of 520? possible internees. Whose property is
this list once Mr FAULKNER requests the deal andHMG
agrees it? Who are the Protestants on this list? Accepting
that we know the criteria for selection, who has been
considered and discarded and why? Is the list of wanted
men to be made public once internment is introuced? If
not why not, as information about known and publicied wanted
men is bound to be more available than about faceless men?

b.

The ban on parades. What does this really mean? How
flexible is this ban? Surely there would be merit in preserving some room for manoeuvre for HMG by agreeing in
private to a six month ban (subject to review?) but saying
in public that the ban is 'until further notice'. This

OUT THE REAL ADVANTAGE TO MR LYNCH OF INTRODUCING INTERNMEMT IN THE

PREFER TO OMIT ALL AFTER '' WHICH THIS WOULD BRING'. I DO NOT THINK
THAT MR LYNCH WUOLD REGARD DIRECT RULE AS A DISASTER, ALTHOUGH HE
WOULD REGRET ITS. INTRODUCTION. NOR DO I THINK THAT MR LYNCH HAS

(1) WE KNOW THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT HAVE DECIDED ON A TOUGH
LINE AGAINST BOTH I R A FACTIONS, AND EVEN IF CONVICTIONS ARE
NOT OBTAINED IN COURTS THEY WILL HARASS THEM BY ADMINISTRATIVE
ACTION. THE MINSTER OF FINANCE REPEATED THIS TO ME LAST SATURDAY,
AND ADDED THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOT REPEAT NOT EXCLUDED.

IT WOULD,

HOWEVER, BE AN EXTREMELY CONTENTIOUS POLITICAL ISSUE, WHICH MIGHT
NECESSITATE RECALLING THE DAIL. MR LYNCH WOULD IN ANY CASE BE
ACCUSED BY SIN FEIN OF ACTING IN COLLUSION WITH US, AND I DO NOT
SEE HOW HE COULD AGREE TO ANY TIMING WHICH WOULD CONFIRM SUCH
SUSPICIONS. IT MIGHT THEREFORE BE EASIER IF INTERNMENT COULD BE
INTRODUCED AFTER, AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, SIMILAR ACTION IN
NORTH, I CANNOT SEE HIM

AGREEING TO SYNCHRONISED ACTION.

THE

BUT THIS

IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF POINT THAT I COULD DISCUSS WITH HIM IN
SECRET.
(11) I CANNOT COMMENT ON YOUR POINT A UNTIL I KNOW WHAT THE
DECISION IS:
BUT IN ANY CASE I HOPE WE CAN LET THE IRISH KNOW IT IN ADVANCE,
IN VIEW OF THE EXTEME IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACH TO IT.
(III) POINT B. MY GUESS ON THE LIKELY REPLY IS THAT HE IS INDEED
THINKING ABOUT INTERNMENT; THAT INTERNMENT IN THE NORTH WOULD HAVE
OBVIOUS
REPERCUSSIONS IN THE SOUTH BUT THAT HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
TO SEE WHAT THESE ARE BEFORE TAKING A DECISION
(IV) POINT D. COULD I BE GIVEN A GENUINE BUT ANODYNE MESSAGE TO
CONVEY? I SHOULD ALSO SEER HIS AGREEMENT THAT OUR DISCUSSION ON
INTERNMENT

IS TOTALLY DENIABLE AND HAS NOT TAKEN

PLACE.

(V) YOUR PARA 3. I CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THESE POINTS BUT UNLESS I
CONCEDE THAT UNIONIST PRESSURE IS ONE AMONG A NUMBER OF FACTORS
I SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED.

",the next word  into consequentially drops out this will bring out the real advantage to mr lynch of introducing internmemt in the south aid this is our only positive argument secondly i would prefer to omit all after  which this would bring i do not think that mr lynch wuold regard direct rule as a disaster although he would regret its introduction nor do i think that mr lynch has the same view or peaceful coexistence as mr faulkner  the former is on a converging course the latter on a parallel but irish views are complex please ee mift 4 following are comments on your telegram number 146 1 we know that the irish government have decided on a tough line against both i r a factions and even if convictions are not obtained in courts they will harass them by administrative action the minster of finance repeated this to me last saturday and added that internment was not repeat not excluded  it would  however be an extremely contentious political issue which might necessitate recalling the dail mr lynch would in any case be accused by sin fein of acting in collusion with us and i do not see how he could agree to any timing which would confirm such suspicions it might therefore be easier if internment could be introduced after and so as a consequence of similar action in north i cannot see him  agreeing to synchronised action  the  but this  is exactly the sort of point that i could discuss with him in secret 11 i cannot comment on your point a until i know what the decision is but in any case i hope we can let the irish know it in advance in view of the exteme importance they attach to it iii point b my guess on the likely reply is that he is indeed thinking about internment that internment in the north would have obvious repercussions in the south but that he will have to wait to see what these are before taking a decision iv point d could i be given a genuine but anodyne message to convey i should also seer his agreement that our discussion on internment  is totally deniable and has not taken  place  v your para 3 i can certainly make these points but unless i concede that unionist pressure is one among a number of factors i shall not be believed

Rules for the internal

It was confirmed by the military representatives that a list of between

of these sight be involved in the initial operation.

The broad plan for

military aid to the civil power for the machinery of detention was in

The Army were working in

co-operation with Special Branch of the RUC to asses

how many interrogators

could be required for the post-detention period, and it had to be accepted
that these might well fall short of the ideal number.
Membership of a review tribunal was raised.

A panel of names was

already in existence but it was suggested that the chairman or perhaps one
other person might be nominated by the Home Office.

Mr Howard-Drake agreed

without comitment to examine this.
It was agreed that the public relations aspect of internment would be
important and that it would be helpful to draft statements on a contingency

International interest in internment would be such keener than on

the previous occasion on which they were put into effect in Northern Ireland,

Mr. Smith said that in his view recent IRA activity was grounded in
confidence,

not desperation.

The power of internment is contained in Regulation 12 made under the Civil
Authorities (Special Powers) Acts (Northern Ireland) 1922-43,
The power to
intern is such criticised and is inconsistent with the European Human Rights
Convention;

a notice of derogation was lodged in 1957.

The powers contained

in Regulation 12 were last used during the IRA campaign against Northern Ireland
front 1956-62.

is called for - to

release,

to intern or to charge under criminal legislation

withan a period of about 7 days.

-

Regulation 11 confers powers of deention and in practice further action

2.

It is not thought that these powers are much

in-point at present.
Before his resignation Major Chichester-Clark was asked from time to time

3.

whether he was contemplating the use of internment powers.

The standard reply

which he evolved was that his security advisers - the GOC and the Chief Constabledid not recommend it at the time, but if they were to recommend it he would not
hesitate to act.

Since he succeeded as northern Ireland Prime Minister

Mr Faulkner has confirmed that this is his view on the introduction of internment.
The Northern Ireland Government has a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before
making a final decision.

Mr Heath said in Edinburgh on 27

arch that the power

of internment lay in the hands of the Northern Ireland Government.

It

had

often been stated by Stormont spokesmen, he said, that such measures as internment can only be taken if the Joint Security Committee advises it, but Mr Heath

said his Government had never been asked to sanction such a measure.
4.

On 4 December 1970 the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice of the Irish

Republic issued a statement about their readiness to reactivate powers of
internment without trial in the Republic because of information about plans for
a secret armed conspiracy.

The statement added that the Republic also had

lodged a notice of derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention
on human Rights.

But little has been heard from the Republic of any steps to

carry out the threat or of the alleged plot
behind the move.

Stout Esq CB
GOvernment Security adviser
Stormont Castle

Thank you for your letter of 27 April about providing accomodation in
the event of certain measures being put in hand in Northern Ireland.
I assorry the reply has taken so long but you will be glad to know
that in view of the difficulties you described, the ministry of Defence
have agreed to finance the construction of the accomodation for the
time being.
I understand that work has alreadystarted and that it there are no
delays or difficulties, accommodation for around 150 personwill be
in existence by the end of August or the beginning of September.
Perhaps you will find it useful if we could arrange another meeting
to discuss the terms onwhich Northern Ireland would use Ministry of
Defence property if it proves necessary to do so and the other
consequential arrangements such as staffing. I believe the possibility
of a further meeting between the ministry of Defence, yourselves and us

was envisaged at the meeting here on 16 April and we shall be glad to
arrange for another meeting either here or in Belfast on a convenient
date. its you already know, Jack Howard Drake has taken over this

subject from Robin North and he will make the necessary arrangements.

1.
Thank you for your letter of the 21 May about internment. You
will probably by now have seen Lord Carrington's minute to the
Prime Minister. I have discussed the practical arrangements which
need to be put in hand and I am pleased to say that work will begin
on it
June
giving a likely completion date ofend August/beginning
September for Phase 1 of the camp if it is required for internment
i.e. an accommodation for around 150 people with the necessary
security fencing,

etc.

2.
Now that the project is off the ground you may feel that we
should have discussions about any further contingency planning which
may be required.

3.

In completing the plans we have taken into account Mr Chamber's
comments. We propose to make ad hoc arrangements during the course
of construction to provide extra ""boxes""; and, provided the number
of internees is well below the 450 for which the camp will cater.
there will be no problem in providing a separate hut for visitors.
Should at any stage there be overcrowding in the camp, as Chambers

has pointed out, there is space for an extra hut in the camp layout.
But we would prefer not to go to that expense, unnecessarily, at the

present time.

4.
You may think that the next steps will bet be for you to brief
your successor and to suggest to him that he has a briefing session
on internment at some early stage which could also be an opportunity
for a general review of Home Office/Northern Ireland Government/
Ministry of Defence plans.

As to the first point, it is almost inconceivable that a
decision to intern would be taken by the Northern Ireland
Government without consultation with HMG at Westminster.
Like
Major Chichester-Clark, Mr. Faulkner has stated that he would
only contemplate internment if the Security Forces advised in
favour of it.
But in any event, to retain under the full control
of HMG in Westminster the premises necessary if internment is to
be physically put into effect, both in the short term solution
(Maidstone) and the long term (Long Kesh), is a powerful means of
ensuring that the Westminster Government retains a major, if not

12.

It should be added that:
to authenticate the cover story, it is essential that
(a)
the camp should be seen to be performing its secondary role;
it will therefore need to be occupied, as much as possible,
by British troops;
(b)

the project will be completed substantially under RE

auspices and will therefore not impede, nor be at the expense
of, other Army works projects in Northern Ireland;
13.

The essential points which emerge from this re-appraisal are:
(a)

So long as internment is regarded as a course which may

become necessary, HMG in Westminster, and through them the
Service element of the security forces in Northern Ireland,
have a joint interest with the Stormont Government in the
proper provision of internment facilities;
(b) this interest would be exclusively the concern of the
Westminster Government in a direct rule situation;

in the light of the continuing high force levels in
(c)
Northern Ireland in the foreseeable future, and of the
indifferent living conditions which some units have to endure,
the Ministry of Defence have a separate though related
interest in the accommodation which an internment camp, while
vacant, would provide:

internment purposes,

the camp could be immediately occupied

by troops and thereafter constantly and fully used.
14.
S of S is therefore invited to agree on reconsideration that
there is a good case for the Westminster Government's assuming
financial responsibility for the project at this stage at least,

and in particular, for the cost falling on the Ministry of Defence.
Though at the expense of less urgent items, funds could be made
available from Defence votes.

If S of S agrees, he may like to write to the Prime Minister
on the lines of the attached draft.

For the most rapid completion, quickly assembled material would

have to be used and military manpower employed for most of the construction.

Even so, and assuming a smooth work flow, the complete camp

would still take about 6 months to complete from the time that approval
was given.

However, construction can be phased to ensure that a viable

SUMMARY OF RECONNAISSANCE PARTY'S FINDINGS

A.

LONG TERM SOLUTION

1.

The disused airfield at Long Kesh provides the most suitable

location, convenient to Belfast but away from populated areas, and with
a military presence close by.

The best site would be where two old

runways intersect, giving a solid base on which to build.
Accommodation
The proposed layout is:

2.

a.

For internees

and 1 holding 50.

5 separate compounds, 4 holding 100 each
This would provide for segregation by types

as well as by sexes if required.

(It would be intended to build

the 50-capacity hut as women's accommodation).
b.

For Custodians

A separate complex of buildings which would

house up to 100.
Cells, recreation rooms and spaces, reception and visitors'

3.

rooms

and other necessary facilities would need to be built, as part of the
camp.

An interrogation centre, however, should be housed outside the

camp area and could be an existing building suitably modified.

4.

All the facilities for the internees and their custodians can be

designed to double for Service accommodation so that the camp can be
used for that purpose.

For example, the custodians' facilities would

be based on a design for officers' and senior NCO's messes of battalion
size, and could be used as such.
Layout and Security Arrangements

5.

The internees' accommodation should be laid out withn two

perimeter fences, the inner one of chain-link, the outer faced with
corrugated iron.

Dannert wire should, in addition, be laid between the

two fences and/or guard dogs could patrol it.

There should be at

least one guard tower at each corner of the outer perimeter fence (which

would form a rectangle approximately 1000' x 550').

NORTHERN

IRELAND INTERNMENT CAMP - DRAFT SUBMISSION

1.
When BGS Headquarters Northern Ireland visited me yesterday I asked
him how far discussions with the RUC on internment have gone.
He replied
that the only contact had been with the Special Branch, primarily to ensure
that their list of potential internees is up to date, which it is not;
and to discuss the interrogation centre.
2.

I attach at Annex A a few comments on your draft

submission which

I think covers a complex subject very comprehensively.
I do however
feel that the case for a rapid ministerial decision to allow the
constructions work to start soonest would be strengthened by reference
to the inevitable world-wide interest in the living conditions, and
circumstances to be afforded to internees, which would not perhaps be
as good as they should be until the proposed Longkesh camp is built.
3.
I think you could also justify the immediate preparation of a
long term site by emphasising the unsuitability of any of the short
term solutions, of which the Maidstone is the most acceptable.

NORTHERN IRELAND
Further to my note of 19 March (not to all or necessary),
Mr Matthews and Captain Cook have returned from their visit to
Belfast where they considered MAIDSTONE's suitability as an
internment ship pending the construction of more permanent
arrangements ashore in Northern Ireland. A copy of their report
is attached. You will see that this reinforces the view which we
have already given to the Army Department that the MAIDSTONE is not
really suitable for this purpose. However, if it proves necessary
to provide secure accommodation without arousing suspicion that
internment regulations are about to be brought into force, then
MAIDSTONE could be used, at 48 hours notice, to provide reasonable
accommodation for up to 150 internees with the requisite guards.
The naval personnel aboard her would continue to provide hotel
services but would have to shift their presently held accommodation.
The advice is that provided the number of internees does not exceed
this level, and proper arrangements are made to keep them under
surveillance, then they should not be able maliciously to damage the
ship to any serious extent; nor should they be able, by their own
folly, to put at risk other internees.

-

2.
As soon as the intention to intern had been announced it would
be possible to bring workmen in - probably from Harland and Wolff
to protect vulnerable services in the fore part of the ship so that,
within about two weeks, it would be possible to move the internees
to a more secure area and increase their numbers up to about 300.
This should provide adequate accommodation for the matter of weeks
which it would take to provide accommodation ashore. The Army
authorities in Northern Ireland who were associated with the
examination are satisfied that they could arrange for exercises,
visiting, interrogation and medical services on an ad hoc basis for
the comparatively short period while the MAIDSTONE would be used for
this purpose. They and the naval divers already provide a high
standard of protection against external attack.

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNMENT CAMP RECONNAISSANCE PARTY
Introduction
1.
Colonel McNabb returned from his reconnaissance in Northern Ireland
on 17 March and I debriefed him on the afternoon of 18th. He made the points
set out in the following paragraphs.
2.
Maidstone. The reconnaissance team looked over Maidstone, together with
the Home Office representative,and concluded that it would provide
satisfactory short term internment accommodation. They thought that it would
not be useful for longer than one month. HQ Northern Ireland were content
that they could make adequate security arrangements, but would like a Naval
export to be briefed by the Home Office and then to visit and inspect
Maidstone to advise on any internal work which may or may not be necessary
before it could be used for internment.
Maidstone remains and is confirmed as HQ Northern Ireland's most suitable
short term solution.

3.

Ballykinler. The camp at Ballykinler provides suitable accommodation
for internment, but its situation - (it is near the sea, access roads
adjacent to UDR camp, and wooded areas) - is most unsutiable for internment
use. The Home Office expert was most unhappy at the idea of using the
camp, two huts of which have been blown up in recent months.

4.

Longkesh. The reconnaissance party found a most suitable site adjacent
to Longkesh 1 Camp where runways and taxi tracks provide good hard standings
for the erection of a camp. Unfortunately this site is just within the
area reserved to a meteorological station and there could be some difficulty
in using this area because of possible interference with the radar instruments.
This problem is now being investigated by Colonel McNabb and it is thought
it can be overcome.

5.

6.
There are a number of problems which require clear Home Office
instructions before the final design of the camp can be completed. These are:a. Status. The present terms of reference state that internees
should be treated as convicted criminals. The Home Office
official was most unhappy with this definition and believed that
there would be humanitarian pressures to provide for creature
comforts. Home Office guidance is urgently needed to say:(1)

The space to be allowed for each prisoner.

(2)

The maximum number of prisoners per hut.

(3) The provision of bed lighting and provision of
curtains.

(4) Whether visits by families are to be allowed, and
if so under what conditions i.e. regular visiting hours
daily.
b.
Cells. The reconnaissance team believe that at least six
cells would be necessary and are including these in their
plane, and-also that it would be necessary to provide an

d.

Security.

An ideal site must be both secure enough to

prevent escape from inside and also secure and preferably
remote enough to reduce the chances of an attack or liberation

It should be away from politically
sensitive areas both to avoid aggravating public feeling and.
reduce the chance of large scale demonstrations;

e.

Size.

It has been assumed that up to 450 internees

would need to be accommodated.
Any variation on this figure
could affect the selection but particularly if a very much
smaller number were to be interned;

involved to some degree;

Great Britain and the Isle of Man

.

3.
On Home Office advice the use of Great Britain either in
terms of prisons or other accommodation or even the use of a
Great Britain anchorage has been ruled out because legislation
at Westminster would be required to enable internees to be
accommodated in this country or in its territorial waters.
(under existing law prisoners in Northern Ireland can only be
transferred to prisons
inGreat Britain at their own request)
The Isle of Man has also been ruled out:
not only would legislation in Northern Ireland end the Isle of Man be necessary, but
any scheme would also need prior discussion and agreement with the

Isle of Man Government, which is highly unlikely to be forthcoming

48 hrs. The other ships mentioned above would take about three
weeks to be prepared and towed to Northern Ireland. Any ship would
need a suitable alongside berth with power supplies and other
essential services from the shore.

6.

The use of a naval vessel raises the following problems:
a.

any ship chosen would need a suitable alongside berth

with power supplies and other essential services from ashore
Only in Belfast, where security problems are likely to be

especially difficult, is this degree of support likely to
be available;
b.
Electrical leads, fire and water mains and valves run
throughout the ships both in alleyways and many compartments

and it seems likely that only by ""enclosing"" the internees
within a complex of wire grills would the internal safety of
the ship be assured.
c.

As well as the planning work that this would involve,

time would be required to take the ship to a dockyard in
order to effect the necessary modifications. This is likely
to take at least a matter of weeks.

Clearly the removal of MAIDSTONE from her present
berth for the purpose of carrying out such work is likely
to attract comment.
It would in any case be difficult to
preserve security once a ship was taken into dockyard hands
and the nature of the work became known.

Rathlin Island and Copeland Island are the only
practical alternatives.
Both islands would require a good deal

for internees and their guards) and communications facilities.
This would be bound to attract public comment and it would be
impossible to keep the true reason for the work from becoming
known.
(Note: recent military visits to Rathlin Island have
already led to public speculation whether an internment camp was

being contemplated there).

COMMITTEE ON NORTHERN IRELAND
INTERNMENT

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the
Home Department and the Secretary of State for Defence

Regulation 12 made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts
(Northern Ireland) 1922-43 confers on the Northern Ireland Government the
power to intern without trial.

The power to intern is much criticised and

is inconsistent with the European human Rights Convention but in the course
of the I.R.A. activities of 1956-62 a notice of derogation was

in 1957

lodged in Strasbourg.
Internmnt has been used in the past against I.R.A. activity both

North and South of the Border.

In response to recent demanded for internment

the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland has said that if the security advisersthe G.O.C. and the Chief Constable of the R.U.C. - recommend that these powers
should be used he would not hesitate to act.

But the Northern Ireland

Goverment have a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before making a final
decision.
3.

The Government of the Irish Republic have announced their readiness

to reactivate power of internment against conspiracies to kidnap prominent

persons and the Government of the Republic recently lodged a notice of
derogation with the EuropeanCommission.

At present the demand for Internment is not vociferous, but continuing

interest may easily produce a climate in which the
feels compelled to press us to agree to it.

This additional work could be carried out within the existing resources of
the Army and can be plausibly represented as providing accomodation for

1.

The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the processes of

interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments
and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal
security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war.

The

techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many
previous internal security situations.

The latest instructions on the rules to

be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the
daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the
Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen QC issued in November 1966
(Cmd,3165).

2.

These general rules include the following safeguards:
a.

Medical examination

nd record of weight of subject on

b.

Subjects to be seen daily by Medical Officer,

c.

The following are prohibited:
(i)

violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation,
cruel treatment and torture;

(ii)

outrages upon personal dignity, in particular,
humiliating and degrading treatment.

d.

Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline.

under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in
Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of

Prisoners of War (1949).)

SUNDAY TIMES INSIGHT TEAM
Bruce Page rang the S of S's private office shortly after
internment (Auust 10) to ask for an interview with S of S on
Northern Ireland. At that time our policy was for S of S not to
take part in TV or press interviews since the Northern Ireland
Government and the Home Office were taking the lead on the policy of
internment. I telephoned Page on Friday 13 August to turn down his
request. He said he would like to talk to an official or a soldier
about the success or failure of internment.
I said he must go to
the Home Office on that topic. He went on to indicate that he knew
that General Tuzo had argued against the policy at the meeting with
Mr Faulkner in London and some of the detail he added indicated to
me that someone had been talking to him unwisely. I repeated the
public line taken by the Home Office at the time of internment, but
Page told me his information about the GOC's attitude came from No 10
and the Home Office. He went on to discuss the situation in Ulster
in terms which left me in no doubt that his sympathies lay with the

trouble-makers in Ulster.
Yesterday I heard from DPR(A) that Bruce Page had approached
the former Chief of Staff, Brigadier Dyball, and asked for ""the

inside story"" of his period of service in Ulster. This request has,
of course, been refused. DPR(A) also reports to me that the Insight
representative in Northern Ireland, Murray Sayle, is considered by
the Army to be unreliable and hostile.
We have spoken about this and all the evidence indicates that
the Insight team should be treated with extreme caution. I have
asked DPR(A) to let HQ Northern Ireland have our views.
One final point. It is not without inte that some of the
names of internees mentioned in last Sunday's Insight article are
also mentioned in the story on Ulster in the current Private Eye
(""Gone to Lynch"" pp 19/20). This is written under the heading
""Footnotes"" which presumably indicates that it is written by Paul
Foot himself. However, what is very evident is that Insight and
Private Eye (who have been straight pro IRA on Ulster) may have
access to the same sources.

POINTS FOR CABINET

The following list of topics for possible discussion in

this

evening is

framed against

the background that:

the PM is unable to hold a separate meeting
on Northern Ireland before Cabinet, but would
be willing to hold one immediately after Cabinet
if you so wished, with Philip Allen and Stewart
Crawford.

AUS(GS) will be visiting Belfast tomorrow,
departing early in the morning, for talks with
the GOC and others.

The points for possible discussion this
a.

evening are:

Interrogation of Detainees
We are told that
the RUC team who have been doing the interrogation
have already obtained so much material that they
want to break off the questioning while they
analyse the information already gleaned.
This
has been agreed by Stout, and the Army team
which has been supporting the RUC has been told
to prepare to withdraw.
DGI considers that a
complete halt would be very bad tactics and
that at least some of the RUC team should
continue the questioning while others are
analysing the material already obtained.
There
is some urgency about this since, once the
teams have been stood down,it will take time
to re-activate them.
Hockaday, who has already raised the point
with Home Office, suggests that you simply
draw attention to it and say that, unless there
are any objections from colleagues, you propose
to get the GOC and UK Rep to pursue it with the
NI Government.
It is a little doubtful whether this item
ought to be discussed in full Cabinet but, if
you are not keen on a separate meeting, there
is probably no real objection to raising it
in Cabinet.

5.
The satisfactory manner in which potential trouble in Londonderry on
12th August was dealt with has for the time being strengthened the Government's
hand in its dialogue with its right-wing critics in the Parliamentary Party.
At a meeting of this group on 13th August, there was apparently no opposition
to Major Chichester-Clark's leadership, and no serious criticism of his Government's policies.
6.
The Administration is now much more confident than at the beginning of
last week, when the Craig challenge was at its peak.
There remains the
probability of a meeting of the Unionist Council, a body some 700 strong, at
which the Party membership at the grass roots constituency level could, to the

7.
The rioting in Belfast which egan on 30th July had spent itself by 5th
August but on that evening Londonderry began to erupt and during the next four
nights there were constant attacks by the Bogside youths on the Army accompanied.
by the erection of barricades, arson and some petrol bombing.
Explosions and
malicious fires were reported from various parts of the Province but mostly in
Belfast and the south-east, although the electricity sub-station in Magherafelt,
Co Londonderry, was badly damaged by a gelignite explosion on the afternoon of
Sunday, 9th August.
The climax occurred on the night of 11th August at
Crossmaglen, Co Armagh, within a mile of the Border when two RUC constables died
while examining a stolen car which exploded when its door was opened.
This was
naked terrorism; the car was obviously parked as a bait for the Security Forces
and might have been opened by either an Army or a police patrol.
It is
estimated that there must have been at least 15 lbs of gelignite in the vehicle.
Belfast
8.
Although the Belfast rioting was not instigated directly by either of the
IRA groups, members of the IRA undoubtedly encouraged and assisted the
Republican hooligans who took the major part in it.
The motivation was hatred
of the British Army which was fanned by the killing of young O'Hagan.
A
campaign of vilification was concurrently mounted by the newly formed West
Belfast Democratic Socialist Alliance, a loose confederation of Republicans,
Communists and members of the National Democratic Party.
The most prominent
personality in this group is one Desmond O'Hagan who has a subversive and

criminal record dating from 1957 both in London and Northern Ireland and is
recorded as a member of both the Communist Party and the IRA.
He has been
described by the London Special Branch as clever, ruthless and capable of

It would appear therefore that we are faced with a revival of the

Northern Ireland personalities and sabotage of Government buildings and public
utilities planned and carried out by groups or individuals acting independently.

Gallagher is alleged to have been killed by the Tynan Platoon of the USC last
year.
Opportunity was taken to attack the judiciary and the RUC for failing
to take any action in this case even though a year has passed.
Outlook
18.
The political attack on the Government has, for the present, been
contained, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are likely to remain under
pressure from hardline Unionists to enforce ""law and order"" by which they really
mean punitive action against Catholics.
The fact that these same people
encourage or acquiesce in illegal Protestant processions is conveniently
ignored.
Further defiance of the ban may lead to Republican counter demonstrations, but there are signs that the moderates in the troubled areas are
sick and tired of violence and are prepared to try to stop it provided the
Security Forces are not obliged to intervene in strength.
19.
The main threat now comes from extremist Republican/IRA groups both in
Ulster and Eire who believe they can maintain tension to prevent government
by attacks on Government property and personnel and from Protestant extremists
who also wish to discredit the Government by acts of intimidation and
terrorism.

right they will do away with the Special Powers.

The idea that

has been in their minds, though it has not been made public,

is that

the Regulations under the Acts should be put into suspense unless
called into operation by an emergency proclamation by the Governor;
and that permanent legislation should be enacted creating certain
permanent new offences against the State.

Mr. Callaghan told the

Northern Ireland Government that we would send a note of our
views.

No note has been sent, but at official level our view is

that it would be better to repeal the Acts altogether and start
afresh with a new Act enabling Regulations to be made on a
proclamation of emergency;

that there should be no new permanent

offences against the State of the kind the Northern Ireland

INNORTHERN IRELAND

Major Chichester-Clark has been publicly asked from time to time

in recent months whether he is contemplating internment. The standard
reply which he has evolved is that his security advisers - the GOC and
the Chief Constable - do not recommend it at present, but if they were
to recommend it he would not hesitate to act.
This is not an entirely
satisfactory formula in that it might be read as an abdication by the

Prime Minister of political responsibility for the decision.

Home Office

doubts on this score have been conveyed privately to the Secretary
to the Cabinet and it is known that both the former GOC and the present
Chief Constable feel that they are being publicly placed in a somewhat
invidious position. There is however a clear and firm understanding
between the two governments, frequently renewed and kept in good repair,
that there could be no question of internment being adopted without
full consultation with HMG.
2.
If internment were thought necessary the Northern Ireland Government
would be in considerable practical difficulties. The advice of the
security forces is that the numbers involved would be something between

used. The main prison in Belfast is full, and anyway being in the Crumlin
Road is in an area which would present serious additional security
problems. The only other prison in Northern Ireland, in Armagh, could
only hold a fraction of the numbers - perhaps 80 - is dangerously near
the border and in a part of the town which makes it particularly difficult
to guard. High turrets completely bullet proof would have to be
erected inside the prison and despite their protection would be a perpetual
target for snipers.
Internment camps could be got ready elsewhere in Northern Ireland

notably in Rathlin Island, off the north coast, but the preparations
would be obvious and their purpose clear. The consequent effect on the
political and security situation would be most damaging, notwithstanding
the statements made by Mr Lynch about his willingness to use similar
powers in the south if necessary.
4.
In December 1970 in a period of comparative calm the Northern
Ireland Government suddenly asked through the United Kingdom Government
representative whether emergency contingency plans could be put in hand
to make HMS MAIDSTONE, anchored in Belfast Lough, available as a place
of detention for internees. HMS MAIDSTONE is a former submarine depot
ship at present used to provide accommodation for troops. Both the
Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary found this proposition
unattractive. The idea was somewhat too sensational and would immediately
invite comparison with the hulks and would no doubt prove more photogenic
than a prison or a barbed wire camp.
5.
As the Cabinet has recently noted, a decision to inter would need
the most careful consideration. It is the view of the GOC and of the
Chief Constable that even if all known activists were picked up, others
at present unknown would immediately step into their place and
recruitment to the IRA generally would receive further impetus.

soon for any clear or reliable indications of progress, the Commissioner
of Police reports that the detective chief superintendent in charge
of the case is not unhopeful that he may be able to get information
which the RUC have been unable to get and perhaps go some way towards
breaking the hold of the Brady gang. Even if he can penetrate the
wall of silence which always obstructs the RUC in these cases, there
will be formidable problems in protecting witnesses and juries from
intimidation. Nevertheless this is the first new constructive
approach that we have been able to put in hand: it is in line with
statements by the two governments that subversive elements will be

brought under the rule of the law: and to activate the internment
powers would immediately bring to an abrupt halt the police enquiries.
7.

All that said, it is possible to envisage a campaign of

assassination and perhaps kidnapping in which the two governments
would find a popular demand for internment too great to resist.
8.
The recent active involvement of the IRA provisionals in
attacks on the security forces and on civilians has led both the
Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to think it right to seek
Ministerial authority to study the question of internment further.

Chichester-Clark know in confidence the HMG has authorised the
putting in hand of a contingency study (rather than a contingency
plan) dealing with the practical problems of internment in the course
of which officials would be instructed to consult as necessary with
the Northern Ireland Government. There is no doubt that this would
be welcome news to Major Chichester-Clark. There is the inevitable
risk, indeed likelihood, that some members at least of his government,
will be encouraged to press hard for internment on the first plausible
pretext once they know that the physical arrangements are under study.
Nevertheless it seems right to put this in hand and Major ChichesterClark who has warmly welcomed the assistance now being given by the
Metropolitan Police will be fully alive to the risk of putting this
enquiry in jeopardy,and has shown in a number of his public statements
that he is conscious of the repercussions not only of public
opinion in Northern Ireland but internationally if internment were
in fact to be undertaken.

MINISTER

NORTHERN IRELAND:

SPECIAL COURTS

The reason for internment is that while a good deal is
known about internees, the evidence,

such as it is, would

not in most cases stand up in court according to normal
legal tests; further, even if the evidence were sufficient,
there would be obvious objections to disclosing its nature
to the defence or allowing a confrontation between the
security forces and the accused.

It is, therefore,

sometimes suggested that special courts should be set up
with their own procedure so that in appropriate cases persons
at present interned could be brought before them.

I have now

considered this matter further and consulted the
Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General to see whether
anything can be done to overcome our difficulties by setting
up such courts.

If the problem were simply that juries perversely
refused to convict, it would be possible by legislation to
dispense with the jury system in such cases and to substitute
appointed judges, magistrates or assessors.

This is broadly

the procedure which has been adopted in the past in the
Republic of Ireland.

regards rules of evidence and standards of proof.

This

would not do for us.
What we need is a procedure to protect witnesses and
sources of information.

The Lord Chancellor tells me that

it would be possible to devise

a procedure for such

circumstances which could nevertheless be regarded as
judicial.

The procedure would have to be very different

from court procedure as known in this country.

It would be

inquisitorial; the court would be able to ask the accused
questions and draw inferences from refusal to answer;
material provided on deposition could also be put to the
accused.

We might also provide that hearsay evidence was

to be admissible (and this would undoubtedly increase the
number of cases in which we might look for a conviction).
The court would need to be given power to impose a sentence
instead of an open-ended internment order.
It would have to be accepted that such a procedure
would make fundamental inroads into the protection which we
normally give in this country to an accused person.

It

would deprive him of the right to face his accuser and to
contest any evidence before the court which had not been

Further, there would be cases,

particularly where the information against the internee

available evidence could not be put before the court at all
because none of it could be put to the accused.

The question

must, therefore, remain how much better off we should be at
the end of the day by using this procedure.

We must bear

in mind that:(a) special courts of this kind could be set up only
by legislation which would have to go through our
Parliament.

controversial and, having faced the criticisms,
we might not get as many convictions as we might

Our critics could say, with some justice,
that a special court operating such procedures is
no more than a second ""Star Chamber"".

some experience of mixing inquisitorial and
accusatorial systems in the Dutschke tribunal.
This proved highly unsatisfactory.

And Widgery does

not have the special problem that, in dealing with the

answer to our problem.

me, the only solution is for us to decide gradually to let

These are incorporated with several other comments that we have

I am sorry he notes on the Moore case are long but it has
been assumed that you have little information on it so far and
it was necessary to give you some background. There are a
number of questions that could arise other than those which
were mentioned in GEN 77 yesterday. As you will see from our
comments, the Prime Minister is recommended to avoid getting
into the details of thiscase on the grounds that Moore was
only detained for 48 hours and not subjected to interrogation
in depth or the techniques discussed in the Parker Report.

has been discussed between the Ministry of Defence and the Home
Office, and it has been agreed that:

1715,IMG_4931_PREM_15_475,"CASE OF W J MOORE

1.
W J Moore was arrested in the early morning of 9 August
1971 by Servicemen and removed to the Regional Holding Centre
Ballykinler where he was placed in an empty hut with others
who had been arrested.
He was guarded in the hut by soldiers.
He was transferred to the Maidstone early on 11 August and
released on 24 August.
At some unspecified time thereafter, he
disappeared over the Border into the Republic whence he has not
officially returned.
On 13 September, a writ was issued on his
behalf claiming damages for wrongful arrest and imprisonment
and assault, trespass to the person and battery.
2.
The preliminary hearing of the case took place on 2 and 17
November when the question of the discovery of documents was
dealt with.
Only one Ministry of Defence document, a Brigade
Order less some appendices, was withheld on grounds of security,
and the Judge accepted the Secretary of State's certificate
without apparent demur on 17 November.
The RUC attempted to
withhold a number of documents mainly on the grounds of the need
to protect the identity of individuals but the Judge refused
to accept Mr Faulkner's certificate and Counsel appealed against
this ruling.

3.

On 22 November the main hearing began, and the Plaintiff
failed to appear.
His Counsel argued that the failure was due
to fear of further arrest and that this fear was justified by the
fact that ""military personnel had made a number of visits to his
home."" Although Moore was wanted by the Police for questioning,
this was not revealed to the Judge nor were Moore's false
allegations refuted.
In fact military personnel had paid one
visit only to Moore's house in the company of the civil police.
An undertaking not to arrest Moore was demanded by Counsel as a
precondition of appearance, but the Civil Police naturally refused.
The case was adjourned until 22 December when, in the absence of
an undertaking to Moore, the Judge ruled that his evidence could
be taken in absentia by virtue of a sworn affidavit.
The case was
reopened on 19 January when Counsel for the Crown gave notice of
appeal against both the disclosure of RUC documents and the
hearing of the case in the plaintiff's absence.
The plaintiff
waived the claim for disclosure and the Judge decided to hear
the case.
4.
At the end of the six-day hearing he reserved his judgment
which was delivered on 18 February.
The judgment was that the
plaintiff had been wrongfully arrested and detained (due to
procedural irregularity) and that he had suffered sufficient in
the way of assault, even if many of the allegations of serious
ill-treatment had not been proved, to justify the award of
the total sum of £300 claimed.
This can be construed to mean
broadly that the Judge considered the treatment established

by the Compton Report by itself to constitute assault as justifying
the portion of the £300 damages which was not attributable to
wrongful arrest and imprisonment.

together with the Judgment of McGonigal, J., in re James McIlduff, unreported,
but the type script of which was provided by th

parties.

Following the Christie and McIlduff canes, I hold that the Plaintiff should
have been at least informed that he was being detained for interrogation for a
Period of 48 hours, and, if he was going to be charged with an offence,

then

he should have been told with what offence he was going to be charged.

Thus, he

would have known then what situation he had to moot, his family would have known
what to tell a Solicitor had he or they sought to employ one, and been properly
advised.

If nothing else, a question could have arisen as to whether the Plaintiff

was entitled to be cautioned before the interrogation took place following a
detention under Regulation 10, and even as to what Regulation 10 authorised eg
48 actual hours of interrogation?

The original arrest was, therefore, wrongful and the Plaintiff is entitled
to damages upon that score.

It is a pure technicality which need never have

occurred, but one upon which the Plaintiff can rely.

Before considering the second question in detail, I should perhaps say that
a further issue as to the wrongfulness of the arrest and detention could arise
by reason of the fact that the Plaintiff was supposed to have been transferred
to ""a suitable Police Office"";

1756,IMG_4972_PREM_15_475,"21st February, 1972.

Sir,
I am directed by the Governor of Northern Ireland to refer to my
letter of February 10, in which I acknowledged your telex message of
February 9, and said that His Ecellency had caused it to be referred
to his advisers, in accordance with the Constitution. Lord Grey has
since received an undated document, headed ""Ad Hoc Conference to bring
about an end to Imprisonment without Trial"", which shows that copies
of the telex message were sent to a number of persons, including the
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Secretary of State for the
Home Department, but not to Ministers here.
Your telegram urged the ending of internment upon the sole ground
that it had not worked, but the message made a number of other very
serious criticisms of theprinciple and practice of internment and
these merit a reasoned reply.
Imprisonment without trial was described as being ""unjust"" and
I am to observe that although article 5 of the Convention
""immoral"".
for the protection of Human Right and Fundamental Freedoms declares
the principle that no one shall be deprived of his liberty unless
convicted by a court of law, or for certain other limited reasons,
article 15 recognises that this principle may have to be abrogated ""in
time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the
nation"". The Ad hoo Conference presumably questions the moral right,
or indeed the duty, of the Government of Northern Ireland to protect
the community against armed terrorists by this means.
The Government of Northern Ireland has, with regret, deemed it
necessary to intern people as a measure directed against organisations
whose declared aim it is to overthrow the institutions of the state by
violence, including indiscriminate attacks against the civilian
population.
Such organisations have been denounced by the Churches in
Northern Ireland, including the Roman Catholic Church. The Government
regrets, therefore, that internment here should be described in your
message as ""sectarian"".
His Excellency's advisers strenuously contest the claim in your
message that internment has caused death and destruction. So far from
its being a cause of death and destruction, it was introduced only
because other measures had proved inadequate to counter thecampaign

There are great difficulties in preventing control of internment camps from
passing to the IRA leadership, but the opening of a new compound for the less
intransigent provides an opportunity for establishing proper control.

4.

An experienced governor of this new compound could also help to decide

whether the paper sift of the less dangerous was reasonably accurate and devise
a regime to prepare the men for release.

It is unlikely, however, that the Northern Ireland Prison Service will be

able to provide a Governor with the necessary qualities.

It is, therefore,

proposed to look for a suitable man from the Prison Service here.

(The Governor

from the English service seconded to take charge of Magilligan Camp is reported
to be doing well.)

The opening of another compound also means that a more senior man is

needed to take charge of and manage the camp as a whole.

this too will have to be done by a governor from the Prison Service here.

THE MAJORITY REPORT

OUR APPROACH
1

""Terrorism"" no doubt connotes violence, and violence for political ends.

This could arise under normal conditions, in which case those suspected of
such conduct would be dealt with in the same way as any other persons suspected
of crime.

We do not, however, construe our terms of reference as including in

our inquiry ordinary police interrogation.

We have accordingly confined our

inquiry to interrogation in circumstances where some public emergency has arisen
as a result of which suspects can legally be detained without trial.
2

We also read our terms of reference as calling upon us to inquire quite

generally into the interrogation and custody of persons suspected of terrorism
in such circumstances in the future,

Northern Ireland.

and not specifically in connection with

In particular, we are not called upon to consider afresh

matters already dealt with in the Compton Report (Cmnd Paper 4823).

Further,

while in our view the use of some if not all the techniques in question would
constitute criminal assaults and might also give rise to civil proceedings under
English law, we refrain from expressing any view in respect of the position in
Northern Ireland in deference to the courts there, before whom we understand
proceedings which raise this issue are pending.
3

As our inquiry progressed it became clear that the only ""procedures

currently authorised"", in the sense of authorised by the civil power, were such
as could be said to comply with the Joint Directive on Military Interrogation of
17 February 1965 (JIC(65)15), as amended in 1967 as a result of the Report of
Mr Roderic Bowen QC (Cmnd Paper 3165).

A note summarising the rules of this

Directive was published in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report but for the sake of
accuracy we set out in the Appendix such extracts from this Directive as are
immediately relevant to our inquiry.
4

It will be seen that this Directive,

though dealing with Internal Security

operations, refers to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment
of Prisoners of War (1949) and then sets out the principles contained in that
Article.

However, that Convention, Convention No III,

deals with international

warfare and the more apt Convention is Convention No IV, dealing with internal
civilian disturbances in which Article 3 is in the same terms.

",i  the majority report  our approach 1  terrorism no doubt connotes violence and violence for political ends  this could arise under normal conditions in which case those suspected of such conduct would be dealt with in the same way as any other persons suspected of crime  we do not however construe our terms of reference as including in  our inquiry ordinary police interrogation  we have accordingly confined our  inquiry to interrogation in circumstances where some public emergency has arisen as a result of which suspects can legally be detained without trial 2  we also read our terms of reference as calling upon us to inquire quite  generally into the interrogation and custody of persons suspected of terrorism in such circumstances in the future  northern ireland  and not specifically in connection with  in particular we are not called upon to consider afresh  matters already dealt with in the compton report cmnd paper 4823  further  while in our view the use of some if not all the techniques in question would constitute criminal assaults and might also give rise to civil proceedings under english law we refrain from expressing any view in respect of the position in northern ireland in deference to the courts there before whom we understand proceedings which raise this issue are pending 3  as our inquiry progressed it became clear that the only procedures  currently authorised in the sense of authorised by the civil power were such as could be said to comply with the joint directive on military interrogation of 17 february 1965 jic6515 as amended in 1967 as a result of the report of mr roderic bowen qc cmnd paper 3165  a note summarising the rules of this  directive was published in paragraph 46 of the compton report but for the sake of accuracy we set out in the appendix such extracts from this directive as are immediately relevant to our inquiry 4  it will be seen that this directive  though dealing with internal security  operations refers to article 3 of the geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war 1949 and then sets out the principles contained in that article  however that convention convention no iii  deals with international  warfare and the more apt convention is convention no iv dealing with internal civilian disturbances in which article 3 is in the same terms

In the result, we have come to the conclusion that, while long-term

mental injury cannot scientifically be ruled out, particularly in the case
of a constitutionally vulnerable individual,

there is no real risk of such

injury if proper safeguards are applied in the operation of these techniques.
We deal with suggested safeguards in paragraphs 35 to 42 below.

THE VALUE OF THE TECHNIQUES AND THE ALTERNATIVES
18

There is no doubt that when used in the past these techniques have

produced very valuable results in revealing rebel organisation, training and
'Battle Orders'.

Interrogation also sometimes had the effect of establishing

the innocence both of other wanted people and of the detainee himself.

19

Coming to recent times, the position in Northern Ireland prior to

August 1971 was that the Security Forces were in need of hard intelligence.
Information obtained by the RUC by ordinary police interrogation had failed to
provide anything but a general picture of the IRA organisation.

As a result

the Security Forces were hampered in their search for arms and explosives and
in addition were liable to harass and antagonise innocent citizens.

On the

introduction of internment two operations of interrogation in depth took place
involving the use of these techniques.

In August 1971 12 detainees and in

October 1971 two detainees were interrogated in depth.

20

As a direct result of these two operations the following new information

was obtained:
(1)

Identification of a further 700 members of both IRA factions,
and their positions in the organisations.

(2)

Over 40 sheets giving details of the organisation and structure
of IRA units and sub-units.

(3)

Details of possible IRA operations;

arms caches;

safe houses;

communications and supply routes, including those across the
border;

and locations of wanted persons.

It is also not without significance that the rate at which arms,

ammunition and explosives discovered in Northern Ireland by the Security
Forces increased markedly after 9 August, and much the greater part of the
haul has resulted either directly or indirectly from information obtained by
interrogation in depth.

Prime Minister

PROCEDURES

6 December

Very many thanks for your letter of 2 December.
appreciate what you said in the last paragraph.

1971

I did so

The Committee have now met and have considered the terms of
reference as given by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons and as
set out in your letter to me of the 18 November.
We are a little concerned that some might read these terms as
Terrorism no doubt
covering ordinary police inquiries into crime.
connotes violence and violence for political ends but this might occur
under ordinary conditions, e.g. violence by some body such as the Angry
Brigade.
We feel sure that you do not intend us to cover police
interrogation under ordinary conditions but only interrogation under emergency
conditions short of war such as prevail in Northern Ireland, e.g. where
persons can be lawfully detained without trial.
In these circumstances we would welcome a slight amendment to make
the terms read as follows:
""To consider whether, and if so in what respects - under
conditions in which persons suspected of terrorism can
be lawfully detained without trial in the traditional
Courts - the procedures currently authorised for the
interrogation of such persons and for their custody
while subject to interrogation require amendment.""

This is, I fear, a little cumbersome but we have tried to keep as
far as possible to what the Home Secretary said.
If however any difficulty might be thought to attach to an amendment,
we would be quite prepared to act on the original terms, stating in our Report
what our understanding of them is - always of course on the assumption that this
coincides with your understanding.
The Lord President has kindly agreed that we may use his office as
an accommodation address and has provided notepaper.

This in turn will load to the question of the results
interrogation as it is practised by theJSIW produces. Most which
of the
information which is given to the Committee on this point will
derived from our experience in Northern Ireland not,only becausebe it
is most recent and of most immediate concern to the Committee but
also because it is the best documented interrogation operation. But
the Co-ordinator does not propose to say too much himself in thi
preliminary briefing about the results obtained from interrogation
in Northern Ireland because he thinks that this will come most
effectively from the GOC, Northern Ireland, who can brief the
Committee on the overall military situation in Northern Ireland as it
was before the introduction of internment and as it is now, bringing
out the general state of intelligence before interrogation was used
and the improvement that has been achieved since. (BGS(Int) is
already arranging for the GOC to be warned that he will probably be
required to give evidence to the Committee and that he should be
thinking about what he will say and who should accompany him:
likely candidates are the D of I, the Chief Constable, the Head of
Special Branch and*
*(the RUC Inspector in charge of the
interrogation centre). It is being made clear to the GOC that it
will be for him to obtain the agreement of the Northern Ireland
Government to the Chief Constable and other members of the RUC giving
evidence.) As PUS knows, we are also preparing a paper for the
Committee on the results obtained from interrogation in Northern
Ireland (see paragraph 8below).

is needed on whether the Co-ordinator should
volunteer his report on interrogation methods of

should wait and see whether the Committee ask him
what his views on methods are and then offer it.
The dilemma here is that on the one hand to volunteer
it might appear to the Committee to be an attempt
by the Government to steer them to a particular
conclusion, whereas not to offer it straightaway

that we had been deliberately holding it back.

COMPTON REPORT: ARMY AND RUC VINDICATED
In speaking about the Report of the enquiry into allegations against
the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising
out of the events of the 9th August, 1971, the following points might
-

be made

1.

All charges of brutality against British troops and theRUC were
demolished.

Sir Edmund Compton's Committee reported that it found

no evidence of brutality, still less of torture or brain washin-.
The great majority of allegations are either found not to have
been proved or to have been untrue.
2.

The allegations examined by the Committee fell into two classes:
those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concerned
with the later process of interrogation.
Arrests - 342 men were arrested on August 9 in a highly successful
operation in very difficult circumstances. No force but the
minimumnecessary was used to achieve arrest. The men concerned
were likely to resist arrest and many of them were likely to
be armed; in these circumstances the army's performance was
highly creditable.
Interrogation - Interrogations are carried out by the security
forces upon principles laid down under the previous administration
and confirmed by the present administration.
Very difficult
issues are involved in judging what methods of interrogation are
permissible in the protection of the lives of the civil population
and the security forces against a ruthless and deliberate campaign
of terror and murder.
That is why the Government has appointed
a committee of Privy Councillors under Lord Parker to enquire
into them and see whether changes are necessary.

3.

The whole operation, arrests followed by the interrogation of a small
number of suspects (14),yielded information of great value

without

which the security forces could not defend the ordinary civilian
against the campaign of terror and murder.
4.

The operation should be seen against the background of the fight
against a ruthless and murderous enemy; that is to say criminals who

ish to impose their will by violence and terror. This year there have
been over 800 bomb explosions in Northern Ireland; hospitals have
treated nearly 600 victims of violence; of these more than 200 were
British soldiers; almost two thirds of the civilian casualties were
women including girls disfigured for life in explosions.
These things
have been done by the IRA.

Draft Statement by the Home Secretary
1.

The Report of the Committee under the chairmanship of

Sir Edmund Compton which I set up to inquire into allegations against
the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out
of events on 9th August is being published today and copies /will be available
in the Vote Office at 4 p.m.]
2.

The Government are grateful to the members of the Committee of

Inquiry for the care and thoroughness with which they carried out their
difficult task.
3.

Following the precedent of the Bowen report on Aden in 1966 this

report is published with an introduction by myself as Minister appointing
that inquiry.
4.

The Government have not found it necessary to omit anything from

the Report on grounds of security and it is, therefore,
5.

published in full.

The Compton Committee found no evidence of physical brutality by

the British Army or the RUC still less of torture or brain-washing.
6.

In the course of the arrest of 342 men on 9th August a small number

of them suffered what the Committee describe as a measure of ill-treatment
or hardship.

I think the House on studying the Report will conclude that this

operation, which was one of considerable difficulty and danger,

was

accomplished in a creditable manner.
7.

I made it clear to the Committee on the day they were appointed

that their terms of reference included complaints of physical brutality in
respect of a small number of men arrested on 9th August who were
interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against
them.

The purpose of this interrogation was to obtain vital information

about the terrorist forces and their stocks of arms and explosives.

In

these cases also the Committee found no evidence of physical brutality

or of torture or of brain-washing.

They did, however, conclude that some

of the procedures involved physical ill-treatment.

Full details are given in

the report.
8.

The principles applied in the interrogation of suspects in Northern

Ireland and, the methods employed are the same as those which have been
used in all struggles against armed terrorists in which Britain has been
involved in the last 20 years.

Does the Government accept the Compton Report?

A.
The Government welcome the Committee's findings that none of
those who were arrested on 9 August were subject to physical brutality
by the security forces, much less torture or brainwashing. The
Government have taken note that in a relatively small number of cases
the Committee concluded that some of those arrested suffered a
measure of physical ill-treatment.
Most of the cases in which the Committee considered some
physical ill-treatment had occurred related to the process of
interrogation, and in the light of the Committee's report, the
Government are inviting 3 Privy Counsellors to examine, and provide
authoritative advice on,the procedures for the interrogation of
persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including
their custody while subject to interrogation, and on the application
I would however emphasise what the Hoe
of those procedures.
Secretary said in his preface to the Report about the difficulty of
implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous
and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary.
As for the handful of cases where the Compton Committee thought
that people suffered ill-treatment at the time of arrest or at a
Regional Holding Centre - for example, the case of Mr. Cummings who
was hooded and bound as a military precaution -, I can only say that
it speaks volumes for the discipline and common sense of the many
soldiers who were engaged in this large-scale and dangerous operation
in which a total of 342 arrests were made that there were so very
few cases of this kind and that when they did occur, on no occasion,
in the Committee's view, was ill-treatment deliberate.
2.

Will any disciplinary action be taken in respect of any cases
where Compton concluded there had been ill-treatment?
Is the Secretary of State for Defence satisfied that this
report exonerates the Army?

A.
As was indicated in paragraph 18 of the Home Secretary's
preface to the Compton Report, the Government do not regard the

Committee's findings as in any way reflecting adversely on the
responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in
Northern Ireland are conducting their fight against a vicious and
ruthless enemy. So far as the military forces for which HMG are
responsible are concerned the repo t does not appear to indicate
any circumstances in which disciplinary action would be appropriate.
It is worth pointing out that it was only in the case of 19
persons out of a total of 342 arrested that the Compton Committee
found any evidence of physical ill-treatment and that in 8 of those
cases - those which were concerned ith the handling of suspects at
the time of arrest and at Regional Holding Centres - such illtreatment as there was could in no way be regarded as deliberate or
as part of the routine for handling prisoners. These are remarkably

Did Ministers know precisely what methods of interrogation

For this reason Ministers could not know in precise detail what
course interrogation would take, but we were fully confident that
those responsible for carrying out the interrogation of suspects
would observe the rules governing the conduct of interrogation - rules

A number of complaints were made that those arrested were

The Compton Committee looked into
all these and either discounted them or were unable to reach a
conclusion because of a conflict of evidence.
There is nothing I can
usefully add to their findings.
40.

Why no medical check on entry to Girdwood?

A.

Because of an unavoidable last minute change of plan medical

cover at the Holding Centre had to be provided by two Regimental
Medical officers who were also responsible for treating injured

soldiers from their units and civilian casualties in the vicinity.
The demands on them were such that they could not be at the Holding
Centre all the time and they were therefore unable to examine each
arrested person as he arrived.
However, there was a medical orderly
there all the time and one or other of the RMOs was on call at 30
minutest notice.
In fact a number of arrested persons at Girdwood
Park who either asked for treatment or clearly needed it were treated
by the RMOs.
41.

What about alle g ations that in several cases the Army arrested
the wrong men or seized relatives if they could not get the

person they wanted?
A.
In an operation of the kind that was carried out on 9 August
there were bound to be some cases of mistaken identity. More often
than not these could not be sorted out on the snot but once it was
established that an arrested man was not the person who was wanted
he was released.
I am not aware of any cases where it has been shown that troops
arrested people who were not wanted simply because they could not
find the person they were looking for.

His Honour Edgar Fay, QC, and Dr Ronald Gibson, CBE,
as members, with the following terms of reference:""To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9 August

The Committee of Inquiry visited Northern Ireland from

The Situation in Northern Ireland
3.

In considering the Committees report it is important to

have in mind the circumstances in Northern Ireland in which the
Northern Ireland Government decided to exercise their powers under

the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 to
arrest, detain or intern persons suspected of having acted or being

about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace
or the maintenance of order.
4.

At the beginning of February this year the IRA began to increase

the ferocity of their well-established campaign of violence.

A marked

increase in intensity occurred in July, and has been maintained up to the
present time.

This campaign of murder and intimidation has included

gun attacks on military and police patrols, explosive attacks on offices
and buildings, together with indiscriminate bombing of occupied buildings
in the cities, killing and injuring members of the general public.

Introduction of Internment

The preservation of law and order in Northern Ireland is primarily

the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government.

By July and early

August the deterioration in the situation in Northern Ireland had reached
the point where they felt it necessary, with the agreement of Her Majesty's
Government, to resort to their powers of internment.

In announcing the decision to introduce internment on 9 August

1971 the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,

Allegations of Physical Brutality

A number of allegations were made about the treatment of those

who were arrested on 9 August.

I thought it right that these allegations

should be investigated by an impartial inquiry; and it was for this reason
that I appointed the Committee whose report has now been presented to me.

The Committee's Findings
12.

I asked the Committee to adopt procedures which were designed to

protect the lives of those who had conducted the arrests and interrogations
against the risk of retaliation.

Nevertheless, every individual who

believed that he had grounds of complaint had the opportunity to put
his case forward and was assured of a full and impartial hearing.
It is significant that so many of those concerned failed to take this
opportunity.

The Committee carried out a thorough examination

of the evidence, both oral and documentary, put forward by members
of the security forces.

In the great majority of cases they set against

it nothing more than unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations which

is all that they had before them.

In many cases the Committee themselves

have felt unable to carry the matter any further;

but in the Government's

view the balance of credibility is clear.
13.

The allegations which the Committee have examined fall broadly

into two classes, those relating to the initial arrests and a small number
concerned with the subsequent process of interrogation.

As regards the

former category it emerges from the report that both the number and the
nature of the complaints which in the Committee's view had, or may have
had, some substance are very limited.

Indeed, the record of events

reflects great credit on the security forces, who carried out a difficult

These rules are summarised in the Government's evidence to

the Committee (paragraph 46) which also points out that:

information

must be sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as
quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons, arms and
explosives,

forces and of the civil population"".
15.

In the present circumstances of Northern Ireland, as described in

paragraphs 3-5 of this note, it is imperative to obtain all available
intelligence in order to save the lives of civilians and members of the
security forces;

and it is therefore essential to interrogate suspects who

are believed to have essential information.

The principles applied in the

interrogation of suspects in Northern Ireland since August this year, and
the methods employed (which are necessary not only for reasons of control
but also to protect the lives of those being interrogated against the risk of
reprisals), are essentially the same as those which have been employed in
all emergencies of this kind in which Britain has been involved in recent
years.

report, were issued in 1965 and were revised in 1967 in the light of

16.

The Government reject any suggestion that the methods currently

authorised for interrogation contain any element of cruelty or brutality.
The report of the Committee confirms this view.

But it also brings out

the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which

rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary.
The Government have therefore decided that it would be right to set up
machinery for examining and providing authoritative advice upon the
procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement
in a terrorist campaign,

including their custody while subject to

interrogation, and the application of those procedures,
17.

The Government are grateful for the care and thoroughness

with which the members of the Committee of Inquiry carried out their
difficult task.

The main strain of protecting the population in Northern

Ireland falls upon the Armed Forces and the RUC.

It is clear from the

Committee's report, and from personal observation by a large number of
responsible witnesses from all walks of life, that the security forces have
discharged their onerons duties with the utmost

restraint.

Despite

provocations of which the Press and other public media give us daily
evidence,

those responsible for arrests have carried out their duties

with a high regard for humanitarian principles.

The Government do

not regard the findings of the Committee as in any way reflecting adversely
on the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in

THE ARREST OPERATION ON 9 AUGUST 1971
29.

As explained to us, the overriding requirement that governed the planning

and execution of this operation was that complete security should be maintained
about the identity of the persons to be arrested and the date and time when
the arrests were to be carried out.

We understand that the authorities

accepted that in consequence of this security requirement, the operation would
be carried out with a considerable element of local improvisation and might
be attended by some administrative confusion, but that they considered this
to be the

lesser evil in relation to the paramount need to maintain security

and achieve surprise.

30.

A factor that added to the element of improvisation in one particular

area was the decision, taken late on 7 August, not to locate the Belfast
Regional Holding Centre in Crumlin Jail itself as had been planned up to that
date but to set up theHolding Centre in the adjacent Girdwood Park Territorial
Army Centre.

We have no doubt that some of the defects in the arrangements at

Girdwood, which we notice later in this Report, are to beattributed to this
last minute change of plan.
31.

The operation consisted of five phases as follows:-

1.

The arrests

32.

Parties of soldiers effected arrests according to lists prepared by the

Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch.

Very occasionally RUC officers acted

as guides but in all cases the arresting was done by the military.

Speed was

the prime consideration to avoid the chance of hostile crowds gathering even at
that early hour.

Each arrester completed a report relating to the person he

arrested.

33.

The arrests took place at 0430, or as near to that time as possible, on

Monday 9 August.

Each soldier making an arrest was instructed to say:

""I am arresting you under the powers conferred by the Civil Authorities
(Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922""
and to add, if a person questioned the arrest in any way, no more than:
""I am not required to give any further explanation.

I warn you that

if you resist arrest you may have committed an offence""

",4 the arrest operation on 9 august 1971 29  as explained to us the overriding requirement that governed the planning  and execution of this operation was that complete security should be maintained about the identity of the persons to be arrested and the date and time when the arrests were to be carried out  we understand that the authorities  accepted that in consequence of this security requirement the operation would be carried out with a considerable element of local improvisation and might be attended by some administrative confusion but that they considered this to be the  lesser evil in relation to the paramount need to maintain security  and achieve surprise  30  a factor that added to the element of improvisation in one particular  area was the decision taken late on 7 august not to locate the belfast regional holding centre in crumlin jail itself as had been planned up to that date but to set up theholding centre in the adjacent girdwood park territorial army centre  we have no doubt that some of the defects in the arrangements at  girdwood which we notice later in this report are to beattributed to this last minute change of plan 31  the operation consisted of five phases as follows  1  the arrests  32  parties of soldiers effected arrests according to lists prepared by the  royal ulster constabulary special branch  very occasionally ruc officers acted  as guides but in all cases the arresting was done by the military  speed was  the prime consideration to avoid the chance of hostile crowds gathering even at that early hour  each arrester completed a report relating to the person he  arrested  33  the arrests took place at 0430 or as near to that time as possible on  monday 9 august  each soldier making an arrest was instructed to say  i am arresting you under the powers conferred by the civil authorities special powers act northern ireland 1922 and to add if a person questioned the arrest in any way no more than i am not required to give any further explanation  i warn you that  if you resist arrest you may have committed an offence

Violence to life and person, in

The precise application of these general rules in particular
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment
on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in
question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against
terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding
their operations, their dispositions, and their plans. When combating
a terrorist campaign time is of the essence; information must be
sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as quickly as

thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the

civil population.
4.

Information can be obtained more rapidly if the person being

interrogated is subjected to strict discipline and isolation, with
a restricted diet; but violence or humiliating treatment, as
explained above, are forbidden. Equally any person undergoing

interrogation must be assured of security against either violent
treatment by his fellow detainees or recognition by them; the
evidence of IRA vengeance against informers underlines the importance
of this safeguard.""
47.

The evidence we received from the officials we interviewed about the

application of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum we
reproduce above can be summarised as follows.
The objectives mentioned in the memorandum may involve the use of the

had just served four nionths of a
six-month term for wearing a
military-style uniform at a Republican funeral. As soon as Icaie
out I was picked up by Brtish
troops and Special Branbh men.
They told me I was to be interned
under the Special Powers Act. They
drove me to the camp at Howood
just outside Belfast.
I was held at this interrogation
centre for.26 hours, during which
time I was subjected to physical
assaults by soldiers and 1UC
Special Branch men. In an effort
to extract information from me,
one soldier squeezed my
genitals with his hand
What happened on that occasion

was that a soldier grabbed McAllister's testicles as he was being

questioned by an RUC Special
Branch man. If a reply was found
unsatisfactory, the Special Branch
man would nod to the soldier, and
the soldier would squeeze.
McAllister also spoke of a soldierI
banging a fire extinguisher down
on his foot, another tutting prisoners with his head or kneeing
them in the groin, and another
saying ""Why don't you make a
break for it'? "" while waving his
sten gun.
The interrogators,
McAllister claimed, were both RUC

a""e

men and soldiers.
The lead story in yesterday's
Daily Express claimed that MeAllister's condition was the result
of his having been beaten up by
fellow IRA members- as a punishment for informing. ""The idea

Express, ""was that at a welld

1992,IMG_5231_PREM_15_485,"The Sunday Times allegations are covered
by the terms of reference of
Sir Edmund Compton's inquiry; indeed, the
terms of reference were specially
framed for this purpose.
(See letter of 31st August to Sir Edmund Compton of
which Mr. Wilson can, if necessary, be given a copy).
They read as follows:""To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August under the
Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of
physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior
to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal
charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order"".
Allegations of the kind quoted in the Sunday Times have been brought to
the notice of the Compton Inquiry, who have already carried out an investigation and will include the results in their forthcoming report.

Six weeks ago

the Inquiry asked the Sunday Times and other newspapers to furnish them with
any evidence in their possession.

They have accordingly taken note of the

offer by the Editor of the Sunday Times, which has now, at last, been made,
to furnish them with the full material on which yesterday's report was based.
As soon as this material is supplied to them, they will extend their Inquiry to
deal with any matters which were not covered by the investigations which they
have already made.

If so, however, their report (which might otherwise be

available early in November) may be a little delayed.
When the report is available, it will be published, subject to whatever
amendment or omission is required for security reasons.

At that stage the
on the

Government would be prepared to inform the Leader of the Opposition,

normal Privy Counsellor basis, of the amendments or omissions which had
been made.
Until the report is published the whole matter is, in a sense,
judice;

sub

and it would therefore be both premature and improper for the

Government to comment publicly on allegations which have appeared in

the Press.

But they are prepared to tell Mr. Wilson - again, on a Privy

Counsellor basis - that the methods of interrogation which Ministers authorised
in Northern Ireland are the same in principle as those which were employed in
similar circumstances of organised terrorism - e. g. in Malaysia, Cyprus and
Aden - and were last reviewed in 1967 in the light of the Bowen report on the
Aden episode.

As in all cases of this kind, it is naturally impossible to be
-

sure that in the heat of the moment there may not have been some over

severity in applying some of these accepted techniques in Northern Ireland.
For further enlightenment on this point, we shall have to await the Compton
report.

2017,IMG_5256_PREM_15_474,"STORMONT DEBATE ON ""LAW AND ORDER"" MOTION
10. The motion, reported in last week's HONIP, paragraph 5, signed
by 14 back-bench Unionist MPs, led by Mr. Joseph Burns and including
Sir Robert Porter, was debated in the House of Commons at Stormont
on 27
January. The motion expressed complete support for the
Government in bringing in ""watever measures, however rigorous"".
An amendment to this motion was signed by Mr. Craig, Mr. West,
Mr. Boal, Mr. Paisley, Mr. Beattie, Mr. Laird and Mr. McQuade.
Only Mr. Laird, who was elected to the House last November
(see HONIP(70) 47, paragraph 6) is a member of the Unionist
Parliamentary Party. This motion accused the Government of
consistently failing to deal with the origins of subversion in the
community. The speeches were largely predictable, although
Mr. Boal's rejection of the use of internment (since it would
strengthen what he described as the ""weak, stupid and cowardly
executive""), was unusual for its method of approach, though not
its target. The motion without the Craig-West amendment was
carried by 29 votes to 7. While this undoubtedly represents a
parliamentary victory for Major Chichester-Clark albeit a not
unexpected one, it is clear that at least some of the signatories
to the motion saw it as an opportunity to put pressure on the
Government to take yet tougher action against rioters. In his
speech introducing the motion Mr. Burns had called for internment
and the use of firearms in controlling disturbances.
MEETING OF THE ULSTER UNIONIST COUNCIL
January it was announced that a special meeting of the
11. On 25
Council had been requisitioned by 170 of the 980 members of the
Council, who wished it to consider a resolution calling for the
resignation of the Government because of its failure to maintain
law and order. Prominent among the signatures are those of
Mr. Craig, former Minister for Home Affairs, and Mr. West,
President of the West Ulster Unionist Council. It had been known
for some time that Right-Wing critics of Major Chichester-Clark had
obtained the required number of signatures, but they were thought
to have held back from requisitioning a meeting because they were
uncertain of their ability to win a majority (see HONIP(69) 39
paragraph 10). The officers of the Council will now consider when a
meeting should take place. The annual meeting of the Council is
due in March, and, as delegates have to be summond by letters, the
postal strike may be a factor in the timing. Major Chichester-Clark
has not yet reacted to the call for a meeting, but in the past he
has said that he will continue in office so long as he has the
confidence of the Parliamentary party. Much will depend on his
ability to hold to this line, if the Unionist Council went against
him.
12. On 26
January supporters of Major Chichester-Clark announced
that they had collected 250 signatures of Council delegates who
would back the Government.

Two further steps, however, were taken following that meeting.

and to discuss such matters as legal problems (Items 3 and 4 of the Annex)

which Ministers may like to discuss on the Ministry of Defence conclusions
are:(a)

The timeliness and adequacy of the proposed reinforcement (Item 13).

Is 15 major units enough, as well as being the ""maximum practicable""?

And

how long would it take for the troops to be there, if the order were given

tomorrow?
(b)

The study of security of frontiers (Item 15).

want to know when the study will be finished and perhaps to direct that it

MR. FAULKNER said that he had called for the surrender of weapons
and had declared an amnesty in respect of criminal prosecutions. He
had also instructed the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) to arrange for all revolver licencees to be visited
and asked to justify their need for a revolver.
There was no evidence
that arms held under licence had been used for improper purposes,
and the matter was therefore one of some political delicacy.
No new
permits had been issued for rifle clubs for some time, and he would take
an opportunity of making that fact publicly known.
Processions
MR. FAULKNER said that, although he wanted to reduce the number of
processions and remove the possibility of dangerous confrontations, he
was not proposing a general prohibition of processions.
If, however,
organisers of processions insisted on taking routes that would involve
dangerous community confrontations, he would not hesitate to prohibit a

difficulty, and measures wore in hand to deal with them.
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING confirmed that he had
sufficient resources to deal with any trouble that might arise.
Internment
MR. FAULKNER said that he would not agree to any proposal for the

use of the internment powers in the Civil Authorities (Special Powers)
Acts, unless he was advised by the Army and the police that internment
would bring IRA terrorism decisively to an end.
The General Officer
Commanding had indicated to him that he was against internment and the
Chief Constable also, although he had reported that the Special Branch
of the RUC were marginally in favour of it. - Although the use- of
internment on both sides of the Border appeared to have been a significant
factor in bringing IRA terrorism to an end in 1962, the IRAcampaign
then was of a different character to their present operation and he
himself was not in favour of internment at this juncture.

There would

be advantage in bringing in a number of suspects for questioning, but
that too would entail the use of special powers of detention which he was
anxious to avoid.
He agreed nevertheless that it would be prudent to
have plans ready, should internment have to be resorted to.
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING said that HMS Maidstone
Could be used only temporarily; a reconnaissance had been carried out,
and it was recommended that a site at Long Kesh was the most suitable

site for constructing a camp for internees.
It would take 4 or 5 months
to complete from the date on which approval to start was given.
If it
were not used for internees, it could be used for quartering soldiers.

Since 9th August persons have been detained under Orders made by
me as Civil Authority under the Special Powers Act.
Orders interning 219 of these persons.

I have now made

Other detainees have been released

on the direction of the Atto rney-General,

or their cases are still under

consideration.
In view of the widespread and proper concern over the use by the
Government of internment powers, I think it is my duty to explain fully
the considerations I have borne in mind in making Internment Orders.
We are at present engaged in a deadly struggle against an armed
conspiracy whose immediate purpose it is to destroy the peace, stability
and security of this part of the United Kingdom.
purpose.

I say the immediate

The ultimate purpose is the overthrow by violence the clear and

democratically expressed wish of the majority of the people of Northern
Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.

Neither the I.R.A., nor

indeed any other organisation, will be allowed to achieve this by force
of arms, though the present campaign of violence may have gained the support
of some,

who while professing to deplore the methods of the I.R.A., are in

sympathy with its aims.
The leaders of this campaign are using every technique available to
bypass the ordinary processes of democracy and to over-ride the wishes of

the great majority of law-abiding citizens.

The Northern Ireland Government

is fully committed to and has taken effective steps to implement the principle
of securing for the minority here the fullest possible opportunity to participate in the running of affairs within the framework of democratic government.
The danger of not taking firm measures to defeat the I.R.A. lies precisely in

Persons who may be members of the Civil Rights

or of other organisation, are being

interned only if they are also members of the I.R.A. or actively involved in
it.

Members of various organisations who have been associated in one way or

another with the I.R.A. are not included where I am not satisfied that they
are sufficiently deeply implicated and committed to violence to justify their
being interned.

Anyone in Northern Ireland is as free to express his views

as before within the limits of the law.

The only reason anyone is interned

is that he belongs to, and has actively supported, an organisation which
advocated and uses violence for political ends.

",in the fact that those who use or advocate violence destroy the prospects of peaceful cooperation in this direction let us by clear that the ira have already deprived the community in northern ireland of certain elementary rights  people in areas where  the ira is most active have been ruthlessly intimidated those areas fear daily the risk of bring struck down  people outside  a government  as the  same duty to protect its citizens from an internal enemy as it has to protect them from an external enemy in time of war and those who oppose the rights of the individual should also consider the rights of society as a whole i have exercised powers of internment with the greatest possible reluctance  a reluctance shared by all my colleagues  majestys government in london  as well  as by her  but i have made no internment order without  being satisfied on evidence placed before me that the person concerned was and still is an active member of the official or provisional wing of the ira or has been closely implicated in the recent ira now interned are over 80 officers  of the official  campaign  amongst  those  and provisional wing of the  ira political views oppose  the government  or because  persons who may be members of the civil rights  movement or the peoples democracy  or of other organisation are being  interned only if they are also members of the ira or actively involved in it  members of various organisations who have been associated in one way or  another with the ira are not included where i am not satisfied that they are sufficiently deeply implicated and committed to violence to justify their being interned  anyone in northern ireland is as free to express his views  as before within the limits of the law  the only reason anyone is interned  is that he belongs to and has actively supported an organisation which advocated and uses violence for political ends  
2350,IMG_5590_PREM_15_480,"Internment is not appropriate in the case of those people who
may have been guilty of indiscriminate or malicious violence,

and I am

satisfied that the ordinary processes of law are sufficient to deal
with the great majority of them.
Why then should the same processes of law not have their way with
members of the I.R.A.?

In many cases,

of course,

the law has caught up

with them and about 40 members of the organisation are at present serving
prison sentences, but they represent only a small proportion of membership

and further steps had to be taken.

When one is dealing with an armed

conspiracy it may be necessary to take pre-emptive action rather than wait

until those involved can be caught red-handed.

When I.R.A. groups emerge

from concealment for an attack the security forces are always in a position
to engage or capture

and if open confrontation occurs there is always,

as

an appalling risk of innocent people being injured or killed.

There comes a stage when a government cannot afford to wait until known
terrorists choose the moment to strike.

Furthermore, intimidation had made

it more and more difficult to get witnesses to give evidence against members
of the I.R.A.
longer

It was clearly intolerable that they should be able any

by this means to place themselves effectively beyond the law.
It is alleged that internment is being directed against the Catholic

section of the population.

This is simply untrue.

It is directed against

an unlawful and ruthless association, whose clear aim it is to overthrow by
force of arms the constitution and laws of Northern Ireland.
Internment involves the Catholic community only to the extent that
some, I say some, member of that community have become involved in I.R.A.
activity.

I should add the warning that so long as the present situation
prevails it will be necessary for the protection of decent people that
the present policy be pursued.

This means that the relentless pursuit

of those members of the I.R.A. still on the wanted list will continue.
The Government has introduced internment solely for the protection
of the citizens of Northern Ireland.

I hope, therefore,

that those who,

for reasons which I respect, are opposed to internment whatever the circumstances will also use their influence to bring to an end the conditions
which have made internment necessary.

freedom by the authorities down there, to operate, to train, and to move
about arms and gelignite, and therefore one is very likely to have an
increasing number of incidents along the border between Northern Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland. We had an incident last night at Clogher on
the Tyrone/Monaghan border, and we had one at Koleen, near Newry, and of

Ireland near Corfmaglen.

rather than for a situation of armed conflict such as obtained
at present.
LORD CARRINGTON agreed that this was the right
view to take of the Hunt recommendations;
he commented that
he had certainly seen no policemen who were not armed when
he visited Londonderry the previous day.
2.
The CLF explained that there were broadly speaking
three categories of police stations to be considered:
those in which the RUC and the Army both made use of the
accommodation, other large or medium sized stations, and
There
the small stations with only three or four policemen.
at present the Army
were 151 police stations altogether;
was providing protection for 72 of them, but he regarded this
as entirely a temporary arrangement which - except in the
case of the shared stations - should be ended as soon as
possible.

LORD CARRINGTON made a brief survey of the present
He was satisfied that the introduction

of internment had been a major step forward in bringing the
the task for the
poison of terrorism to the surface;
Security Forces was now one of cleaning up, which was bound
to take quite a long time but which he was sure could be
completed successfully provided that the political situation
remained reasonably stable.
In particular, internment had
increased the amount of available information about the IRA
and the Army's main task was now to follow up this intelligence
At the same time
so that terrorists were given no respite.
there were very real difficulties in providing sufficient
Army manpower for this task - and it was really out of the
question therefore to saddle the Army with widespread
As for the
commitments to provide static guards as well.
UDR, he was reluctant to use its members on guarding police
stations - partly because, so far at least, its strength was

barely adequate for its other guard duties, but mainly because
the idea that protecting police stations would be one of
the regiment's main tasks seemed likely to discourage would-be
recruits.
4.
Members of the Police Authority then made the following
points :
a.

They were strongly opposed to making the
RUC responsible for guarding its own stations
because this would aggravate the shortage of
policemen available for proper police duties.
The task of providing adequate protection at all
police stations would call for something like 1,000

Chequers, 27 and 28 September 1971

AGREED STATEMENT
During the last two days we have discussed the situation in
Northern Ireland in all its aspects.
We have done so fully recognising that each of us remains committed to his publicly stated
position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland; and we
have been concerned to see whether, without prejudice to those
positions, we can find some agreed means of enabling all the people
of Northern Ireland to live in the conditions of peace and stability
which any democracy should ensure to its citizens without regard to
their religious or political conviction.
We are at one in condemning any form of violence as an instrument
of political pressure; and it is our common purpose to seek to bring
violence, and internment and all other emergency measures to an end
without delay.
We also recognise that to bring violence quickly to an end and to
resume economic, social and cultural progress means must be found to
establish harmony and co-operation between the two communities in
Our discussions in the last two days have helped to
Northern Ireland.
create an atmosphere of greater understanding between us and it is our
hope that the process of political reconciliation may go forward to a
successful outcome.
We agree that our meeting has served a significant and useful
purpose in present circumstances, and we believe that further such
meetings may have a helpful part to play in the future.

Mr. Heath and Mr. Lynch agreed to keep in close communication with
each other, personally, through their ministerial colleagues and at
official level, as might be appropriate, on all subjects affecting the
future of Anglo-Irish relations.
In this respect the meeting between
the two Prime Ministers scheduled for the autumn to discuss a range of
subjects, including the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the
applications of both countries for membership of the European Communities will be held on dates to be announced later.

Next, agree that the issues for discussion can perhaps
best be grouped
under three heads:A.

The scope and nature of further reforms - both constitutional and
administrative - in Northern Ireland.

B.

The problem of security and public order.

C.

Internment.

(This is put separately, and last, partly because

it is

in a sense the most difficult issue and partly because it bridges A
and B,

which are therefore beat discussed first).

A.

Further Reforms in

(1)

Agree on the objective

Northern Ireland
i.e. the need to ensure the minority

communities 'an active, permanent and guaranteed role in the life and
public affairs of the Province"".
(2)

Agree that this entails both changes at Stormont and changes In

administrative practice ""on the ground""; and that these are the agenda
for the Home Secretary's discussions.
(3)

Invite Mr. Faulkner to say what he is prepared to offer under both

heads.
I have emphasised to Sir Harold Black:(1)

That Mr. Faulkner should come prepared to be as explicit and
detailed in this respect as Mr. Lynch wishes and that his proposals
for administrative change - particularly as regards public
appointments. etc.

-

may be particularly relevant.

(ii) That the Green Paper is not to be published without our prior
acquiescence in the timing of publication.
(4)

Invite Mr.

Lynch to comment.

If the Northern Ireland proposals

are not enough, what more does he want?

He will probably say that:-

(i) He wants to get rid of Stormont altogether and to substitute a system
of government by Commission in which the two communities will be
represented equally on a 50:50 basis.

Both we and Mr. Faulkner

will probably have to reply that this would notbedemocratic and
that any system of Parliamentary democracy must operate on the
basis that the will of the majority must prevail.

To which

Mr. Lynch will say that Ulster Is a unique problem, which
requires unique treatment.

At this point there may be deadlock.

But it may be possible to restore movement by getting Mr. Faulkner
to discuss the possibility of introducing sone Roman Catholics into
his Cabinet provided that they are ""sound"" on the basic constitutional
issue, i.e. provided that they are not Republicans.

2467,IMG_5707_PREM_15_481,"Mr.

Faulkner may also wish to discuss the ""localisation"" ofthe UDR
(see Annex I of the brief) and the provision of armed guards at police
stations (on which the Home Office are preparing a separate brief).
Both of these points are for separate discussion with Mr. Faulkner,
not for the tripartite meeting.

C.

Internment

This may be the most difficult part of the discussion, since it
represente the issue where Mr. Faulkner can least

afford to give ground

but Mr. Lynch may be most concerned to extract some concession as his

price for supporting the Horne Secretary's

discussions (if he is otherwise

prepared todo so).
Begin by tryingto get agreement that no democratic government can
afford to give way to violence and that, if violence escalates to a certain pitch,
there may be no alternative to some kind of internment policy.
Then, try to get Mr. Faulkner to justify the way in which internment
has been carried out and the treatment which has been given to the internees.
(Some reference to the conditions at Long Kesh; the Red Cross inspection;
the derogation under the European Convention on Human Rights, etc
Back this up with an undertaking that the appeals procedure (due to
begin on Saturday) will be conducted as rapidly as possible and will embrace
all internees, whether they appeal or not.
Play down the prospect of further internment.

(In this connection I

have told Sir Harold Black that, while we are not asking the Government of
Northern Ireland to stop pulling people in, they should keep very quiet about
the existence of a further list with as many as 200 names on it.

Typically,

he did not even know that the list existed!).
The least unprofitable outcome of thispart of the discussion would be
an undertaking by Mr. Faulkner - ? which might be publicly

quoted

that

internment will he Definitely brought to an end as soon as political stability
is restored (unless criminal charges can be preferred in the normal way).
If, in return for an undertaking of this kind, Mr. Lynch would publicly put
his weight behind

the Home Secretary's discussions, we should not have done

too badly.

IV.

By now the discussion may have reached the point at which it becomes

possible to think in terms of a statement or communique.

gave me this morning the attached draft which Mr. Faulkner may ask you to

2477,IMG_5717_PREM_15_481,"You told me that the Prime Minister might like to say something
this evening about the proposed visit to Long Kesh by the International
Red Cross.
We suggest that this might be along the lines that the
Northern Ireland Government have said that they would welcome a visit
to places of internment by the International Red Cross;
that the Foreign
and Commonwealth Secretary has conveyed this invitation to Geneva;
and
that a team from the International Red Cross is expected to visit
Northern Ireland in the near future.
We think this is likely to be
at about the end of the month.
On the question of publication of the
report of the visit, we understand that this would normally be published
subject to the agreement of the country concerned.
I understand that
in this case, Stormont rather than Westminster would be the appropriate
authority.
You may like to know for your own information that representatives
of the British Red Cross will be seeing officials at the Home Office
tomorrow for an informal meeting aimed at providing us with information
in preparation for the later visit by the International team.

On another point, we have ascertained from Northern Ireland that
the salary of the Parliamentary Commissioner is paid out of their
Consolidated Fund.
I understand that he did not receive anything from
that source until 1st April 1971 (i.e. until after he had ceased to hold
the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for the United Kingdom as a whole).

The Secretary of the Northern Ireland Detainees Enquiry telephoned
this morning to say that Sir Edmund Compton was disturbed to hear of Mr.
Thorpe's reference to him during the debate yesterday as an employee of
the Northern Ireland Government (Col. 53 of the Official Report).
Sir
Edmund has asked if a Government spokesman taking part in the debate
today could use the following form of words to rebut this damaging statement:-

""The chairman is not in the employment of either the United
Kingdom or Northern Ireland Governments.
His status as
Parliamentary Commissioner is similar to that of a judge.

The law governing his appointment ensures he is fully
independent of Government with full powers to investigate,
and if need be, criticise the actions of Government"".
I told the Secretary that I could by no means guarantee that this

form of words would be used, but I would bring them to the attention of
the Prime Minister.
We have discovered a little detail about the three internees mentioned in the ""Sunday Times"" article quoted by the Leader of the Opposition

in yesterday's debate.

I attach a note which reveals very little about

the reasons for the three men being interned but does set at rest any

anxiety about their physical condition.
I attach a note about conditions at Long Kesh which I understand you
have also asked for.
Mr. Sydney Bidwell, M.P., Mr. William Molloy, M.P. and Mr. Arthur

DRAFT STATEMENT

Political progress in Northern Ireland is bound to be impeded so long as
violence and intimidation continue;

and the purpose of internment, and of the

Army's measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever
quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability
for further political advance.
The Border is not at issue.

Nor is the constitutional position of

Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and, within this framework, the
principle of a democratically elected assembly based on universal adult
suffrage.
But the reform programme which has been and continues to be carried through
and to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom
Government arefully committed, together with increased opportunities for
participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in
Mr. Faulkner's recent initiative, have pointed the way forward.

In discussion

between the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and United Kingdom Ministers it
was agreed that it would be helpful if the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland
were to invite the Home Secretary to arrange as soon as the security situation
has sufficiently improved talks under his chairmanship with the Northern Ireland
Government, representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament
and of other representatives of the majority and minority communities.

The purpose of these discussions will be to see what agreed ways and means
can be devised, within the constitutional and democratic framework, of giving
representatives of the minority as well as of the majority community in
Northern Ireland an active

in the life and

permanent role,

the Province.

NORTHERN IRELAND:

POLITICAL SUMMARYFOR THE PERIOD
20-26 AUGUST 1971

Memorandum by the Home Office
GENERAL SITUATION
It has been a week when the possibilities of reconciliation
between the leaders of the Northern Ireland communities seem to
have become yet more remote. The parliamentary opposition
rejected Mr. Faulkner's proposal for a meeting and again turned to
Mr. Lynch for support at a meeting in Dublin. More extreme
1.

Republican groups, led by the Brady IRA, continue to pursue

parliament in opposition to the
separate plans for a nine-county
our Party's proposals. Roman Catholic
Social Democratic and
owned premises in various towns in Northern Ireland have been
shut down as a protest against Government policies and the
Roman Catholic community seem now to be responding to the call to
withhold rent. There continues to be little street activity but
the incidence of explosions has been at least as high as before
internment was introduced.

2.

In London the Government refused an official request from the

Opposition to recall Parliament, although it was made clear that
the possibility was being kept in mind. Mr. Wilson's statement

on 26th August about government policy in Northern Ireland seemed
to call into question the continuance of a bi-partisan approach at
Westminster. Mr. Heath met a delegation on 5th August led by
the Lord Mayor of Belfast, which Opposition councillors had
declined to join.
SECURITY SITUATION

3.
There have been about 20 reported explosions in Northern
Ireland during the past week, of which all but three took place
in Belfast. The most serious occurred on 25th August when about
201bs. of explosives detonated in occupied offices of the
Electricity Board in South Belfast. One man was killed and 30
other people were taken to hospital, 16 of whom were detained.
The incident led to widespread condemnation for its perpetrators,
including messages from the Prime Minister, Mr. Faulkner and
Cardinal Conway. It came at the end of a week of bomb explosions
in Belfast which injured three people at a car showrooms on
20th August and two prison officers and two prisoners on 22nd August
when a bomb exploded in the gateway of Belfast's Crumlin Road Jail.
Other targets included a Government office, a water board office,
a college, a bar, a petrol station and a number of commercial
premises. Elsewhere in Northern Ireland a telephone exchange was

POLITICAL SITUATION

It was announced on 21st August that the Government had
8.
agreed to a request from the GOC, Northern Ireland, to introduce
an independent inquiry to investigate the evidence relevant to
allegations made by those arrested under the Special Powers Act

on 9th August 1971 about their treatment while in the custody of
the security forces, prior to subsequent release, the serving of
a detention order or the preferral of criminal charges. The news
was fairly widely welcomed although the Social Democratic and
Labour Party MP, Mr. Paddy Devlin, stated that: ""it must be a
serious inquiry, held immediately and controlled by a competent
jury"". Mr. Joe Burns, the right wing Unionist and Junior
Government Minister, on the other hand, thought such an inquiry
unnecessary. No further details of the inquiry have yet been
announced. Most opposition groups, having given it a cautious
welcome, are clearly suspending judgement until they know more of
its details.

11. Mr. Faulkner made a further attempt on 24th August to define
his position and renew communication between himself and
opposition groups. While he reaffirmed the constitutional
position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, he
made a point of denying emphatically that internment was aimed at
repressing the Roman Catholic community and said that he would
continue to consider still further measures which would give the
parliamentary Opposition greater participation in the running of
Northern Ireland. Neither would he abandon this, he said, in the
face of ""those on the other side of the political spectrum who
cry 'betrayal' at every sign of change and progress in the
community"". He warned the Opposition against making common cause
with extremists and said he was willing to approach with them the
problem in a non-partisan manner. The Social Democratic and
Labour Party, however, announced that they were only interested
in talks involving the Westminster Government and still sought
the suspension of Stormont. Mr. Devlin M.P. accused Mr. Faulkner
of hypocrisy.

12. This response only confirmed the Social Democratic and
Labour Party's concentration on activities outside the
parliamentary framework with the aim that existing constitutional
arrangements will be brought down. All the party's MPs and all
the Nationalist MPs met Mr. Lynch in Dublin on 23rd August. The
Republican Labour M.P., Mr. Paddy Kennedy, refused the invitation,having
thrown in his lot with the Dail Ulaidh (see paragraph 13).
Details of the discussion were not revealed but it was reported
that the meeting was amicable and a brief statement said that it
had been agreed that the objective of equality of treatment for
everyone in Northern Ireland should be pursued by non-violent
political means. Mr. Lynch also acknowledged that the elected
Opposition members were the principal representative body of the
non-Unionist community.
The Northern Iroland MPs later met
members of the Irish Republic's Opposition parties, Fine Gael and
the Labour Party.

13. The statement therefore makes it clear that Mr. Lynch's
moral support for the campaign to end Stormont does not extend to
backing the proposals of the more extreme Republicans for a ninecounty Parliament (Dail Ulaidh) covering the traditional counties
of Ulster. This proposal was discussed at a meeting in the Irish
Republic in Monaghan on 21st August. Those present included

Moreover the Ambassador considers it likely that Mr. Lynch

to discuss the idea with colleagues in Dublin, probably
on Monday - which is not a Bank Holiday in Ireland.

He therefore proposes to act as soon as he can next
week, when Mr. Lynch returns to Dublin.
In our view this is
right; there is always the possibility that Mr. Lynch may
demur on the timing, and there is enough fevered speculation
as it is in Ireland without causing more by a spectacular
cross-country dash over the weekend.
But I would be grateful
for confirmation that this is acceptable.
We are assuming that the Prime Minister envisages a
working visit of a day, involving perhaps an overnight stay.

PUBLIC SECURITY
The meeting first discussed the security situation.
Internment

The Prime Minister asked Mr Faulkner for his opinion on the effect of
internment on the minority community.

MR FAULKNER said that the reaction

of the minority community was not to be judged solely by reference to the
violence that had accompanied the arrests, part of which was attributable
to earlier events.

Many members of the minority community would be

relieved at the removal of IRA terrorists from their midst.

The arrests

had brought a dramatic reduction in the number of attacks on property by
explosives, and the IRA in Belfast were, temporarily at any rate, seriously
disorganised.

The Border

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that any reduction in the intensity
of terrorist activity in the towns would enable the Army to give greater
attention to the Border;

and he had instructed the General Officer Commanding

(GOC), Northern Ireland, to review the studies h

had previously

ade

on the protection of the Border with particular attention to the possibility
of making unapproved roads impassable.

MR FAULKNER agreed it was important to consider how greater attention could
be given to the Border.

No co-operation had been forthcoming, according

to his information, from the regular army or police of the Irish Republic.
He asked what progress had been made over considering the possibility of
constituting a full-time unit of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).
UDR
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, while a full-time unit of the
UDR (which would require legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament) would
bring some military advantage and relieve pressure on the regular Army, the
Opposition at Westminster had set their face against it and it was strongly

opposed by the minority in Northern Ireland.

The apprehensions of its

possible misuse at some future time was irrational, but to press forward

2632,IMG_5872_PREM_15_479,"with the formation of a full-time unit in the face of these apprehensions
would endanger support for the UDR in its present form.
The United Kingdom
Government were, therefore, at present inclined against the proposal.
Complaints of Ill-treatment

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if support for the policies of the 2 Governments
over internment was to be sustained in Great Britain, it was necessary to
find a means to refute mischievous

suggestions of deliberate brutality on

the part of the security forces.

Merely to rely on the undertaking of the

GOC that any allegations substantiated by evidence would be investigated was
ceasing to be a tenable position.

A formal inquiry was inappropriate, but

the suggestion, put forward in a leading article in ""The Guardian"" that
day, that a lawyer and a doctor from Great Britain should carry out an
informal investigation of complaints had much to commend it.

There might

also be advantage if some independent observers were invited to inspect the
internment camp now approaching completion at Long Kesh before it was
occupied.

It was also important that prompt action should be taken to set

up the advisory committee for hearing representations against internment
orders.

MR FAULKNER said that the complaints of brutality tended to centre on the
action of the security forces in making the initial arrests and on the
treatment of detainees in the Army's temporary holding camps.

He supported

the suggestions for an informal investigation of complaints of ill-treatment
and for inspection of Long Kesh.

He added that there might be merit in

enabling such an organisation as Amnesty International to satisfy itself
over the justice of the proceedings of the advisory committee.

As to the

committee itself, he was in process of setting it up and had invited
Judge Brown, a Northern Ireland county court judge, to preside.

The

apparatus of the committee would not be required until internment orders
(as opposed to detention orders) had been made.

Allegations of vindictiveness
THE PRIME MINISTER said that some action should be taken to refute
suggestions that detention orders had been made out of mere political
vindictiveness:

for example by publishing a

general description of those

held in order to indicate their close involvement in terrorist activity.

",with the formation of a fulltime unit in the face of these apprehensions would endanger support for the udr in its present form the united kingdom government were therefore at present inclined against the proposal complaints of illtreatment  the prime minister said that if support for the policies of the 2 governments over internment was to be sustained in great britain it was necessary to find a means to refute mischievous  suggestions of deliberate brutality on  the part of the security forces  merely to rely on the undertaking of the  goc that any allegations substantiated by evidence would be investigated was ceasing to be a tenable position  a formal inquiry was inappropriate but  the suggestion put forward in a leading article in the guardian that day that a lawyer and a doctor from great britain should carry out an informal investigation of complaints had much to commend it  there might  also be advantage if some independent observers were invited to inspect the internment camp now approaching completion at long kesh before it was occupied  it was also important that prompt action should be taken to set  up the advisory committee for hearing representations against internment orders  mr faulkner said that the complaints of brutality tended to centre on the action of the security forces in making the initial arrests and on the treatment of detainees in the armys temporary holding camps  he supported  the suggestions for an informal investigation of complaints of illtreatment and for inspection of long kesh  he added that there might be merit in  enabling such an organisation as amnesty international to satisfy itself over the justice of the proceedings of the advisory committee  as to the  committee itself he was in process of setting it up and had invited judge brown a northern ireland county court judge to preside  the  apparatus of the committee would not be required until internment orders as opposed to detention orders had been made  allegations of vindictiveness the prime minister said that some action should be taken to refute suggestions that detention orders had been made out of mere political vindictiveness  for example by publishing a  general description of those  held in order to indicate their close involvement in terrorist activity  
2633,IMG_5873_PREM_15_479,"MR FAULKNER said that the view of the security forces was that it would be
untimely to publish such a description, which might prejudice their chances
of success in arresting the remainder of the persons whose detention was
sought.

But he agreed that the matter should be reconsidered.

Interrogation and further Arrests

THE PRIME

MINISTER said that it was important that the momentum of

interrogation should be maintained and that the remaining persons whose
detention was sought should be arrested as soon as possible.
MR FAULKNER said that there had been a pause in the progress of
interrogation to analyse the results so far obtained, but hewould impress
the need for urgency on the Chief Constable.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,

said that the

review of the studies on the protection of the Border should be urgently
pursued by the Secretary of State for Defence.

The possibility of sending

a lawyer and a doctor to conduct informal investigations of complaints
should be urgently examined and the GOC should be consulted immediately.
It would be important to select people who could fairly distinguish between

deliberate brutality and the force that had inevitably to be used to
bring violent terrorists into custody.

The possibility of an independent

inspection of the internment camp and the independent observation of the

advisory committee system would also be pursued (although the International
Red Cross might prove to be a more suitable body than Amnesty International
for the latter purpose).

The possibility of refuting allegations of

vindictiveness in making arrests would be pursued.

Information should be

obtained on the timing of the plans for making further arrests, which,
with the interrogation of those in custody, should be carried forward
as quickly as possible.

Relations with the Irish Republic
The meeting then considered relations with the

Irish Republic.

Neil Cairncross will be circulating a full
note of thi morning's meeting with the Prime
Minister of Northern Ireland, but I thought that
in advance this
it would be useful if I sent
note of the points on whichit was agreed that
further action should be taken.

There was somediscussion of the allegations

of brutality by the Army in arresting and interrogating some of those who had been detained. Ministers
thought that there as considerable disadvantage,
from a presentational point of view, in the publication of these allegation by relatives of the
detainees without any corresponding authoritative
reaction from the Army or the Government they
simply
doubted whether it was sufficient to re
into
to
inquire
undertaking
published
on the GOC's
is given to him. On
any cases of which evidence
re would be
the other hand it was felt that

disadvantages about any formalcommittee of inquiry.
Some merit was seen in asuggestion made in The
Guardian that two responsible people say a doctor
and a lawyer, should be sent out to investigate
the allegations and see if there wasany truth in
them. If this was to be done however, the individuals concerned would have to be carefully chosen
people who could distinguish between the sort of
rough handling which was inevitable in a situation
of thiskind and deliberate and wanton brutality.

2639,IMG_5879_PREM_15_479,"It was for question whether the request to the
persons concerned should go from the GOCR or from
Government; the general view wasthat it should
go from the Government. Clearly however the GOC
should be consulted before a final decision was
taken, and the Defence Secretary was invited to
arrange for the GOC to be consulted immediately.
The Defence Secretary said that the GOC was
urgently re-examining the possibility of strengthening
the control of the border as soon as the demands
upon the security forces In Belfast and Londonderry
permitted the release of forces. He was invited
to see that these studieswent forward urgently,
and included a re-examination of the possibility
of effective action to prevent access from the
south to the north byunapproved roads.
Ministers noted that it was proposed that

there should be a second round of detentions as
soon as the information obtained from the first
ed that
detainees had been digested. It was
of action
it was desirable that this second r
should be completed as soon as possible.
Ministers discussed the objectives to be sought
from a meeting ith Mr. Lynch. T hese objectives
should probably include greater co-operation between

Republican and Northern Ireland security forces
along the border, stiffening the courts in the
Republic, and the introduction of internment in
the Republic (though it was thought thatMr.

to agree to the last of these proposals
unless the IRA began to direct its action against

2645,IMG_5885_PREM_15_479,"Current situation

The internment operation has been a considerable success technically
Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady
wings of the IRA.

The evidence is that both wings have been muchmore

seriously disrupted than statements from IRA sources suggest, and while
they will undoubtedly continue to give trouble, there is reasonable hope
that, with increased vigilance at the border, terrorist activity wi11

now

be at a lower level than in the weeks before internment.

2.

But internment is only a means to an end:

and the political and

social consequences have been serious - more serious than many people Is
Northern Ireland expected.

It is too soon to reach conclusionsabout the

permanence of public reaction, but there has undoubtedly been a greater
polarisation between the two communities.

3.

The reaction on the part of the minority to the decision to ban the

marches, starting with the Apprentice Boys, has been disappointing.

We

have not done well in the propaganda battle, and the impression has bees
widely given that the Army's role has changed and that it is now

there to

maintain the dominance of the Unionist majority and to concentrate its
attentions on the Roman Catholic minority.
4.

The morale of moderate Roan Catholics is low and many of those who

have been giving service to public bodies are wondering whether they can
carry on.

So far, there has been little response to the civil rights call

for strikes, except in Londonderry, and the trade union leadership is
trying to counter it.

But it will be touch and go;

The special task which the Prime Minister has asked me to undertake is to
seek out the various elements of thought in the Catholic community in regard
to the present crisis and, insofar as I can interpret them, to convey them to
him and to the Cabinet as a whole.
It goes without saying that this is a role which I cannot adequately discharge
without substantial support and goodwill from the community, and particularly,
a measurable degree of sympathy and understanding from my Catholic fellow
citizens.

I hope I will have that.

Naturally enough, people will want to know where I stand in relation to
issues about which there is considerable controversy.

There are one or two

such issues upon which I would like to make my position clear immediately.
First of all, internment.

If I had been a member of the Cabinet when this

matter was under discussion, I would undoubtedly have been opposed to it.
Now that it is an accomplished fact, I think the important thing is to create
as soon as possible the circumstances in which it can rapidly be ended, and
in the meantime to ensure that what is inevitably a distasteful business is
conducted with fairness and humanity.

The Prime Minister has emphasised to me

that the Advisory Committee, on which an eminent English lawyer and a local
businessman serve with Judge Brown, is able to review all cases, and that he
has publicly stated that it would be quite extraordinary if he were not to
accept this advice.

He has, in fact, released every internee whose release

the Committee has recommended.

I now want to make clear my views on the constitutional issue.

I accept

without reservation the position as established by the Ireland Act of 1949
that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland can only be sustained or
changed by democratic methods and with majority consent.

This proposition

seems to me to be based both on morality and on commonsense.

It also seems to

me indisputable that, at this point in time, a majority wish to retain the
constitutional link with Great Britain, and this being so I do not believe
that active discussion of imminent change is realistic or profitable.

However,

I believe strongly that citizens here have the right by all legitimate peaceful
and democratic means to advocateand to work for the ultimate unification of
Ireland, if that is their aspiration;
that he also affirms that right.

However,

I believe strongly that citizens here have the right by all legitimate peaceful

",to this objective as an informed christian i am guided by the social teachings of my church rather than upon the arguments of political or social theorists in my daily approach to relationships with my neighbour and community the special task which the prime minister has asked me to undertake is to seek out the various elements of thought in the catholic community in regard to the present crisis and insofar as i can interpret them to convey them to him and to the cabinet as a whole it goes without saying that this is a role which i cannot adequately discharge without substantial support and goodwill from the community and particularly a measurable degree of sympathy and understanding from my catholic fellow citizens  i hope i will have that  naturally enough people will rant to know where i stand in relation to issues about which there is considerable controversy  there are one or two  such issues upon which i would like to make my position clear immediately first of all internment matter was under discussion  if i had been a member of the cabinet when this i would undoubtedly have been opposed to it  now that it is an accomplished fact i think the important thing is to create as soon as possible the circumstances in which it can rapidly be ended and in the meantime to ensure that what is inevitably a distasteful business is  conducted with fairness and humanity that the advisory committee  the prime minister has emphasised to me  on which an eminent english lawyer and a local  businessman serve with judge brown  is able to review all cases  and that he  has publicly stated that itwould be quite extraordinary if he were not to accept this advice  he has in fact released every internee whose release  the committee has recommended i now want to make clear my views on the constitutional issue  i accept  without reservation the position as established by the ireland act of 1949 that the constitutional  status of northern ireland can only be sustained or  changed by democratic methods and with majority consent  this proposition  seems to me to be based both on morality and on commonsense  it also seems to  me indisputable that at this point in time a majority wish to retain the constitutional link with great britain and this being so i do not believe that active discussion of imminent change is realistic or profitable  however  i believe strongly that citizens here have the right by all legitimate peaceful and democratic means to advocate and to work for the ultimate unification of ireland if that is their aspiration that he also affirms  that right  and the prime minister has assured me

If asked by the Press whether HMG has made any plans for the
introduction of direct rule, the line to be taken will be that the
Government undertakes planning on a contingency basis for a number
of possible events: indeed we should be vulnerable to criticism if
we did not have standby plans.

But this does not mean that the events

will happen.
Review of internees
In the event a statement was not issued on Friday of last week

8.

about the number of cases of internees examined by Judge Brown's
review body but it is expected that the figures will be available today.
They are expected to show that 110 cases have been reviewed and 10
internees have been recommended for release.
Some of the cases are taking a long time to prepare.

9.

The review

body will meet as often as is necessary to avoid a backlog of prepared
cases.

At the moment they are planning to hold hearings three days a

fortnight: the rest of the time between hearings is taken up with

preparations for the hearings.

It is possible that the review body

will want to issue a statement at the end of each hearing rather
than once a week as had been originally proposed.
In order to complete the picture of the review body's activities the

10.

Home Office will in future let interested departments, including No 10,
have figures for the number of cases submitted to the review body.
BBC Programme
1l.

The BBC are planning to broadcast a discussion on the Talkback

programme on whether their reporting of events in Northern Ireland is

biased.

They have asked the Ministry of Defence whether an Army

spokesman could take part in the programme.

It has been agreed that this

would be highly undesirable and that the BBC's request should be turned
down.

Ever since the eruption into violence of the Civil

Rights movement in 1969 opened the eyes of the British

public to the condition of Ulster during the last 50 years,
successive British governments have approached its problems
on the following basis:-

(i) The constitutional position of Ulster as part of
the UK is not to be changed

(ii) The Border (Partition) is not in dispute.
(iii) Points (i) and (ii) stand until Stormont decides
otherwise (i.e. votes for re-unification).
(iv) A programme of reform must right the wrongs
suffered by the Catholic minorities in Ulster.
(v) Catholic political and public figures must be
enabled and encouraged to play a full role in the
public life of Ulster.

(vi) In the face of violence from whatever quarter law
and order have to be restored, even at the cost of
a massive deployment of the British Army and the
introduction of internment without trial.
(vii) Finally the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic
has been brought into consultation on Northern
Ireland affairs, first bilaterally with Mr. Heath
and then with Mr. Faulkner also participating.

2.

The position of the only other sovereign state involved,

namely the Republic of Ireland, upon these issues is, at
the time of writing, as follows:-

RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE HIGH COURT. AT THE BEGINNING OF

SIT IN PUBLIC, THAT THE DEFENDENTS SHOULD BE LEGALLY
REPRESENTED IN COURT AND A CROSS EXAMINATION SHOULD BE
ALLOWED. I TOLD HIM THAT I COULD HOLD OUT NO PROSPECT OF
THE PRESENT ARRANGEMNENTS BEING CHANGED BUT THAT I WAS
PREPARED TO DISCUSS HIS IDEAS ON A THEORETICAL BASIS.
TO BEGIN WITH A TRIAL IN OPEN COURT AND A CROSS EXAMINATION
OF WITNESSES BY LAWYERS WAS IN MY OPINION QUITE OUT OF
THE QUESTION. I SAID I THOUGHT I NEED HARDLY EXPLAIN IN
DETAIL WHY THIS WAS SO. MIGHT IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE

HOWEVER IF IN ADDITION TO THE JUDGES, TWO OBSERVERS SHOULD
BE PRESENT, CHOSEN WITH THE APPROVAL OF MINORITY
REPRESENTATIVES. I ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF
PERSONAL THREAT IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD THING TO CHOOSE

THESE OBSERVERS FROM PEOPLE IN THE PROVINCE , BUT IT MIGHT
PERHAPS BE POSSIBLE TO FIND

ACCEPTABLE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN.

HUME SHOWED SOME INTEREST IN THIS IDEA (WHICH I TOLD HIM
HAD OCCURRED TO ME ONLY SINCE WE HAD SPOKEN ON THE
TELEPHONE THE DAY BEFORE) AND I THOUGHT THAT HIS INSISTENCE
ON TRIAL IN OPEN COURT WITH CROSS EXAMINATION WEAKENED
IN THE LIGHT OF IT. I SAID THAT WHILE I WAS VERY HAPPY TO
TALK WITH HIM, HUME WOULD DO MUCH BETTER TO TALK WITH THE
HOME SECRETARY. I BELIEVED THAT IF HE DID SO THERE WOULD BE
NO OBJECTION TO INTERNMENT BEING THE FIRST ITEM ON THE
AGENDA, OR INDEED THE ONLY ONE, ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT FIND THAT
IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PASS ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS AS WELL.
FOR OUR PART, SUCH A MEETING COULD BE ENTIRELY PRIVATE
AND WE WOULD DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT NEWS OF IT DID NOT
GET OUT. HUME SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, AND
WONDERED WHETHER, IF A MEETING COULD BE ARRANGED, IT
WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO COME ALONE OR WITH HIS

THOUHGHT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR A FIRST

MAKE UP HIS MIND WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS COLLEAGUES. HE WOULD

It seems

that at one of the detention centres the procedure was

not carried out correctly.

The original arrest is under

Regulation 10 of the Special Powers Act.

After 48 hours

the man has to be re-arrested under Regulation 11(i) so
that he can be detained.

It seems that the 98 people at

this particular centre were not told that they were being
re-arrested under Regulation 11(i).

It does not, however, follow that the procedure applied
in the case of Mr. McElduff has to be applied in the case
of the other 97.

Because he was known to be bringing this

case, he was not interned but was kept in detention.

The

other 97 have, however, since been interned and the Northern
Ireland Government have been advised by their lawyers that
the internment cancels out any defect in the arresting
procedure at the time of detention.

Dear Joe
I am sorry I have not had an opportunity before now to
reply to your letter of 24 September.
I can confirm
that the next of kin of every single person detained was
informed at the time when the Detention Order was made.
The next of kin were also informed of the establishment
where the detainees were being held.
When the Internment Orders were signed no
additional
information was conveyed to the next of kin although the
internees themselves were given a copy of the Interment
Order.
In the event of the transfer of any internee from
one centre to another the next of kin are advised
immediately.
I can also confirm that Judge Brown's Committee intend to
consider all cases of internees whether or not
representations have been made.
In this connection I
should add that the Committee will be drawing up a
priority list and those people who have neither requested
their case to be reviewed nor have had representations
made on their behalf will be dealt with last.

They noted that Mr Faulkner was unwilling to meet the emergency

by seeking to form a Government which was neutral on the matter of
reunification, but attached value to Mr Faulkner's proposed appointment
of a Cabinet Minister or Ministers who would be widely regarded as
representative

of responsible minority opinion.

As regards the proposed

Green Paper, the British Government were still anxious that publication,
to obtain the maximum impact, should be carefully timed in relation to
other political moves,

and would not wish at this time to agree on a

specific date for publication, but they agreed that the announcement of the
other decisions to be taken at the meeting would provide a good opportunity
for Mr Faulkner to obtain the concurrence of his Cabinet colleagues in the
terms of the Green Paper.

INTERNMENT

The Meeting then discussed internment and related matters.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, from the point of view of public and
Parliamentary opinion in Great Britain, there was an urgent need for
reassurance that internment was fully justified for all those being held;
it had been alleged that some people had been interned to pay off old

political scores.

It was, therefore, important that the Advisory Council

should be seen to be working rapidly and justly, with the internees being
allowed all proper facilities for legal representation and access to
relevant documents.

It appeared that the internment camp at Long Kesh would

have to be expanded and it was important that plans should be put into

effect speedily for both the building and the manning of the extension.
The Home Secretary might be able to secure volunteers from members or former
members of the prison service in England for duty in Northern Ireland
prisons to release Northern Ireland prison officers for duty at Long Kesh,
but a significant financial inducement was likely to be necessary.

Lastly,

while the processes in connection with internment should be seen to be
working speedily and justly, an effort should be made to shorten the
interval between the arrest and trial of persons charged with criminal
offences in connection with public security.

If the public could see that

their achievements in this regard had been

but they were dimmed by the absence of a swift and manifest

outcome of their efforts.

MR FUALKNER said that he had personally examined the police recommendations
in all internment orders submitted to him.

Orders had been made only in

respect of people actively engaged in terrorism, and he had in fact
refused to make orders in a few cases.

The Advisory Committee had already

held 4 meetings and had considered 16 cases; 32 more cases were pending
and further meetings fixed to consider them.

He was expecting the first

batch of recommendations within the next few days.

Internees were all

given notice of their rights and were allowed legal advice in the
preparation of their cases; but legal representation was not allowed at
their appearance before the Committee, which was conducted in strict
confidence with only the members of the Committee present, each of whom was
provided with the relevant documents.

He had already stated publicly

that it would be most unusual for him not to accept a recommendation of the
Advisory Committee.

The test for an internee's fitness for release was not

so much his innocence of any association with terrorist organisations, but
whether he could be set at large without danger to the community.

Internment

should properly be regarded not so much as an alternative to trial as an
alternative to being shot in an act of terrorism.

Long Kesh at present

provided accommodation for 380 internees and would have to be extended to
accommodate 640 by the end of January.

It would be helpful if the Army

could undertake the building work on the same basis as in the original
construction, and he would discuss with the Home Secretary the possibility
of securing volunteers for the prison service from England.

As to the

trial of those accused of criminal offences, he agreed that speedy justice
was important.

Delays arose not so much over offences tried summarily

before the magistrates as over cases returned for trial by jury.

He thought

it would be advantageous if the establishment of special commissions of
assize could be considered to deal speedily with offences involving
security.

This was a reserved matter and fell to the United Kingdom

authorities.

The courts had in fact dealt firmly with a large number of

cases and he would supply details of these to assist public presentation
in Great Britain.

and the Home Secretary would be ready to enter into

duty in Northern Ireland prisons.

The Home Secretary would consider in

consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities the possibility of
setting up special commissions of assize.

Over the whole field of

internment and criminal trial the need for effective public presentation
must be constantly borne in mind.

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
MRFAULKNER stated that some 26,000 families were refusing to pay rents,
some of them under threat of intimidation.

Present legislation, which it

was expected would become law during the course of the following week,
provided for the diversion of social service payments to cover rents,

and certain other liabilities such as electricity bills.

rates

A separate Bill

provided for a legal means of taking over the functions of non-co-operating
local authorities.

The Northern Ireland Government's proposals had been

endorsed by both trade unions and employers.

THE PRIME MINISTER,

summing up a brief discussion of Mr Faulkner's statement,

said that there was some uncertainty as to the extent to which the United
Kingdom Government Departments concerned had been consulted in advance.

The legislation raised points of principle which would excite great
interest in Westminster, and it was essential for whitehall Departments
to consider in detail the text of the legislation and to be kept in the
closest touch with the way in which it was planed to implement it.

TEXT OF AGREED STATEMENT ISSUED ON 7 OCTOBER 1971
A meeting took place at 10 Downing Street today between Mr Heath,
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Mr Faulkner, Prime Minister of
Northern Ireland.
Mr Heath was accompanied by the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, the Lord President of the Council, and the Secretary of State
for Defence.

The Chief of the General Staff and the General Officer

Commanding, Northern Ireland, were also present.

The Ministers discussed all aspects of the current situation in Northern
Ireland.

They decided that meetings between the United Kingdom and

Northern Ireland governments should be held at regular and frequent intervals
at both ministerial and official level in London or Belfast.

The ministers reviewed the security situation.

The United Kingdom Government

have decided to raise the strength of the Army in Northern Ireland by three
battalions.

These extra forces will be at the tactical disposal of the GOC

to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other
things to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly
the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of
information which is coming into the Army's hands.

The ministers also discussed measures to give effect to the decision to
increase the strength of the Ulster Defence Regiment and to develop the
regiment's organization to increase the number of units and sub-units and
thereby enhance its local character.

Mr Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Parliamentary

Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Army has been assigned special

responsibility, at ministerial level, for UDR affairs and particularly for
recruitment.

He will be visiting Northern Ireland next week to confer with

the UDR Advisory Council and others concerned.
On internment, Mr Faulkner said that he expected shortly to receive the
first batch of recommendations of the advisory committee set up to consider
the cases of interned persons.

FOR MR H F T SMITH.
VISIT OF MPS TO CRUMLIN AND LONG KESH.
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OPPORTUNITY (BUT NO RELUCTANCE) FOR
TALK WITH THE MPS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN TALKS WITH THE INTERNEES:
I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO SOME MEMBERS BRIEFLY THIS MORNING
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN CRUMLIN, AND WAS ABLE TO TALK
AGAIN WITH THEM AS THEY LEFT LONG KESH. I WAS NOT PRESENT
DURING THEIR MEETINGS WITH INTERNEES, NOR AT THE FORMAL MEALS
WHICH FOLLOWED THE TWO VISITS AND I HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY
OF SPEAKING TO MEMBERS SINCE THEN.
2. THE DELEGATION HAD LONG TALKS WITH THE GOVORNER OF CRUMLIN
AND THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF LONG KESH, THE LATTER GIVING A
CONVINCING AND THOUGHTFUL PERFORMANCE. QUESTIONING RANGED
FAR WIDER THAN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INTERNEES WERE KEPT
AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT NO NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL OR MINISTER MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THESE
QUESTIONS AS THEY AROSE. THE GOVERNORS TRIED HARD, BUT WERE

INEVITABLY UNABLE TO F EEEEE GIVE SATISFACTORY ANSWERS ON SUCH
QUESTIONS AS WHO DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED LONG KESH, WHAT THE
EVENTUAL PLANS FOR IT WERE, AND WHAT FACTORS DETERMINED THE

SERVING OF INTERNMENT ORDERS. SEVERAL QUESTIONS
WERE ASKED ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO SIR EDMUND COMPTON'S ENQUIRY
AND JUDGE BROWN'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
3. THE SEVENTY INTERNEES AND FORTY DETAINEES AT CRUMLIN HAVE
ORGANISED A COMMITTEE OF THREE TO REPRESENT THEM, AND AT THE
DELEGATION'S REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE MET THEM IN THE GOVERNOR'S
OFFICE. THE COMMITTEE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT CONDITIONS IN THE
PRISON (THESE WERE STATED TO BE A MATTER BETWEEN THE INTERNEES,
THE GOVERNOR, AND THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT) AND TALKED INSTEAD
ABOUT BRUTALITY WHEN THE ORIGINAL ARRESTS WERE MADE. LATER
THE COMMITTEE, AFTER CONSULTING THEIR FELLOW INTERNEES TOLD THE
DELEGATION THAT THEY WERE NOT WELCOME IN THEIR WING OF THE
PRISON. OTHER INTERNEES VOCALLY SUPPORTED THEM. THE DELEGATION
DID NOT GO IN, BUT I GATHER THEY BELIEVE CONDITIONS THERE
TO BE GOOD, APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS MADE TO HELP FAMILIES OF
INTERNEES. INTERNEES DI D NOT GET MUCH SYMPATHY FOR THEIR
GAKBMBBBYKHSM

IW
ONE MEAL HUNGER STRIKE OR THE
THE MPS.

CHANG EEEEE CHANTING STAGED FOR

AT LONG KESH TOO THE INTERNEES PLANNED DEMONSTRATIONS
FOR THE DELEGATION: THERE WAS A PROFUSION OF POSTERS AND
FLAGS PROTESTING ABOUT CONDITIONS?, DEMANDING FREEDOM AND
CALLING FOR MR FAULKNER'S RESIGNATION: THESE WERE PRODUCED

BY A DRILLED GROUP OF INTERNEES IN EACH COMPOUND, AND WHEN
THEY VISITED THE COMPOUNDS MPS WERE QUICK TO NOTE THE
DEGREE OF INTERNAL ORGANISATION. ONE COMPOUND IN PARTICULAR
HAD A LARGE PROPORTION OF SELF CONFESSED IRA MEN SEEKING
BUT FAILING TO DOMINATE A SMALLER GROUP VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED

AS TRADE UNIONISTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS MEMBERS. MEMBERS
FOUND THE CONDITIONS AT LONG KESH GRIM AND THOUGHT INTERNEES

COMPARISON WITH AUSCHWITZ WAS NOT UNFAIR. THE PLACE WAS
CROWDED AND THE FOOD NOT VERY TASTY. THE WHOLE PLACE HAS THE
AIR OF A BUILDING SITE.

5. MEMBERS CLEARLY REALISED THAT AT BOTH PLACES THE INTERNEES

HAD PUT ON A SHOW FOR THEM. BUT I WOULD JUDGE THAT THEIR OVER
WHELMING IMPRESSION WILL BE THAT WHILE CONDITIONS IN CRUMLIN
ARE FAIRLY GOOD, IF A LITTLE CROWDED, CONDITIONS AT LONGNKESH
ARE MORE OPEN TO CRITICISM - PERHAPS SEVERE.

",rep belfast telno 74 of  5 october to home office  for mr h f t smith visit of mps to crumlin and long kesh there has been little opportunity but no reluctance for talk with the mps following their own talks with the internees i was able to talk to some members briefly this morning about their experiences in crumlin and was able to talk again with them as they left long kesh i was not present during their meetings with internees nor at the formal meals which followed the two visits and i have had no opportunity of speaking to members since then 2 the delegation had long talks with the govorner of crumlin and the deputy governor of long kesh the latter giving a convincing and thoughtful performance questioning ranged far wider than the conditions under which internees were kept and it was unfortunate that no northern ireland government official or minister made himself available to answer these questions as they arose the governors tried hard but were  inevitably unable to f eeeee give satisfactory answers on such questions as who designed and constructed long kesh what the eventual plans for it were and what factors determined the  serving of internment orders several questions were asked about the response to sir edmund comptons enquiry and judge browns advisory committee 3 the seventy internees and forty detainees at crumlin have organised a committee of three to represent them and at the delegations request this committee met them in the governors office the committee refused to talk about conditions in the prison these were stated to be a matter between the internees the governor and the stormont government and talked instead about brutality when the original arrests were made later the committee after consulting their fellow internees told the delegation that they were not welcome in their wing of the prison other internees vocally supported them the delegation did not go in but i gather they believe conditions there to be good appreciate the efforts made to help families of internees internees di d not get much sympathy for their gakbmbbbykhsm  iw one meal hunger strike or the the mps  chang eeeee chanting staged for  at long kesh too the internees planned demonstrations for the delegation there was a profusion of posters and flags protesting about conditions demanding freedom and calling for mr faulkners resignation these were produced  by a drilled group of internees in each compound and when they visited the compounds mps were quick to note the degree of internal organisation one compound in particular had a large proportion of self confessed ira men seeking but failing to dominate a smaller group variously described  as trade unionists and civil rights members members found the conditions at long kesh grim and thought internees  comparison with auschwitz was not unfair the place was crowded and the food not very tasty the whole place has the air of a building site  5 members clearly realised that at both places the internees  had put on a show for them but i would judge that their over whelming impression will be that while conditions in crumlin are fairly good if a little crowded conditions at longnkesh are more open to criticism  perhaps severe

UKREP BELFAST TELNO 72 OF 5 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE.
FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD.
1. THE ARMY HAVE SHOWN ME A BRIEF FOR GENERAL TUZO, FOR USE
IN TOMORROW'S TALKS, CONTAINING A RECOMMENDATION THAT A
DETERMINED EFFORT BE MADE TO RESTORE ORDER IN LONDONDERRY.
I A UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY IS ALSO BEING
BRIEFED ON THIS. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE FORCE LEVEL IN
LONDONDERRY BE RAISED FROM THE PRESENT THREE BATTALIONS TO
A TOTAL OF SIX BATTALIONS. I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MY
PRELIMINARY VIEWS NOW, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT YET HAD AN OPPORT
UNITY OF DISCUSSING THE PROPOSAL WITH TUZO.
2. I THINK THAT LOW PROFILE EFFORTS TO BRING ORDER TO LONDONDERRY
HAVING FAILED, AND THE CREDIBILITY OF OUR MILITARY EFFORT THERE
HAVING TAKEN A KNOCK, IT IS NOW TIME TO PUT IN THE FORCES
NECESSARY TO RESTORE ORDER ON THE STREETS AND, HOPEFULLY TO
CAPTURE THE GUNMEN OR FRIGHTETEN THEM AWAY. IF IN ADDITION,
THE RESTORATION OF ORDER AND THE REMOVAL OF IRA INTIMIDATION,
SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE CATHOLIC

COMMUNITY TO SPEAK UP, THIS WOULD PROVIDE USEFUL EVIDENCE
OF WHAT MIGHT BE ACHIEVED

ELSEWHERE.

I THINK WE MUST

REALISE HOWEVER THAT ACTION IN LONDONDERRY WILL HAVE
NEGATIVE AS WELL AS POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES ELSEWHERE IN THE
PROVINCE. INITIALLY, AT ANY RATE, CATHOLICS EVERYWHERE WILL
BE DRIVEN FURTHER INTO THEIR STRAITJACKET OF OPPOSITION
AND PROTEST. PROTESTANT SATISFACTION AT STRONG ACTION IN
LONDONDERRY (AND IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY COME AS A SHOT
IN THE ARM FOR FAULKNER AT THIS STAGE) WOULD
INEVITABLY LEAD TO DEMANDS FOR SIMILAR ACTION ELSEWHERE,

PARTICULARLY, ALTHOUGH THE CASES ARE NOT EQUAL,

IN

BELFAST. I WOULD EXPECT THE IRA TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO
INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITY IN BELFAST AND ELSEWHERE IN
RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN LONDONDERRY.

3. THE CONCLUSION I DRAW FROM THIS IS THAT THE PROPOSED ACTION
IN LONDONDERRY SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN ARMY
STRENGTH ELSEWHERE IN THE PROVINCE AS WELL. IT SHOULD BE PART
OF A GENERALLY STEPPED UP EFFORT, WITH THE OPERATIONS IN
LONDONDERRY BEING THE MOST EMPHATIC PART OF THAT EFFORT.

I ALSO CONSIDER THAT THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL
DRIVE LED FROM THE UK. THERE WOULD BE A WARNING OF OUR
RESOLUTION TO PUT DOWN VIOLENCE FROM WHICHEVER QUARTER
IT COMES. THERE SHOULD BE A RESTATEMENT OF THE FACT THAT
NO THIRD FORCE WILL BE TOLERATED AND THAT THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL. A REFERENCE
TO INTERNMENT SHOULD INCLUDE THE POINTS IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF
MY TELEGRAM NO 71 . THERE SHOULD BE A PASSAGE ON REFORM,
AND IN THAT CONNECTION I SHOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF
THE IDEA IN PARA 6 OF MY TELEGRAM NO 52 ABOUT A STANDING
COMMISSION. WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A MAJOR MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,
SHOWING EQUAL DETERMINATION IN THE MILITARY AND THE POLITICAL
FIELDS, AND ASSERTING THE AUTHORITY OF HMG IN THE UK IN
BOTH.

",to home office  ukrep belfast telno 72 of 5 october to home office following for woodfield 1 the army have shown me a brief for general tuzo for use in tomorrows talks containing a recommendation that a determined effort be made to restore order in londonderry i a understand that the defence secretary is also being briefed on this it is proposed that the force level in londonderry be raised from the present three battalions to a total of six battalions i think you should have my preliminary views now although i have not yet had an opport unity of discussing the proposal with tuzo 2 i think that low profile efforts to bring order to londonderry having failed and the credibility of our military effort there having taken a knock it is now time to put in the forces necessary to restore order on the streets and hopefully to capture the gunmen or frighteten them away if in addition the restoration of order and the removal of ira intimidation should encourage the moderate elements in the catholic  community to speak up this would provide useful evidence of what might be achieved  elsewhere  i think we must  realise however that action in londonderry will have negative as well as positive consequences elsewhere in the province initially at any rate catholics everywhere will be driven further into their straitjacket of opposition and protest protestant satisfaction at strong action in londonderry and it would undoubtedly come as a shot in the arm for faulkner at this stage would inevitably lead to demands for similar action elsewhere  particularly although the cases are not equal  in  belfast i would expect the ira to make every effort to increase their activity in belfast and elsewhere in response to events in londonderry  3 the conclusion i draw from this is that the proposed action in londonderry should be accompanied by an increase in army strength elsewhere in the province as well it should be part of a generally stepped up effort with the operations in londonderry being the most emphatic part of that effort  i also consider that this should be accompanied by political drive led from the uk there would be a warning of our resolution to put down violence from whichever quarter it comes there should be a restatement of the fact that no third force will be tolerated and that those who advocate it will not be allowed to prevail a reference to internment should include the points in paragraph 2 of my telegram no 71  there should be a passage on reform and in that connection i should like to remind you of the idea in para 6 of my telegram no 52 about a standing commission what i recommend is a major ministerial statement showing equal determination in the military and the political fields and asserting the authority of hmg in the uk in both smith

Ministers at the meeting tomorrow will have before them three main
documents.
A.

The brief for the discussion with Mr. Faulkner on the following day

(NIPMV(71) 1).
B.

A military appreciation by the Ministry of Defence (Mr.

Stephens'

letter of 4th October to Mr. Armstrong).
C.

A political appreciation by the Homo Secretary.
The military and political appreciations are complemented by an

intelligence appreciation, which has been specially prepared by tho JIC
on the basis of the latest information.
3.

The problems discussed in these documents have to be considered

against the background of Lord Carrington's recent visit to Northern Ireland
and the conclusions which he himself formed as a result.

I think that these

can be summarised as follows:(1)

In principle internment has been a success.

It has done what it was

intended to do; and, although there may still be a long haul ahead, the chance
of gradually bringing terrorism to an end are now reasonably good.
(2)

Direct rule would represent an even more appalling strain on our

resources than we have hitherto been prepared to contemplate.
(3)

We must therefore redouble our efforts to ensure that Mr. Faulkner

remains in power.

4.

You may like to begin the meeting by asking Lord Carrington to expan

on these points; and Ministers may then wish to consider whether
Lord Carrington's diagnosis is consistent with, and confirmed by,
the Home Secretary's political appreciation (I think that.' broadly,
both appreciation will come to the same conclusion).

Ministers

will then need to decidewhether they endorse Lord Carrington's conclusions,
This will be a critical decision, since it will determine our policy for as far

ahead as it is profitable to looks and its implications, both civil and military
will need to be

considered with care.

To implement the present policy there are in Northern Ireland
thirteen major units in the infantry role and two armoured
reconnaissance regiments.
The current deployment of these units is
seven battalions in 39 Brigade, three battalions in 8 Brigade, two

the people, the fewer we have available for active operations against
them.
The specific security measures now in hand to deal with
current problems include:
a.
Against the bombing campaign - the development of
anti-bomb techniques, analysing all incidents to date,
concentrating our defensive measures in small areas where
the IRA is expected to operate next, and pursuing and developing
our bomb squad techniques.
But to pursue these measures
effectively we need more intelligence.
b.
To meet the local clamour for protection - a limited
rearming of the Police specifically for police station guards;
and the expansion of the UDR.
The pressing aim has been to

find a solution which allows the Regular Army to be employed
not on static guards in penny packets but where it can best
seek out and destroy the IRA.
To harness local energies - an expansion of the UDR.

UNDERSTAND ALL THE ITEMS IN THE LIST CONTAINED IN SIR BURKE
TREND'S MESSAGE TO SIR HAROLD BLACK, CONTAINED IN CABINET
OFFICE TELEGRAM TO ME MISC. 146 OF 11 OCTOBER. ON THE FIRST
POINT HE DID NOT SEE WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE IN MIND TO IMPROVE
CONTACT BETWEEN LONDON AND BELFAST, IN VIEW OF THE FREQUENT
VISITS PAID BY MR FAULKNER. I SAID I DID NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT
BE IN MIND. BLOOMFIELD ALSO SEEMED SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE THAT
A FAST BALL WAS GOING TO BE BOWLED ON ITEM 3, ABOUT THE INTERNMENT
SITUATION AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AGAIN I HAD TO DISCLAIM
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MIGHT COME UP, BUT SAID THAT A NUMBER OF
QUESTIONS HAD OCCURRED TO ME. WHEN WOULD THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE
GET DOWN-TO WORK? BLOOMFIELD SAID HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO SO IN A
DAY OR TWO. I SAID THAT SOME NEWSPAPERS HAD SAID THAT ALTHOUGH
INTERNEES WOULD BE ENTITLED TO LEGAL ADVICE, THEY WOULD
NOT BE ABLE TO BRING THEIR LEGAL ADVISERS WITH THEM WHEN THEY
APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. I WONDERED WHETHER THIS WAS
REALLY TRUE. IT WOULD LOOK ODD, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT
THAT THOSE APPEARING BEFORE SIR E. COMPTON'S GROUP COULD BE
ACCOMPANIED BY LEGAL ADVISERS. NEXT, I RECALLED THAT STOUT
HAD TOLD YOU THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE FULL ACCESS TO
RELEVANT DOCUMENTS AND WOULD BE ENTITLED TO INTERVIEW POLICE
OFFICERS. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO CONFIRM THIS AND MIGHT
BE USEFUL TO MAKE IT KNOWN. MR FAULKNER HAD INDICATED AT HIS PRESS
CONFERENCE AFTER THE TRIPARTITE MEETINGS THAT ALTHOUGH THE
COMMITTEE WAS AN ADVISORY ONE HE WOULD EXPECT TO TAKE ITS ADVICE.
THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR MINORITY OPINION AND MG EEEEE
MIGHT BE GIVEN GREATER PUBLICITY. I SAID I WONDERED WHETHER,
IF THESE POINTS COULD BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A CLEAR STATEMENT,
IT MIGHT NOT BE A USEFUL THING TO MAKE PUBLIC.

3.
YOU
YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE THAT BLOOMFIELD HAS TAKEN BADLY THE
SUGGESTION THAT IN CONNEXION WITH THE ITEM ON CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
THERE SHOULD BE DISCUSSION ON THURSDAY ABOUT LEGISLATION TO RECOVER
RECOVER RENTS AND RATES. HE REGARDS THIS AS IMPOSING AN UNDESIRABLE
DELAY.

CARRINGTON'S VISIT, CERTAIN MEASURES WOULD BE DECIDED UPON,
ESPECIALLY THE BLOWING-UP OF ROADS, IN TIME FOR MR FAULKNER
TO ANNOUNCE THEM IN THE STATEMENT HE MAKES IN STORMONT WHEN
IT REASSEMBLES TOMORROW. I SAID I COULD NOT GIVE HIM AN
ANSWER ON THIS. IF THERE WAS AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR FAULKNER
AND MR HEATH THAT THE THURSDAY MEETING COULD BE ANNOUNCED IN
STORMONT TOMORROW, THIS MIGHT ENABLE MR FAULKNER TO DELAY

Initial discussions with the Northern Ireland Government,

Government sought.
The Home Secretary told Mr. Faulkner that the United Kingdom Government
had decided to keep Sydenham operating beyond 1973.

It would operate on a

reduced basis so far as military personnel were concerned, but there would not
be redundancies affecting civil employment.

Mr. Faulkner welcomed this decision

and expressed his appreciation for the understanding shown by the Ministers
concerned.
The Home Secretary told Mr. Faulkner that he proposed that Sir Edmund Compton
be asked to carry on dealing with complaints from persons arrested with a view
to internment.

This, together with the arrangements which were being made for

a Board of Visitors to hear complaints of people once they were received into

provided with automatic weapons to guard police stations where the army were
unable to provide protection.

He was not disposed to agree to the use of

automatic weapons by police officers on the streets.

he supported the Chief Constable's proposal that mobile patrols should have
machine-gun support if necessary.

The Home Secretary referred to

arrangements which had been made at local initiative whereby a soldier with an
automatic weapon sometimes accompanied an R.U.C. patrol.

The Ministry of Defence

has now made arrangements so that this practice would be encouraged, though it
would be wrong to suggest that all cases would be covered.

The army was also

providing protection for vehicles.

The Home Secretary said that much of the criticism in the recent debate
had centred on procedures for internment.

If these could be modified it would

be easier to retain support for the principle of internment itself.
said that this was under active consideration.

Mr. Faulkner

He had it in mind that an

internee might be told in writing of the allegation against him: the statement
would be on the lines that he was a member of an unlawful association, or actively
involved in the recent campaign of violence.

The Home Secretary asked whether the

statement would give such detail as the type of illegal organisation - Brady or
Goulding - to which it was alleged that the individual belonged.
said that he was disinclined to go into such detail.

Mr. Faulkner

Mr. Faulkner said that

Judge Brown's Committee might consider cases in two stages, with lawyers
admitted to one but not to the other.

The Home Secretary suggested that

Judge Brown's Committee might be expanded in view of the large amount of work
for them to do.

A Commonwealth Judge might be included: it might even be

necessary for panels to be formed.

First, the reason for interment is simply that

would not inimost cases stand up in court.

Examples are attached of the kind of

information which is known about individuals.

Much of it is simplynot

up to the

standards of evidence required in the courts. Secondly, even if the evidence did
stand up, there are obvious and overriding objections to disclosing its nature
to the defence or arranging for a confrontation between the security services and
the

person involved

which is the minimum

of that is required for the hearing

to be described as being in any way before a court.

in peril; and prejudice the sources of the information.

Even if the case were

held in camera, the defence would still know.

The Attorney General cannot see how

any moral accusatorial procedure could work.

Mr Dalton,

He said that the evidence put before the Advisory Committee by Special Branch was

adequate to enable the Committee to reach a judgment, but that it would not
convince a court.

for internment and the procedure which has so far been adopted.

They had little

hope that the Commission would be able to suggest any new procedures, but thought
that if HNG and the Northern Ireland Government were to take the initiative
in reviewing interrment, this might in itself create sufficient goodwill to

enable other political initiatives to be taken.
There are I think some improvements which might be made to the interrment
appeal procedure

for example, by allowing legal representation of internees

at the hearing - but this would be little more than window dressing and would
be regarded as tinkering.
I remain much disturbed by all this.

Unless we can make some gesture

on interrment,it is difficult to see how the talks can get started. But I
simply don't see how we can abandoninternment at this stage.

",2 if mr lynch enquires how long it will be before lord parkers committee reports you should say that you do not know the reason is that there has been a delay in constituting it as a result of the failure of the labour party so far to nominate a privy councillor to take part you should discourage any suggestion that mr lynch may make for an independent tribunal to investigate allegations this would in any case be politically unacceptable but even if it were not it would be open to all the difficulties about the intimidation of witnesses and reprisals etc which obliged stormont to resort to internment rather than trials you should avoid getting into a discussion of mr harold wilsons speech ministers will no doubt be considering his proposals but in view of the decision of the opposition to divide the house when the debate resumes on monday in terms which in parts appear to contradict points made by mr wilson it is not at present clear exactly what his proposals amount to any comment which ministers feel a b 1 e to make will be contained in speeches made during the course of the debate

ier, M.P,,

Old Hall,

Dear Mr. Prior,
I have continued to do what I can to emphasize to Mr. Lynch

the goodwill of Mr. Heath and his colleagues. If I may, however,
there are one or two points which I feel I should make.
Mr. Lynch is very much a man of peace and has, as you know,
kept to this policy under, at times, very difficult conditions.
There would appear to be some feeling in Britain that it might
have been possible for him to introduce internment in the South.
It is not, I think, fully realised, just how strong a shift in

public opinion is taking place in the South. Far from taking
steps against Northern republicans he is instead in a situation

where any aid or assistance to them would be widely welcomed in
the South. There is a very definite tide flowing, the strength
of which it would be easy to underestimate. This tide is in
favour of aid to the Nationalists in the North.
At one time it would have been fair to say that the overwhelming weight of opinion in the South was against any form of
serious support for the Nationalists or Republicans in the North.
Among the older section of the population this may still, to some
extent, be the case, but not among the general populace.
Such currents of opinion, once under way, are very difficult
to reverse.
I cannot help feeling that the very real dangers of
a Protestant backlash in the North have been allowed to obscure
the far greater danger of a Catholic or Nationalist reaction
both North and South. There is, in my opinion, a very real danger

that affairs in Ulster will gradually slide, against the wishes of

negotiations. It would, however, need to be made clear
that Northern Ireland would be one of the subjects
e

discussed, as it would be disingenuous to pretend
otherwise.

The Prime Minister agrees with the Home Secretary's
view, recorded in your letter of 21 April that, before
the meeting with Mr Lynch, we should need to be as
clear as possible about what we should wish to obtain
from the meeting. He agrees that officials should
now provide an assessment of what the objective should
be. The Prime Minister's own conception of the purpose
of the meeting is as follows. He would explain frankly
to Mr. Lynch that the problem in Northern Ireland was
now not essentially that of improving the civil rights
of the minority but of eradicating terrorism and that
the continuance of Mr. Faulkner'sGovernment (and the
avoidance of something worse) depends largely on solid
progress being made on this issue. We would then
explain suchtougher measures as we might have it in
mind to take (for example, on the border and on internment) so that, if and when these measures were taken,
Mr. Lynch would understand the background and would be
less likely to react adversely. But the main purpose
would be to find out whatMr.Lynch thought that he
might be able to do to deal with the I.R.A., bearing
in mind that the last outbreak was solved mainly by
action in the Republic, and that effective action south
of the border would lessen the need for more drastic
measures north of the border.
This outline may be useful as a starting-point
for the assessment by ofofficials which the Prime Minister

hopes could be completed quickly.

3190,IMG_6459_PREM_15_1000,"Political Issues: Inter-Party Talks
The immediate question concerns the nature of the replies to the
letters which the Home Secretary has received from Mr. Callaghan and

Sir Harry Nicholas about the scope of the proposed talks.

Mr. Callaghan's

letter simply asks for confirmation that they would be ""open-ended"", while
ir harry Nicholas says more explicitly that internment is an impediment to
the success of any political initiative.

The Government's reply should

presumably confirm that any talks would be ""open-ended"" in the sense of
being without prejudice and without commitment on the part of any of the
participants.

But should it not add that this means, so far as the

Government are concerned, that there can be no question of ending
internment unilaterally, i.e. so long as violence persists ?
2.

If so, however, the prospects for the talks are not bright.

Dr. Paisley has indicated that he will not take part if unification is
on the agenda; and, despite some recent haverings by Mr. Fitt, it
seems fairly clear that the SDLP will not participate if the Government

say that they are not prepared to end internment.

This is not necessarily

an unsatisfactory position for the Government, at least in the short term,
since public opinion is not likely to agree that the Government should let
loose a lot of gunmen and terrorists in return for no more than a promise
merely to take part in inter-Party talks without any assurance that they will
have a successful outcome.

And, provided that internment itself is properly

managed (and this is for discussion under a later item on the agenda) and
that the Army seem to be continuing to gain the upper hand over the IRA,
the Government can probably afford to rest in this position at least for the

time being.
3.

But it is not

a long-term policy; and sooner or later the Government

will he driven to try to devise some new political initiative which offers

better prospects of success than inter-Party talks as at present envisaged.
Here we confront the old dilemma - should any new initiative be based on the
fundamental premises that the Border remains intact and that the Stormont
system continues;
assumptions?

or should it envisage some basic modification in these

Hitherto, Ministers have judged that it would not be

possible to modify

ither of them without risking the fall of Mr. Faulkner's

Government and the inevitable need, as a result, to introduce direct rule.

ENQUIRY INTO THE FUTURE OFNORTHERN
BBC'S

IRELAND

The BBC wentahead with their programme on Wednesday 5 January
5.
in an atmosphere of public controversy. The Home Secretary had
previously written to the Chairman of the Governors of the BBC saying
that the program, in the form in which it had been devised, could do
no good and night do serious harm; and Mr Faulkner also made public
his view that no StormontMinister should take part. Those appearing
in the programme included Mr Harold Wilson MP (in a pre-recording),
Mr Ian Paisley MP, Mr Gerry FittMP, Mr Robert Cooper, (co-chairman of
the Alliance Party) Mr Neil Blaney, Mr David Bleakley, Miss Bernadette
Devlin MP, Mr Michael O'Kennedy and Mr John Maginnis MP. The
""tribunal"" conducting the programme were Lord Devlin (chairman),
Lord Caradon and Sir John Foster QC MP.
WITHDRAWAL OF UK TROOPS IN CYPRUS BY THEREPUBLIC
Itwas announced on 3 January that the Government of the Republic
6.
had decided to begin the process of reducing the strength of the
contingent of the Republic's troops in theUN force in Cyprus by 250
of the 391 men. About 160 returned home on 5 January and a further
92 are expected to do so an 19 January. The decision to reduce the
strength of the contingent was taken in order to ""make more troops
available for service at hme, thus reducing the heavy burden of duty
falling on the existing personnel"". The 140 men left on duty in
long as the U requires them, or the
Cyprus would remain there""as
situation at home permits"".
MEASURES IN THE REPUBLIC

AGAINST THE IRA

It seems that the Government of the Republic may be considering
7.
what measures would need to be taken should violence and intimidation
in rease in the Republic. Mr O'Malley, the minister for Justice, said

on 4 January that he did not think it was necessary to create more
severe penalties for illegal possession of firearms. However, recent
incidents such as the disturbances at Ballyshannon and the firing of
shots at the funeral at the weekend f Jack McCabe, when a paramilitary uniformed escort was provided, may be causing the Government
alarm, and have led to speculation that legislation against the
wearing of certain types ofuniform might be under consideration.
here has been some speculation whether the Government of the Republic
may be obliged to contemplate the reintroduction of internment. It
has also been reported that the establishment of some form of military
courts may become necessary if intimidation of juries and of the
judiciary were to increase. Prosecutions - on charges of obstruction,
riotous assembly, malicious damage and alleged incitement to violence
are pending against a number of people involved in the recent
disturbances at Ballyshannon.

The Official Committee on Northern Ireland met this morning to
prepare for the next Ministerial discussion, which should not be later,
I think, than the early part of next week.

The most important of the

outstanding issues is the present situation as regards the proposed inter-

Since the Home Secretary saw Mr. Callaghan before

Party talks.

The first was from

Christmas he has received two letters on the subject.

Mr. Callaghan himself on 30 December and asks the Home Secretary, in
effect, to confirm Mr. Callaghan's understanding that there would be no
barrier to the discussion of any relevant topic which any one of the Parties
represented might wish to raise.

The Home Secretary considers that he

has already covered this point by making public his New Year message to
Mr. Faulkner, in which he confirmed that the agenda for the discussions
would be open.

The other letter is from Sir Harry Nicholas, informing the

Home Secretary of a resolution of the National Executive Committee of the
Labour Party passed on 22 December to the effect that the NEC condemned
the policy of internment and the methods of interrogation revealed by the
Compton Report; urged the Government to confirm that the inter-Party
talks proposed would be open-ended and to convene them immediately
thereafter;

and recorded the view that ""the continuation of internment of

British subjects without charge or trial is an impediment to the success of
any political initiative"".

The resolution therefore endorses, by implication,

the SDLP line that internment must end before they can take part in talks.
I understand that the Home Secretary proposes to consult his colleagues

before replying to either of these communications.

This certainly needs

to be done before Parliament resumes at the latest; and the question of the
Government's attitude towards inter-Party talks might, I suggest, be the
principal item for a meeting next week, unless you want to take the
opportunity to raise it after the DOP meeting tomorrow, when the Home
Secretary and the Defence Secretary will be available.

Other topics mentioned at the meeting this morning were:The security situation.

BBC and Northern Ireland
It seems that the BBC

had got themselves into the position where

whatever official discouragement they encountered, they felt too far

committed to their debate programme on Northern Ireland to be able to
drop it.

This is perhaps because their top management gave premature

approval for the programme, without first satisfying themselves that
it was sensibly conceived - and thus, without realising that much of
the punning for it was inept.

It does not seem likely to be a very

successful production.
10.

Mr. Michael Charlton has tentatively proposed that ""Panorama""

should make a programme - mainly in Northern Ireland - on the subject
of urban guerrilla warfare.

He envisages that the programme would

include interviews with the GOC and perhaps other Army commanders in
the Province.

(He mentioned interviewing Brigadier Kitson, but it

would probably not be in that officer's own interest to be given

further prominence as a counter-insurgency expert while he is still

serving in northern Ireland.)

Charlton

also envisages including

interview - which he guarantees would be hostile - with a 1eading

meber of the IRA, south of the border.
11.

This programeholds promise of being helpful in bringing out the

squalor and criminality of the IRA; and there may be advantage in

seen to be willing to co-operate with the BBC when they are trying to
make a responsible programme.

It might be as well to check, in addition, that the police in this

Christmas, about which there have been several rumours.
3.

In addition the following specific questions need attention:(i)

Internment procedures.

The Home Secretary raised with

Mr. Faulkner at their recent meeting the possibility of
improving these procedures,

e. g. by giving an internee a

written statement of the allegation against him;

by

considering appeals in two stages, with legal representation
at one but not at the other;

and by enlarging the Appeals

Committee in order to accelerate the hearings.

Against the background of the ICRC report,

we cannot afford a scandal on this point;

and, since there

seems to be some difference of view between the Home Office
and the Ministry of Defence about the action to be taken (see
the minute of 9th December from the Secretary of State for
Defence to the Home Secretary), it would be useful to clarify
this point and to define the responsibility for dealing with it.

You may remember that on October 14th last year, after leaving the
series but before taking up my present duties, I sent you some thoughts
on Ireland in contemplation of the impending escalation.
At the end I
outlined a possible deal by which the Irish Government might at some stage
be

(politically)

bribedto look up the I.R.A.

I have just had similar

thoughts fed back to me from an unexpected quarter, in very much the form
I put them to you.
2.
Last Wednesday (November 17th) my wife and I refused an invitation
to dine at the Irish Embassy (poor Donal O'Sullivan says he gets a very
high proportion of refusals nowadays); but the dinner was cancelled and
we agreed to go round for a quiet drink.
I had about an hour with Donal.
I had not seen his for nearly a year, and though certainly I found his
views very interesting, I thought it best to ask whether he had said all
this stuff to his proper contacts such as Stewart Crawford.
His reply,
verbatim: ""In a way, yes, but more by personal hints and indications,
muchless plainly... Andrew, you would do well to report this""
3.
I have hesitated for several days before troubling you with what may
for all I know be pointless reading.
However, Colley's renewed public
attack on the I.R.A. (Friday's ""Telegraph"") has encouraged me to do so;
and even the fact that the Ambassador wants his ideasreported may be of
some small and useful significance to you.
In brief, the deal would be:-

4.

(a) some (public) light at the end of the tunnel for the Republic.
This would point not so such to a unified Ireland - which they
are scared to death of - but towards their entitlement to have

some say in considering the future of the North.

(b) a constitutional change inNorthern Ireland by which the minority
would have a fair share in the management of affairs.

(c)
5.

the internment of the I.R.A.

by the Dublin Government.

Naturally I asked whether the Irish Government was in a position to

deliver (c).
On this the Ambassador was most emphatic.
Lynch was
known to be willing, and Hillery, who was in many ways an awkward customer,
had specifically said to O'Sullivans ""We would certainly do it - I

would be for it.""
Colley's new attitude might also be significant.
But
any move could come onlyas part of a deal: no Irish Government in the
present climate of opinion would dare to move significantly against the
I.R.A. without something which would really enable them to sway the Irish
public in favour of a peaceful solution, and into acceptance of the measures
needed to secure peace.
6.
That was the main point, and indeed O'Sullivan came back several
times to the possibility of internment in the South.
7.
Another noteworthy point was that O'Sullivan repeatedly pressed me
on whether some new political initiative by the British Government might
be expected soon.
I professed total ignorance (and very genuinely) but
said that if I myself were thinking of one, I would propose it for
Christmas; he appeared to take this seriously.
8.
The Ambassadors anxiety for an early British initiative arises from
fears over the position of Lynch.
He contested with earnest emotion my
suggestion that whoever succeeded Lynch would unavoidably and very speedily
learn to follow (no worse than) a Lynch policy.
The probable successor
at present, he said, was Hillery, possibly a Hillery/Haughey partnership,
which would be a reckless combination and cause us infinite trouble.
An
election with a victory for the Opposition would be a disaster:
even if
they were to be regarded as worthy, they were incompetent and could not
possibly cope with the I.R.A. the way Lynch could.
(I suppose one could
translate this by saying that Fianna Fail are closer to the I.R.A. than
Fine Gael and the Irish Labour Party; which is true).

9.
The word 'internment' was not once mentioned but we got on to the
subject of direct rule.
O'Sullivan was most apprehensive over this:
it
was essential to maintain Stormont.
When I probed this we decided that
what he meant was not the constitution, but the constitutional status.
He did not even want to see Stormont suspended, since he (very rightly)
believes that any suspension would inevitably be permanent, because no one
could ever contemplate restoring that very odd edifice.
Direct rule would
be a victory for the I.R.A. and a step towards civil war.
10.

A re-drawing of the border and an exchange of populations might once

have been possible but in present circumstances would be an invitation to
riot and bloodshed.
11. I made relatively little contribution to the conversation except at
the end when I picked up a reference of the Ambassador's to the increasingly
anti-British state of feeling in Dublin.
I told him that the Irish Government
should try to prevent their public being misled by the British media and by
our well-known habit of discrediting our own forces.
No huffing or puffing
by Irish public opinion would lead to the result that many people in Dublin
now appeared to regard as possible or available - that the British would not
merely withdraw the troops from Northern Ireland but would disarm every single
Protestant before doing so.
That possibility was not available, so that
any serious present-day attempt to secure the unification of Ireland could
only lead to the spread of terror and destruction to the South,
in fact to
civil war.
The Ambassador did not dissent, but my view is that the genuine

fear of civil war, which was principally responsible for keeping the Irish
in a restrained position during 1968 - 70, has recently been dissipated and

Possible arms amnesty
9.

In a period of much-reduced terrorism - whether or not there

it would be worth

considering whether to offer an amnesty for illegally held

If this were done, it should also be made the occasion

for trying to haul in some of the very many weapons held legally
(mainly, of course, by the Protestants).

This would need the

sanction of a clear threat that in future the licencing of
firearms would be much more stringent.

If that could be agreed

with the Northern Ireland Government, the initiative on this
subject could then take the form of an announcement that licencing
was in future going to be conducted more restrictively;

that

anyone who felt he could dispense with his firearms was therefore
urged to hand them in; and that anyone handing in an unlicensed
firearm - within a very limited period - would be immune from

IRELAND - INTERNMENT ACCOMMODATION

As you know, there are immediate problems in providing
sufficient accommodation for internees and detainees in
Northern
Ireland to keep pace with the number of terrorists on whom
detention and internment orders are being served.
2.
The Northern Ireland Government have asked that, to deal
with the bulk of the prospective excess, use should again be made
of the accommodation ship MAIDSTONE - this time to house up to
150 internees.
From the Army's point of view, this is an
extremely inconvenient request, since we had hoped to use

MAIDSTONE

(together with another accommodation

ship HARTLAND POINT,

which is being moved to Belfast later this month) for much-needed

accommodation for soldiers during the winter months.
Nevertheless,
on the facts as presented to me, I can see no alternative: I have
therefore reluctantly agreed that MAIDSTONE should be made available for this purpose.
At the same time, I must place on record
some dissatisfaction that the matter has been presented for
Ministerial decision in this form and at such short notice, when
Sir James Dunnett has for some time been drawing attention at his
daily meetings to the evident need for the Prison Authorities
to take steps to meet the crisis that was only too evidently
developing and when I understand that the GOC has similarly been
warning the Northern Ireland Government of the difficulties ahead.

3.
If MAIDSTONE is to be used it will of course be essential
that there should be adequate arrangements for guarding the
inmates.
I learn from the GOC that the Northern Ireland Prison
Service are hardpressed to find sufficient custodial staff for the
task of guarding internees, and this problem will be aggravated
by the re-opening of MAIDSTONE.
No doubt you are considering
this aspect of the matter.
It may be something which should be
raised at our GEN 47 meeting on Monday morning.

recent suggestions in the Press and on tdevision that the Army over-reacted
against some of the Civil Rights demonstrations last weekend and that, in
particular, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment, by being unnecessarily
rough, have gratuitously provoked resentment among peaceful elements of
the Roman Catholic population.
13.

Overshadowing this question, however, is the graver issue of the

attitude to be adopted by the security forces if the renewed ban on marches
is openly defied.

Are we able - and prepared - to deal with that situation?

Perhaps the question should be explored urgently with Mr. Faulkner during

3404,IMG_6673_PREM_15_1001,"Detailed Elements of the proposed Reform
The meeting on 20th January agreed to resume its discussion of the
Home Secretary's paper (GEN 47(72) 1) with a view to identifying questions
which might be referred to officials for further analysis or action.

The

chief of such questions, with some notes on the present state of their
examination, appear to be as follows:(a)

The Border.

Should this be the subject of a referendum?

Should there be local plebiscites;
the local units be?

and, if so, how large should

How would the question be posed?

What

The formula adopted

legislative provision would be required?

in the instructions to Parliamentary Counsel is that the 1949 Act
provision - i. e. that only with the agreement of the Northern
Ireland Parliament shall Northern Ireland or any part of it
cease to be part of the United Kingdom - should be repealed
and should be replaced by a provision that neither Northern
Ireland nor any part thereof shall cease to be part of
Her Majesty's Dominions and of the United Kingdom unless a
referendum (in the form prescribed in the Bill - the machinery
should cause no trouble)

establishes that a majority of the people

of Northern Ireland support such a course.

It would not be out

of the question to hold a referendum related to part and not the
whole of Northern Ireland.

But the Republic is not likely to

welcome such a course (which would reduce the proportion of
Catholics in Northern Ireland and risk encumbering the Republic
with unquiet areas); and the identification of areas suitable for
local plebiscites would present difficulties.

But the Home

Secretary seems committed to the idea that the first plebiscite
should not be held for 15 or 20 years.

Would it be wrong,

however, to inaugurate the reform with a plebiscite?

(b)

Transfer of Law and Order

(i)

What should this heading comprise?

In GEN 47(71) 8 the

Chairman of the Official Committee suggested the police,
the Special Powers Acts, prosecutions, courts, prisons
and internment camps and the probation and children's ,services.

It would thus involve all aspects of the internment policy,

including decisions on the making of individual internment

or with his reasons for dismissing the first two of these in favour of the
third, i. e. his own plan.

They may also accept his definition (at the top

of page 3) of the three elements which that plan must comprise.

But,

before examining those elements in detail, the Committee should consider

avoiding direct rule or whether it is almost bound to end in, if not actually

As regards the details of the plan, its first element
is the plebiscite
on the Border.
The Home Secretary proposes not holding the first
plebiscite for 15 or 20 years.

Would this be right?

A plebiscite may hold
out rather better hope of excluding the Border from day to day politics than
the present system;

but the Republicans would still be likely to complain

that it was unfairly loaded against them and that the result was a foregone
conclusion.

If a plebiscite were decided on, would it be on a universal

basis, or on a territorial basis with the possibility of ceding territory (with
all the emotional dangers that involves for Londonderry)?
6.

It may be better to consider the powers to be left with the

Northern Ireland Government before examining how the corresponding
responsibilities would be administered.

The transfer of responsibility for

law and order may be right in principle;

but there would be some rough

edges in practice.

The civil disobedience campaign and the measures to

counter it are in essence matters of law and order, although they are not
so handled as a matter of machinery.

The transfer of law and order except

on the narrowest interpretation (and there are a number of gradations)
would involve us in responsibility for internment.

How far is internment

to be brought into the political package?
When we come to the composition of the Government to exercise the

residual powers,

the Home Secretary suggests a compulsory coalition

i. e. a coalition enforced by legislation at Westminster.

Normally,

envisage a coalition as being between the ""regular"" Unionists and the
Roman Catholic minority.

A coalition,

If we needed to take the

Parliamentary institution at Stormont seriously, this might matter;

legislative power.

A coalition Government would therefore need to be

supplemented by action at the administrative grass-roots,

ensure the minority their fair share of appointments on public boards,

There are clearly several aspects of the plan which need further

examination;

and the Committee may wish to remit it to officials for

detailed consideration as a matter of urgency, against the moment when it

may be opportune to launch it.

Internment
9.

A number of practical considerations regarding internment are

relevant to the substance and timing of a political initiative.
10.

Either the improvement of the security situation or a political

requirement to conciliate the Catholics may prompt some modification of the
starting perhaps with the release of some of the less

internment policy,
harmful internees.

But what is being done to identify the less dangerous

internees. and to arrange for their segregation from the hard core?
Practically nothing according to paragraph 19 of Current Situation Report
56 of 17th January!

No.

The Home Secretary should therefore be asked when

progress may be expected both in this regard and in respect of ""rehabilitation"",

about which General Ford spoke to you when you visited Northern Ireland
last month.

(It will be desirable,

""rehabilitation"";

however,

to be clear on what is meant by

and on the financial responsibility for any resulting

)

expenditure.
11.

We also understand that the Northern Ireland Government have under

consideration a number of proposals for improving the internment procedure,
e. g. by using a Tribunal not only to review the cases of persons already
interned but to make recommendations on whether internment orders should be
served on persons detained.

You may wish to ask what pressure is being

put on Stormont to consider this seriously.

12.

The Protestants' reaction to any political initiative will be affected by

their assessment of the security situation;

and from this aspect every major

escape of internees or detainees is politically, as well as practically,

unfortunate.

The last GEN 47 meeting was informed that the Northern

Ireland Prison Service had been supplied with the best possible advice on
measures to prevent escapes.

The extent to which the recent escapefrom

HMS Maidstone reflects blame upon the internal guards provided by the

Northern Ireland Prison Service, or on the external guards provided by t
security forces, is not entirely clear;

but you maywish again to ask the

and Defence Secretaries whether they are completely satisfied that ever

possible is being done to prevent escapes.

new internment camp was a matter for the Northern
Ireland Government.
It must however be accepted
that such camps ought not be located in remote,

The reason why an additional camp was needed was ghat more
and more wanted men were being arrested and it was
because of this that the IRA were now in some difficulty.
He had pointed out some time ago to Mr. Lynch that, if
internment were to be introduced in the South as well

Internment policy
17.

The latest available figures for internments,
detentions and
releases are attached at Annex.
18.

The opening of Magilligan Camp on Sunday, with the transfer of
forty detainees from HMS MAIDSTONE,has given rise to a good deal of
speculation about the future of internment generally and, in
particular, about the number of people whom the security authorities
think it will be necessary to intern in order to render the IRA
ineffective.

There can in fact be no exact answer to this question

since, although we have a fairly clear idea of the number of
activists that there were in each wing of the IRA immediately before
internment, it is clear that they have been able to recoup at least

some of their losses with new recruits - though it in also very
clear that, in the process, the competence which their operations are
conducted has fallen away considerably.
19.

In the event of a more pronounced lull in terrorism - when there

may well be a case for some acceleration in the rate of release of
internees -

it

will of course be important to know a good deal

about how relatively dangerous each of them is.

The Northern Ireland

Government have made practically no headway so far in sorting the
internees physically into categories - for which they are apparently
now laying the blame
obtained

on the shortage of accommodation which has

hitherto. However, the Advisory Committee under Judge Brown

has by now reviewed, at least once, the case against about threequarters of those interned;

they should therefore have some idea of

wre altered

somewhat.

Estate whilst a wedding reception was in progress. The best
man was shot in the head while he was trying to tackle the
gunman as he planted the bomb. These latter two incidents were
strongly attacked by the Goulding IRA, largely because of public
anger within the Catholic community in Londonderry.

It was agreed that acomprehensive press release

Outlook
20. Security force activity in Belfast is likely to reduce still
further the ability of either faction of the IRA to undertake
sustained activity in the City. It is to be expected that crossborder activity, and activity in other rural areas, will continue
to be the main IRA tactic.
21. There are four or five Ulster Vanguard Rallies planned for

The
of the support which the new organisation has attracted.
Rallies are unlikely to present serious security problems.

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES
(JOINT ARMY/RUC PAPER FOR CONSIDERATION BY JSC)
INTRODUCTION
1. IN VIEW OF SPECULATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING THE

INTERNMENT PROCESS AS PART OF A POLITICAL REQUIREMENT, THERE
IS A NEED TO SET OUT THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF A RELEASE OF
INTERNEES, OTHER THAN THROUGH THE EXISTING MACHINERY.
SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
2. ALL THE INTERNEES ARE MEMBERS OF THE IRA: CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO
POOL OF INTERNEES WHO ARE MERELY POLITICAL ACTIVISTS. THERE IS AN
INHERENT RISK THAT ANY INTERNEE RELEASED AS A POLITICAL GESTURE
WILL RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND,
REPAIRING THE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE WHICH HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON
BOTH FACTIONS OF THE IRA SINCE 9 AUG 71.
3. THE PRIME TARGETS FOR RETALIATORY ACTION BY INTERNEES AFTER
RELEASE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY THE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH OF THE
PUC: THESE ARE FOR THE MOST PART KNOWN TO THOSE INTERNES WHOM THEY
HAVE ARRESTED OR INTERROGATED. INTHE PAST THE RISK TO SPECIAL
BRANCH HAS BEEN REDUCED BY REQUIRING RELEASED INTERNEES TO COMMIT

THEMSELVES TO A FORM OF OATH, AFFIRMATION OR UNDERTAKING TO
ABSTAIN FROM ALL FORMS OF MILITANT ACTIVITY. SOME SIMILAR
UNDERTAKING IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANY FUTURE RELEASES.
4. IN ANY PROGRAMME OF RELEASE FOR POLITICAL REASONS THE IRA WILL
CERTAINLY REGARD THE MEASURE AS PROOF OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS.

IT MAY ALSO BE SO REGARDED BY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES AND
THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE EFFECT OF THESE TWO FACTORS COULD WELL BE TO
INCREASE IRA RESISTANCE TO INTERROGATION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO
WEAKEN THE DETERMINATION OF MEMBERS OF THE BRANCH TO PURSUE
INTERROGATION TO SUCCESS. IT COULD ALSO SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE
RECRUITMENT AND RUNNING OF AGENTS. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE, THEREFORE,
THAT INTELLIGENCE PROCUREMENT WILL SUFFER.
5. ANY ATTEMPT TO LINK A PROGRAMME OF RELEASES WITH AN UNDERTAKING NOT TO MAKE FURTHER ARRESTS WOULD BE REGARDED BY THE IRA
AS A STILL GREATER SUCCESS AND THEY MUST BE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO RECOUP THEIR LOSSES AND TO EQUIP THEMSELVES TO
INTENSIFY OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE AT A DATE OF THEIR
OWN CHOOSING. TO RESTRICT ARRESTS FOR DETENTION TO LEADING IRA
MEMBERS ONLY MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE SECURITY
FORCES ALREADY DOMINATE THE TWO IRA FACTIONS BUT SUCH A DECISION
WOULD INHIBIT SECURITY FORCE ACTION IN AREAS WHERE THE IRA IS
STILL OPERATING EFFECTIVELY. EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO 9 AUG 71 MADE
IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT POLICE QUESTIONING WITHOUT THE SANCTION
OF DETENTION OF INTERNMENT IS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AS AN
INTELLIGENCE WEAPON IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THOSE ARRESTED HAVE
BEEN WELL BRIEFED ON THEIR RIGHTS. IRA RECRUITING WILL BENEFIT
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RELUCTANCE TO JOIN OF THOSE WHO FEAR
INTERNMENT IS OVERCOME, AND THOSE ON THE RUN WOULD BE ENCOURAGED
TO RETURN: THERE ARE ABOUT 140 SUCH PEOPLE OPERATING FROM SOUTH
OF THE BODER.
6. THE SEGREGATION AND REHABILITATION OF SELECTED INTERNEES
AS A PRELIMINARY TO THEIR RELEASE CAN HOWEVER BE TAKEN WITHOUT
THESE DISADVANTAGES.
7. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT, IN SPITE OF CAREFUL EXAMINATION,
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN PRESENT CONDITIONS (EG INTIMIDATION) TO

BRING PRESENT INTERNEES TO TRIAL.

1. MY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING TELEGRAM CONTAINS THE TEXT OF A PAPER
ON THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES TABLED
AT THE JOINT SECURITY COMMITTEE MEETING THISMORNING. DISCUSSION
WAS BRIEF. GENERAL TUZO SAID THAT THE PAPER SIMPLY REPRESENTED
THE VIEWS OF THE ARMY AND THE RUC ON THE SECURITY ASPECT. HE
RECOGNISED THAT ITS ARGUMENT HAD TO BE BALANCED BY THE ARGUMENT
THAT SOME RELEASE OF INTERNEES MIGHT HELP TO ATTRACT CATHOLIC
OPINION AWAY FROM THE IRA. THE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND THE HEAD
OF SPECIAL BRANCH EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMING AND OF NOT
DOING ANYTHING TO RAISE THE MORALE OF THE INTERNEES. MR FAULKNER
REFERRED TO THE BELIEF IN CATHOLIC CIRCLES (INCLUDING CATHOLIC
MEMBERS OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY WHO HAD SEEN HIM) THAT SOME OF
THOSE INTERNED WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE IRA, A BELIEF WHICH WAS
CONTRADICTED BY PARA. 2 OF THE PAPER. HE WONDERED WHETHER IT
WOULD BE USEFUL TO DEVISE A PROGRAMME FOR RELEASE OF INTERNEES
WHICH COULD BE STARTED ONCE VIOLENCE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL.
I DID NOT OFFER ANY COMMENT ON THE PAPER. THE MEETING TOOK NOTE
OF

IT.

2. MY VIEW IS THAT THE PAPER SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT TO THE JSC
AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NOT TO PRODUCE A PAPER JOINTLY
WITH THE RUC. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ARMY ARE WELL ENOUGH AWARE
OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH AND OF THE PROBLEMS FACING
THEM TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THEIR INTEREST TO WHITEHALL WITHOUT
IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES WITH SPECIAL BRANCH POSITIONS IN A JOINT
PAPER.
3. THE DISCUSSION IN JSC MOVED ON TO A SUGGESTION BY BLOOMFIELD
THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC STATEMENT WHICH WOULD BE DESIGNED
TO CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT INTERNMENT EG THE LEGAL BASIS
FOR IT AND THE RIGHT OF INTERNEES TO SECURE LEGAL ADVICE IN
PRESENTING THEMSELVES TO JUDGE BROWN'S COMMITTEE. IT APPEARED TO BE
THE THOUGHT OF SOME PRESENT AT THE MEETING THAT SUCH A PAPER
WOULD ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT ONLY IRA MEMBERS WERE INTERNED. MR
FAULKNER SAID THAT HE WAS SURE THAT UK MINISTERS WOULD LIKE
SOMETHING TO BE PUT OUT. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE STATEMENT SHOULD
ISSUE FROM THE JSC, AND ASKED THAT A DRAFT SHOULD BE READY WITHIN
48 HOURS. I QUESTIONED WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH A
STATEMENT TO ISSUE FROM THE JSC AND SAID THAT IN THAT CASE I WOULD
HAVE TO ASK FOR TIME TO REFER IT TO LONDON. MR FAULKNER SAID THAT
SINCE THAT WOULD CAUSE DELAY HE WOULD DROP HIS SUGGESTION THAT IT
SHOULD BE A JSC STATEMENT.
4. AFTER THE MEETING I SPOKE TO BLOOMFIELD AND POINTED OUT THAT
EVEN THOUGH THE STATEMENT ISSUED FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT
THE SUBJECT OF INTERNMENT WAS SO SENSITIVE THAT QUESTIONS MIGHT
WELL BE DIRECTED TO HMG IN PARLIAMENT, ESPECIALLY IF THE STATEMENT
DEALT WITH MATTERS SUCH AS THE IRA STATUS OF ALL INTERNEES AND THE
OPERATION OF JUDGE BROWN'S COMMITTEE. HE READILY TOOK THE POINT

THAT THE DRAFTING WOULD NEED TO BE DONE CAREFULLY.

",17 february 1 my immediately following telegram contains the text of a paper on the security implications of the release of internees tabled at the joint security committee meeting thismorning discussion was brief general tuzo said that the paper simply represented the views of the army and the ruc on the security aspect he recognised that its argument had to be balanced by the argument that some release of internees might help to attract catholic opinion away from the ira the chief constable and the head of special branch emphasised the importance of timing and of not doing anything to raise the morale of the internees mr faulkner referred to the belief in catholic circles including catholic members of the police authority who had seen him that some of those interned were not members of the ira a belief which was contradicted by para 2 of the paper he wondered whether it would be useful to devise a programme for release of internees which could be started once violence had been brought under control i did not offer any comment on the paper the meeting took note of  it  2 my view is that the paper should not have been put to the jsc and that it would have been better not to produce a paper jointly with the ruc it seems to me that the army are well enough aware of the attitude of the special branch and of the problems facing them to be able to represent their interest to whitehall without identifying themselves with special branch positions in a joint paper 3 the discussion in jsc moved on to a suggestion by bloomfield that there should be a public statement which would be designed to clear up some misconceptions about internment eg the legal basis for it and the right of internees to secure legal advice in presenting themselves to judge browns committee it appeared to be the thought of some present at the meeting that such a paper would also make clear that only ira members were interned mr faulkner said that he was sure that uk ministers would like something to be put out he suggested that the statement should issue from the jsc and asked that a draft should be ready within 48 hours i questioned whether it was appropriate for such a statement to issue from the jsc and said that in that case i would have to ask for time to refer it to london mr faulkner said that since that would cause delay he would drop his suggestion that it should be a jsc statement 4 after the meeting i spoke to bloomfield and pointed out that even though the statement issued from the northern ireland government the subject of internment was so sensitive that questions might well be directed to hmg in parliament especially if the statement dealt with matters such as the ira status of all internees and the operation of judge browns committee he readily took the point  that the drafting would need to be done carefully 5 see mift smith  sent 171625z twf rcvd at same time jcb k

You mentionedto me that the
Prime
wishedto
know the Army's latest thinking about the Minister
future of internment.
The Northern Ireland Government has made a provisional
classification of all the internees into three categories.
Those in the category Of least danger- which
roughly
25 percent (or 150) of the present internees contains
mostly
those who actually throw the bombsand fire theare
rifles.
They
are all IRA men; and their release carries the risk that
they
would go straight back to their previous activities,
with
incentive to assassinate those in the security forces whom an
they
now think they knowto have been responsible for their original
detention.
Nevertheless the Army would accept in principle - though

obviously with some reluctance - that all the people in
this
category of least danger could be progressively released
if

political considerations

ade this desirable - and provided

that the political initiative was not followed by a major set
back,
(It would be greatly preferable to wait until those in

the category of least danger had been physically separated

from the others, and had experienced at least a short period
away from the hardore category, before starting to release
them).
As regards new internments, we would be totally opposed to

calling a complete halt, while being prepared to see greater
selectivity.

We quite apreciate that the political impact

would be greater if it could be announced that, along with
accelerating the release of those already interned, there
would be no further internment orders: but there are important
security reasons for not doing this. The morale and operational
effectiveness of the IRA, and hence their level of intimidation,
would inevitably rise the moment they knew that arrests under
the Special Powers Act had stopped.
It has to be remembered
that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast,
in mopping up known IRA member, has not so far been matched
in other parts of the Province. In Belfast the build-up of
intelligence, as a result of internment, has enabled this process
to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective
terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged.
Already the rate of new detentions and internments has fallen
well below the level of December, and it would be militarily

limit future new internments selectively to ring leaders
of whom a number of the most important are still at large,
But the Army consider it vital that the option should
remain of detaining and interning terrorists who are
captured in the rural areas, where the intelligence picture
is less complete and the IRA may well build up their
activities.
Further, the Army's willingness to see a larger
number of the present internees released rests on the
assumption that it will still be possible to re-arrest
any who are found to be engaging in violence again.
If
that power no longer exists, the situation even in Belfast
could quickly deteriorate again as those who are released
come back into circulation.
It will be necessary to
keep a very close watch on whether the first releases are
followed by any significant move towards reprisals against
the Security Forces, especially the RUC Special Branch and
the rest of the intelligence community, who will be
extremely vulnerable at that stage.
There should be no
relaxation of the present requirement that before an
internee can be released he must first sign an undertaking
not to engage in unlawful activity (though the form of the
present oath or affirmation may need to be modified).

The Northern Ireland Government will, of course,
have views about all this and we must expect them to be
much influenced by the attitude of the RUC Special Branch

-

-

The Army hope that those internees who are released
can be made subject to some form of licence or probation
we understand that the legal means may exist to do this.
But whether or not that practice is adopted, we consider
it essential - at least for the first few months - to
have the sanction of re-arrest and re-internment available.

which we know to be strongly opposed to a release rate
which is more than marginally faster than is now being

achieved.

The matter is due to be discussed at the next

meeting of the Joint Security Committee on 17th February

and I will let you know the outcome of that meeting as
soon as possible, That said, however, it is difficult to
see how any policy less forthcoming than the one I have
outlined above could make much of a contribution towards

6) Great patience is needed in trying to understand the Irish viewpoints.
There is a danger of losing one's temper and becoming exasperated with
both sides ( at least this is what I have found.) One has to remember
effectively all the time that the Irish are not English (unfortunately).

9)

There is a propaganda war going on which we have to win. We have
to try and influence first British opinion, then opinion in Northern Ireland,
then in the Republic, and finally in the rest of the world.
This requires
an major operation. World opinion has now become much more important than

it was some weeks ago.

possibility of an opening yet. Perhaps there has to be further bloodshed
and exhaustion before a settlement can be reached.

the risk of failure in any initiative is very high, but it is a risk which

: THE PLAN

A new policy for Northern Ireland might be made up of the

following elements:periodic referenda;
changes in the size, composition and method of election
to the Northern Ireland Parliament, on the lines
proposed in the Northern Ireland Government's Green Paper;
provision for community government;
possible changes in responsibility for law and order,
including a move towards running down internment.
PERIODIC REFERENDA

The object is (a) to reassure Protestant opinion and (b) to

attempt to remove the border as an issue from the ordinary government
and administration of the province.

The following scheme is

proposed:
(i)

Repeal of the provision in the Ireland Act 19`9 that
Northern Ireland or any part of it will not cease to be
part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the
Parliament of Northern Ireland.

(ii)

A new provision providing for the consent of a referendum
in place of the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament.
(The question would be raised whether local boundary
adjustments could be made with a local poll only;

this

seems to us an unlikely starter.)
(iii)

The question to be put in the referendum might be:

The possibility has to be faced however that at present it

might well be found that no member of a community government would
be able to discharge responsibility for law and order with the
consent of his colleagues and of the population at large, and it
would seem necessary to be prepared to make other arrangements,
with the hope that the need for them would be temporary.
13.

The main law and order functions are police;

prisons

(including internment camps); the functions of the Attorney-General
in relation to prosecutions;

judicial appointments;

and the

exercise for so long as necessary of the Special Powers Act.
If there were a decision to transfer to Westminster, these
functions would be provided for specifically, and in addition
power should be taken to transfer the various minor matters in
connexion with law and order, but for use only if experience showed
it to be necessary.

14.

(i)

As regards police, the police authority would be
retained, but the powers of the Minister for Home
Affairs exercised by the Home Secretary.

These

powers are more extensive than those he has in
relation to provincial forces in England and Wales
(e.g.

in relation to appointments and discipline)

but less than those which he has in relation to the
Metropolitan Police.

(ii)

The main prison in Northern Ireland, Crumlin Road gaol,
does not at present hold any internees and the
treatment of ordinary prisoners is not a contentious

matter.

But the internment camps are run by the

Northern Ireland prison service and the Ministry of
Home Affairs, and it would not seem possible to deal
with them separately from the ordinary prisons.

The suggestion was made at the Ministers' meeting on

9th February that one possibility might be to entrust law and order
to a Governor having effective executive powers;

he would be

responsible to the United Kingdom Government, but the control would
remain a local one.

The main difficulty is that it seems

unacceptable that, at any rate for more than a very brief period,
responsibility for the main functions involved - control of the

which raise issues as to the rights and liberty of the subject

-

police, running the prisons, operating internment policy, all of

should be exercised without there being ultimate responsibility to
a democratically elected body;

and responsibility to the United

Kingdom Government would probably in the end turn out to be not very
much different than if there were a direct transfer to Westminster.
Concern with the police also involves close relationships with the

Army, and the position could become extraordinarily complicated if
there were a surviving Stormont Government;

a separate Northern

Ireland arm which took responsibility for (among other things) the
police;
matters.

and the continuing responsibility of the GOC for security
The arrangement would also look too much like a Colonial

set-up.

In any fresh plan for Northern Ireland, proposals for changes

in internment policy are clearly of the first importance, and would
be crucial to the reaction of others to the plan.

17.

It is difficult to be sure what scope there is for running down

internment since our knowledge of the case against individuals is
limited.

The present Advisory Committee under Judge Brown have asked

to be relieved of their duties by the end of March so that they
can resume their ordinary callings.

A new Committee, perhaps

headed by a more weighty figure than a Northern Ireland county
court judge, could be appointed sooner than the end of March
and given a directive that the policy was to run down internment
and that they were required to reduce the numbers, if necessary
by specified amounts over stated periods, selecting so far as
possible the less dangerous for release.

As a corollary to a run-down in the numbers at present

not a complete suspension of, further arrests under the Special
Powers Act.

This could perhaps be coupled with more

concentration on cases where a prosecution could be mounted.

This morning's Cabinet seemed to be moving towards agreement on
four points:(a)

The appointment of a separate Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

(b)

A referendum on the Border.

(c)

A beginning of a phasing out of internment.

(d)

The transfer of law and order to Westminster.

(a) was argued on merits;

and it is probably true that it is something

which could be done - and justified - regardless of whether there was a

But it is surely wrong to consider (b), (c) and (d) on the same plane

political initiative or not.

i.e. as steps which should be taken irrespective of a political initiative.
Thus, a referendum on the Border would be a ""bonus"" for the Protestants;
and, as such, it should not be conceded except in return for an assurance of
their co-operation in a programme of change designed to put them on equality
with the rest of the United Kingdom of which they profess to wish to be an
integral part.

Similarly, a phasing out of internment would represent a

major concession to the minority in the North and to Mr. Lynch in the South;
and it is therefore essentially a bargaining card, which should not be played
except in return for counter concessions in the wider political context.
Rather different considerations apply to a transfer of law and order to
Westminster.

Even if it were reluctantly accepted by Mr. Faulkner, it would

still leave responsibility awkwardly divided between Westminster and Stormont
since, although Westminster would gain control of the security forces,
would still retain such functions as housing,

education, etc.;

Stormont

and it is these

which are often the occasion for the grievances with which the security forces
have to deal.

And, if the transfer were not accepted by Mr. Faulkner,

progression to direct rule would be almost inevitable and very swift.

inclined to suppose - that the Government couldor would be wise to confine
action to the points listed above.

Once one has embarked on a process of

radical reform it acquires its own momentum,which it ought to be allowed to

develop to the full.
Is the next step some private discussion with Mr. Lynch in order to
try to establish whether,

in return for a concession on internment, he would

be prepared to take stronger action in the South and so help us to build up the
kind of political pressure which would compel Mr. Faulkner either to

co-operate in the wholesale reform which the Home Secretary advocates or
at least not to stand in its way?

The Cabinet should be under no illusion

about what this would entail - in manpower,

expenditure and political odium

both at home and abroad.
(f)

Finally, if the Cabinet decide to endorse the Home Secretary's

proposals, are they content with the consequential timetable?

The effective

choice lies between completing the legislation before Easter or not
introducing it until after Easter.

The Ministerial group were inclined at

their last meeting to favour the former course.

If so, and if one makes

the Government for inclusion.
And it starts from
this fact.
It is clear that no agreement will be
possible unless the package includes measures for
a progressive ending of internment, defined in terms
of imprisonment without trial or preferred charges.
Press reports indicate that this is bein considered
by the Government, and that once the releases begin,
their number and timing will depend upon the scaling
down of violence.
We can all understand the anxieties that the

progressive closure of Long Kesh and Magilligan will
create in the minds of all who fear an intensification
of violence.
I want the Government, therefore, to consider
this proposal:
They should announce their willingness
to carry through a policy to end imprisonment without
trial, by a phased programme of releases of every
detainee and internee except those against whom
criminal charges are preferred in the Courts.
They

should announce a date for this to begin, let us say,
at some point early in April.
They should further
announce their willingness for all-party talks, on an
open agenda, nothing barred that any of the parties
wished to have discussed.

This, I believe, would enable leaders of the
minority community in Northern Ireland, political
leaders, Church leaders, to use their influence
throughout the community to produce an offer that,
from the moment of the announcement, there would be
an undertaking that violence would cease, for one

INTERNMENT

Your letter of 29th February to Robert Andrew recorded
the informal meeting which the Prime Minister had with the
Defence Secretary and the CGS after GEN 47 on 28th February.
There is one point in it on which you would probably like our
comments - the extent to which the Army had information which
would enable them to say with confidence that those interned
were members of the IRA.
The information

on which recommendations

for internment

are made by the RUC Special Branch is naturally held by the
Special Branch themselves.
But a senior Army intelligence
officer has always had complete access to these records;
and
he is satisfied that, subject to two reservations, virtually
all the internees are IRA members.
The first is that three
of the internees cannot be assigned to specific appointments
in the IRA's order of battle, though the dossiers concerned
show that the Special Branch regard two of them as members of
the IRA and the third as having strong links with the IRA.
The other reservation is that one cannot entirely rule out the
possibility that in a few cases the information provided to
the Special Branch might have been prompted by personal
spite,
or something similar, on the part of the informants.
I am sending a copy of the letter to Brian

PUBLICLY A CERTAIN VIEW, BUT I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT IN JUST
SUCH AREAS MANY, MANY PEOPLE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE RID OF THE
THUGS WHO HAVE FOR TOO LONG OPPRESSED THEM.

",what if i were to listen now to mr hume and his colleagues and empty the camps tomorrow who can seriously imagine that in that situation they would be able to exert any influence for peace they would be swept aside by the triumphant gunman let us examine this business of internment being a recruiting sergeant for the ira its a good round phrase but it has little foundation in fact the interrogation of pecple recently taken into detention shows very clearly that it was the period immediately before internment  june july and early august  which brought the great upsurge in ira strength we are told too of a complete alienation of the catholic community it is not easy for people in many areas to express publicly a certain view but i have reason to know that in just such areas many many people are delighted to be rid of the thugs who have for too long oppressed them you may ask why it is as so many of the ira leaders are removed from the scene that the campaign continues it ccntinues  i believe  because of irresponsible speculation which encourages amongst the diminishing ranks of the terrorists the idea that they only have to keep it up a little  longer and resistance to their efforts will crumble that   the internees will be released that stormont will be abolished that a united ireland engineered by them and dominated by them will be just around the corner that is why it is vitally important  in whatever talk there is about  political moves  to make it clear that in no sense will the ira be allowed to win responsible political initiatives are of no interest to the ira what they want is surrender people throughout the united kingdom are beginning to appreciate that democracy  is at stake  a victory for terrorism in any part of the united kingdom would be a signal to every antidemocratic element in the nation that the fabric of democratic society is wide open to attack the main line of battle may at the moment lie through ulster but it is truly a national struggle and the whole british people must in a full realisation of what is at stake be determined to win it and if the ira see that determination  see it manifest in public opinion in the expressions of elected representatives in the action of the government  then they will come quickly to the realisation that it is pointless to continue then and only then can measures for the safety of the public be relaxed    is it i wonder just possible that our neighbours in the south  as they gaze at the empty and silent stands at lansdowne road rugby stadium or the deserted hotels once full of british tourists  may see at last how this poison infects them indeed there is the very source of the poison itself for it is in the south that the whole romantic violent bloodstained physical force tradition of irish republicanism has its home too many of their political leaders have been nurtured in that tradition to break fully free of it too many have honoured the graves of yesterdays assassins to be wholly resistant to todays they have shown no ability to understand or sympathise with a million of what they themselves claim to be their fellow irishmen what a strange form of fellowship it is to vote money for the financing of sedition to exercise the jurisdiction they claim outside their own territory only to encourage the most negative policies of abstentionism and civic irresponsibility we  have seen the vast crowd gathered in the heart of dublin to hear those very men who we well know are the prime movers of this campaign of violence in the north we have seen the gardai standing idly by  a phrase for ever to be associated with the name of mr lynch  while the british embassy burns is such a country in any real sense

already prohibit the making of any law or the exercise of any delegated executive
power which imposes a disability or confers an advantage on grounds of religion.
We believe that the most promising and practical course would be to examine these
provisions
(i)

with a view to re-enacting them with, perhaps, greater precision of
definition, as a Bill of Rights;

(ii)

providing therein for a quick and effective

access to the Courts to test

Finally, I come to the question of internment.

I have received on this issue

the clearest possible advice from the Army and Police,

My colleagus

which is embodied in the

even to secure some form of political or negotiating advantage, it would be quite
wrong to take action which would be contrary to the clear security advice.

17.

This does not, of course, mean that there are no useful steps which we can take
in relation to the internment issue. As you know, and as paragraph 10(4) of my
Memorandum points out, I am attracted to the idea of introducing at an early date a
form of legislation to replace the Special Powers, which would come into effect on an
appointed day after violence had ended, and would inter alia then place the power
of internment in suspense, to be subsequently invoked only on the declaration of a
State of Emergency. The detail of such legislation is now being discussed with the
Home Office.

We also propose, as you will see, to issue a much more comprehensive

explanation of the need for, and operation of, internment than we have done to date,
and the text of this is being considered at tomorrow's Joint Security Committee.
18.

I am, of course, most anxious that while internment lasts, as effective action
as possible will be taken to improve the conditions under which internees live,
including better welfare, educational and recreational facilities, with provision
for rehabilitation, including if possible the provision of training.

The extent to

which these facilities can be provided may, of course, be conditioned by two

factors - (a) security, and (b) the readiness of internees to avail of them.
19. Moreover, serious though the effect of internment has undoubtedly been in
hardening Catholic opinion, there are very real signs - in the view of those, like

1.

There has been considerable

speculation in the press about the possibility

of ending internment,

whether I saw any early prospects of its being phased out.

I replied that

shared the view of the Army that it was vital to get on top of the IRA before
making any move in this direction.
2.

In spite of the continued bombings and shootings there is ample evidence

that the effectiveness of the IRA,especially in the Belfast area where the
security forces have recently concentrated their efforts, has been very
seriously reduced.

The removal from circulation of 700 - 800 members of the

two main organizations is creating increasing problems for them in terms both
of morale and losses of key personnel.

These losses have to some extent been

made good, but the officers of some companies have had to be replaced two or
three times over and volunteers are now reluctant to come forard.

Several

areas have been completely cleared of IRA and increasing pressure is being
brought to bear on areas where groups are still active.
3.

In Belfast the IRA are particularly short of leadership, experience and

technical skill in the use of explosives.

Taking the situation in Northern

Ireland as a whole, about 140 important members on the wanted list are now in
the Irish Republic.

on the security forces and of maintaining limited attacks on civilian targets
for some time to come, especially outside Belfast.
4.

There are two answers to the claim that internment has not worked.

The first is the fact, already noted, that the IRA presence has been removed
from certain areas and that this is continuing;

though it is unfortunately true

that those who have most to fear from the IRA are least articulate in pointing
to the comparative freedom from intimidation which they are beginning to enjoy.

Secondly,

insofar as internment has not yet succeeded, this is due in no small

measure to the fact that there are many people outside the IRA who do not want
it to work.

They include those who while ostensibly deploring the methods of

the IRA have little desire to see the IRA put out of action until some at least
of the organization's aims have been achieved.
There is little evidence that internment has led to a substantial increase

6.

In spite of successes against the IRA it may still be claimed that the present

strategy of attrition offers steadily diminishing returns in terms of opportunities
for a political settlement.

It may indeed appear to some that efforts to secure

a settlement cannot await the prior defeat of the IRA, or even the scaling down of
violence to an acceptable level, and that there are greater chances of terminating
violence by putting internment into reverse than by pursuing it to the bitter end.
In pursuit of this argument it might be argued that internees should now be released
at the rate of, say, 50 per month and that the rate might be increased as the
situation improved;

conversely that it should be cut back if there were no

improvement, and that all releases should stop if a further deterioration occurred.
Alternatively there might be a programme of releases geared to the progress of talks
with the Northern Ireland opposition.

The possibility of phasing out internment

in this way has been studied, but is open to the following objections:(1)

All internees are, on the evidence available, either members of the IRA or

otherwise involved in terrorism, and there is no pool of mere political activists
from which releases can be made.

There is, therefore, the likelihood that internees

released as a political gesture would return to their previous activities and so
repair the substantial damage which has been inflicted on both factions of the IRA
since 9 August 1971.
(2)

If internees were released prematurely, ie before the IRA were defeated,

the

prime targets for retaliatory action would undoubtedly be the members of the
Special Branch of the RUC:

these are for the most part known to those internees

whom they have arrested or interrogated.
(3)

The IRA would regard any programme of release for political reasons as an

important success.

It would also be so regarded by members of the Security Forces

and the general public.

The IRA could, therefore, dictate future terms.

Any decision to make no further arrests would be regarded by the IRA as a still
they could be expected to take the opportunity to recoup
greater achievement;
(4)

their losses and to equip themselves to intensify operations at a date of their own
choosing.
(5)

Those on the run would be encouraged to return to their units.

The process of internment has provided, and continues to provide, a flow

intelligence on the membership, resources and plans of the IRA.

of

If this flow were

interrupted the IRA could re-group with impunity.
7.

The Joint Security Committee have noted these conclusions and have accepted

Any other course would it is felt carry with it

a serious risk of the prolongation of the terrorist campaign.
8.

It is difficult to visualize any solid advantages which might outweigh

these security objections.

It may well be that internment continues to be the

main cause of Catholic alienation and that it has attracted to the IRA the sympathy
of sections of the Catholic population which would otherwise have no use for
ut it can hardly be supposed that the confidence of the minority

on back by letting the gunman loose to reimpose their will in areas

from which they have been expelled.

9.

Nor is

it

easy to see how the ending of internment before the IRA are

defeated can in any way assist towards a political solution.

The opposition

have no control over the IRA and therefore no means of bringing terrorism itself
And even if a total or partial ending of internment enabled

under control.

political talks to start a fully armed terrorist organization in the background
with its ranks re-filled would inevitably dominate the course of any negotiations.
10.

If it is accepted that there is no painless way of ending internment it

will be necessary to say so publicly and to face the unfavourable reactions which
will inevitably follow.In order to minimize these reactions certain steps can,
-

however, be taken
(1)

The need for internment to continue may have to be spelt out more

effectively.

For this purpose it is proposed to give as much publicity as possible

to a general defence of the policy and to the correcting of some of the grosser
forms of misrepresentation to which it has been subjected.

It may also be possible

to include proposals for ending internment as soon as the IRA campaign ceases.
(2)

There will be greater stress on the easing of conditions under which

internees live, including better welfare facilities and provision for rehabilitation.

(3)

Amending Regulations have already been drafted and will shortly be made

which will remove some criticism of existing procedures as being too arbitrary.
(4)

As indicated in a separate memorandum, legislation is under consideration

which would have the effect of putting the Special Powers Acts into suspense on
termination of the present emergency.

In his letter of 1 March Mr Faulkner deals at some length with

had circulated to his Cabinet.

TRANSFER OF PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE REPUBLIC
12.

Mr Faulkner records his conclusion that to attempt to ease the

security problem by transferring parts of the Province to the Republic
would create more problems than it would solve.
FURTHER CONSULTATION

13.

Mr Faulkner stresses in his letter of 16 February that it is his

understanding and that of his colleagues that ""... any new, albeit

provisional, conclusions reached by the United Kingdom

Government will

be put to our Cabinet for our consideration and comment before any
concrete action is taken or any public disclosure made"".

He repeats

the point in a different form in his letter of 1 March.

We know from

contacts at official level that Stormont Ministers will not be slow to
complain if they can assert that they were faced with a fait accompli.
SUMMARY
14.

Mr Faulkner's proposals,with the exception of a pretty tightly

drawn referendum ammount

to a development, not in itself without

merit, of his present ideas for changes as set out in his Green Paper.
The Northern Ireland Parliament continues with its present range of
functions and responsibilities; Westminster assumes no new role in the
Province and responsibility for law and order stays as it is; representatives of the minority community are not to be brought into Government
except on invitation of the Prime Minister; any change in internment
policy is stoutly resisted;

there are proposals for closer association

with the Republic but they have no real chance of acceptance in the South.

while Stormont would retain the power in other areas of
administration which are often the occasion of the grievances
which threaten law and order.

If the transfer were limited even

more narrowly, i.e. to internment alone, there would be the
additional complication of dividing the allegiance of the RUC.
(b)

It would be very doubtfully worth it in terms of the probable result.
The minority in the North would be unlikely to offer their
co-operation if Stormont were left in existence in any form
or to any extent;

and we could expect little from Mr.

Lynch,

if he were offered merely a referendum on the Border (the outcome
of which would be predictably in favour of the Protestants) and a
transfer of law and order to Westminster unaccompanied by any
guarantee of greater minority participation in the Government at

proscribed the IRA in Great Britain at the same time.

If the

package also included an undertaking progressively to ease
internment,

the position might be rather different.

But an

easing of internment might not outweigh the proscription of
the IRA.
(c)

And in any case could Mr. Faulkner stand it?

It would probably be more sustainable politically than the Home
Secretary's proposals - both as giving less offence to the
Government's supporters at Westminster and as involving
less risk of a Protestant backlash in Ulster.

But even this

cannot be assumed too lightly - especially if internment were
relaxed as part of the deal.
(5)

The Cabinet must face up to this choice and decide which way they

wish to go.

And the longer they defer a decision, the more vulnerable they

will be to the charge of doing too little too late.

In any event it will not be

possible to postpone some overt indication of the Government's intentions
beyond this week;

and the most probable timetable now seems to envisage

a Government statement in the next few days to the effect that Mr. Faulkner
(?

with some of his colleagues) is being invited to London for discussions

next week.

We cannot move more quickly, since it is now essential to get

President Pompidou's visit and the Budget out of the way before running into

Dr. O'Connell was prepared

to go ahead on this basis.
He had had discussions with leaders of the I.R.A. and with Dr. Paisley.
The proposal which had emerged from these discussions was that the I.R.A.
would declare that

they were calling off the campaign of violence on the

understanding that after 30 days of peace, internment would be ended and a
week thereafter talks would begin.

3840,IMG_7110_PREM_15_1004,"that they were calling off their campaign without making public the agreement
that 30 days later the British Government would respond by ending internment.
In response to my question about what would happen if talks broke down, Dr.
O'Connell said that the I.R.A. were prepared to agree in advance a minimum
period during which discussions could continue without their resuming
violence;

in his discussion with the leadership three months had been

mentioned first, and six months had been quite easily agreed.

The I.R.A.

were particularly anxious to establish a place for themselves at the
conference table.
Dr. O'Connell was very vague about the solution which should emerge
from the talks, but he was clearly thinking in terms of a move towards a
united Ireland.

The I.R.A. want an Ulster Parliament, for nine counties,

which would be one of several, looking eventually to an all-Ireland Parliament.
Dr. O'Connell said he had persuaded them to accept that agreement to discuss
a united Ireland at the talks, without a prior commitment to it, was acceptable
Also on the agenda for talks should be ""an amnesty for political
-prisoners"".

By this Dr. O'Connell meant people imprisoned in Great Britain

for offences involving obtaining arms for the I.R.A., as well as marchers
subject to a mandatory six-month sentence.

More important, Dr. O'Connell

was looking to a phased withdrawal of British troops.

It was difficult to

The emphasis was more on getting them off the

streets so that their presence was similar to that of troops in England and
Wales rather than leaving Northern Ireland without any armed forces whatever.
Dr. O'Connell was clearly thinking towards a united Ireland, but he
accepted that reform of Stormont giving a guaranteed place for the minority

in the Government might serve as an interim arrangement, leading to a united
Ireland by agreement.

policy against the I.R.A. in the Republic.
in the end in their interests to do so:

It is of course

the official wing

of the I.R.A. is as great a threat to the Irish Government
as it is to Stormont.
It is necessary also to have regard to public opinion
in Britain.

I do not need to remind Your Majesty that

Ireland has a long history in British politics, and it is
important that any political initiative which is taken
should command as wide as possible a measure of support in
this country, and especially in Parliament.

It seems likely that among the ingredients of any
political initiative should be the appointment of a new
Secretary of State in the British Government, to take over
from the Home Secretary his present responsibility for
Northern Ireland affairs, some indication that the policy
of internment is being wound down (so that there is a
prospect of increasing releases as and when violence dies
down), and probably the transfer of responsibility for

law and order from Stormont to Westminster.

This last

ingredient, however, is likely to be particularly
controversial in Northern Ireland.

It is not clear whether

Your Majesty's present Ministers in Northern Ireland would
be prepared to continue to serve, if they no longer had

I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the

particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics,
or your religion.

suffering to an end, because the United Kingdom, Parliament and government

No single measure can overcome the bitterness of the past few years
the bitterness, indeed of far too much of Northern Ireland's history.
The government have concluded, after long and anxious thought, that we must
make possible a completely fresh start; and so we have worked out a set
of proposals to provide this fresh star, the fresh start which is needed
if we are to break out of the vicious circle of violence and yet more
violence.
Last Wednesday I put these proposals to Mr. Faulkner:
1:

That the United Kingdom government should take over
responsibility for law and order in Northern. Ireland

2:

That there should be a gradual reduction in
internment, beginning with those internees who could be released
without unacceptable risks.

3:

That the people of Northern Ireland should be
given a chance as soon as it is practicable and again at intervals
later, to decide for themselves in a plebiscite whether or not they
want to remain in the United Kingdom.

In the United Kingdom we have a fully effective

One of the problems in Northern Ireland has been the

organisation of political parties on a sectarian basis which has
in turn meant a permanent one-party majority in the Northern Ireland
Parliament.

In Northern Ireland there has not been the same

confidence in all sections of the community in the Parliamentary

I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: and in particular to the people of

Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion.
All of us have been horrified by the violence in Northern Ireland and by
the suffering it has caused.

As a Government we have been doing everything in

our power to bring that violence and that suffering to an end.

Because the

United Kingdom Parliament and Government have the same duty towards the people
of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country - to protect their lives and

Third, that the people of Northern Ireland should be given a chance as soon

These were the proposals which I put to Mr. Faulkner on Wednesday.

We

had hoped that he and his colleagues might see their way to accepting them.

I

was very sorry when he told me that he and his colleagues could not continue
as the Government of Northern Ireland if responsibility for law and order were
transferred to Westminster.

But we believe that nothing less than the proposals

I have described would enable us to break out of the deadlock of the last few
months.

The Government here in London is therefore obliged to take over for

the time being full responsibility for the conduct of affairs in Northern Ireland.
The Army will stay in Northern Ireland as long as any faction seeks to terrorise
or intimidate ordinary people.

Internment:

First Alternative

As soon as responsibility has been transferred an immediate review

will be put in hand by this Government of all internment orders with a view
to revoking as many of them as possible consistent with public safety.
The Government have taken this decision after consultation with their
military advisers.

They have also consulted the Prime Minister of

Northern Ireland who agrees with this course.

The pace of releases will

depend on the state of public security and the effect upon it of the release
of particular internees whose cases are under review.

release;

The more quickly

the more rapid will be the pace of

but any increase in IRA activity will delay the process.

Internment: Second Alternative
7.

It is Her Majesty's Government's intention to release as soon as

possible those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt
as to the danger to security that their release would pose.

Their release

will be conditional on an undertaking not to take part in or encourage
violence or illegal action.
8.

It is hoped that upwards of /about/ 100 internees can be said to be

in this category,

and it is hoped to release them during the next few weeks.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is establishing immediately a

procedure to review each case personally.
9.

If the measures which Her Majesty's Government have taken lead,

as is hopedthey will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible
to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly
established improvement in the security situation.
10.

It is Her Majesty's Government's clear intention to bring

as long as active terrorism persists and bombing and

Her Majesty's Government must retain the power to

12.

This Government,

and its predecessors,

have given solemn and

repeated assurances that the position of Northern Ireland as part of the
United Kingdom will not be changed without the consent of the people of
Northern Ireland.

We have decided that it would now be appropriate if

arrangements were made for the views of the people of Northern Ireland
to be made known on this question from time to time.

We therefore

propose in due course to invite the House to provide for a system of
regular plebiscites about the Border, the first to be held as soon as
practicable in the near future and others at intervals of a substantial
period of years thereafter.
in substitution for,

The plebiscites will be in addition to,

the provisions in the Ireland Act,

the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament to any change in the Border.

These,

Mr. Speaker, are our immediate proposals.

But they do not

in themselves constitute in the view of Her Majesty's Government a lasting
solution for the problems of Northern Ireland.

Means must still be found

which will ensure for the whole community an active,

permanent and

guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of the Province.

Our

immediate proposals are put forward in the hope that they will so change

the climate of political opinion in Northern Ireland that discussions can be
resumed in an effort to reach agreement on a new way forward to this end;
and it is our intention,

as soon as circumstances permit,

to promote the

necessary consultations about the future structure of Government in
Northern Ireland.

14.

I would like to pay tribute to the strength of conviction with which

the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has maintained his point of view
throughout all our discussions.

It is amatter of deepest regret to

Her Majesty's Government that we were unable to reach a final agreement.
In the last resort, however, responsibility rests with the United Kingdom
Government and Parliament;

and we should be abdicating that responsibility

My personal assessment of the Irish Government
reaction to the three possibilities in telegram No. 98
is as follows:(1)

unacceptble for the same reason - too little and
too late;

(2)

acceptable, because they believe that in practice
it would prove not very different from (3);

(3)

would be acceptable.
I believe that if the Irish liked the rest of our

taking care of the reunification question if, without

changing the substance of our attitude we were able to
phrase it in a slightly more forthcomin manner.
However, I must stress that the Irish Government and
public opinion would regard both (2) and (3) as the
necessary preliminary to our tackling the real issue,
which in their view is how to obtain a political settlement
in which the Catholics need no longer feel they are
second class citizens.

It is this issue which in their

view will determine whether the bombing and violence cease.
There are some indications that the Provisional IRA
leadership might be prepared to call off the campaign of
violence even though their extreme demands - the abolition
of Stormont, the release of all internees and ""political

prisoners"" and the withdraal of the British Army from
Northern Ireland - were not met.

You might speak on the following lines:In the first few months following the
introduction of internment on 9 August the IRA
terrorism was fairly effective.

By November

however the Army's tactics began to have an impact.
In January the Government were able to contemplate
a situation arising in the spring or early summer
when the IRA's hold over the Catholic minority
(except in London-derry) would have been loosened
to the point where it might have become possible
to hold talks of the kind envisaged by the Home
Secretary in his statement of 7 September.
Londonderry administered a shock to opinion
throughout Ireland.

This, and the sequel at Newry,

created a new situation in which direct intervention
by H.M. Government became a possibility.

Ministers therefore set to work urgently to
consider whether this possibility was real and if

so how it could best be exploited.

Early in the

process which then ensued Ministers came to the
conclusion that the effect of Londonderry on public
opinin made it not only possible but in fact
desirable for the Government to intervene.

The

post-Londonderry situation provided an opportunity
by direct intervention to break the circle of

violence and make a new start.

that the Government of Northern Ireland would cease to be

then his release must imply that that danger is no longer

This means that he cannot be reinterned unless

deteriorated.

But it also implies a need for care in any

of view of danger to the public safety, then the moment
some of them are released the continued detention of the

of the Northern Ireland Office of individual cases with
the object of dividing category C. into those who can be

Such an oath or declaration is important for two
reasons.

Firstin order to counter the accusation from

the RUC and others that we are releasing men who have
given no undertaking that they would not immediately rejoin
the active ranks ofthe IRA.

Secondly, that if in fact

they do so, the case for re-interning them is very much
stronger.

The words ""for the remainder of my life"" might

be omitted.
Consideration of the pre-release undertaking does,
however, raise the question whether the releases should be
conditional or absolute.

Regulation 12 already empowers

the Minister of Home Affairs to make conditions of residence
and reporting to the police and the like as an alternative
to internment.

If we took over internment, we could

further modify the Regulation (and indeed it is understood
that the Northern Ireland Government themselves had the

possibility of a provision for conditional release in mind
in any revision of the Regulations).

But if under the

existing Regulation internment were converted to a

residence and reporting condition in the case of individuals
it would seem to carry the advantage that the individuals
would not cease to be persons judged to be a danger to
public safety.

Whether conditions would be enforceable

question

OF STATE, MR WILLIAM WHITELAW, AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN
STORMONT CASTLE ON FRIDAY 7 APRIL 1972

A few days ago,when I first came here I called for an end to violence

and

asked for everyone to work for peace.
Since then on all sides I have been struck by the will to end this tragic
period in Northern Ireland's history and to move forward again.
I have been encouraged by the willingness to think again by those who may
have reacted strongly to the measures which were so recently taken by

Her Majesty's Government.

Equally I have been impressed by the courage

of those who have been prepared to speak up against the law of the gun.
So it is right that you should ask what My contribution is going to be.
Without doubt a key issue is internment.

Let no-one be under any illusion.

The people who are behind the wire were put there because of the dangerous

situation confronting this community in the recent past.
But in this new mood of peace and reconciliation I have now decided it
would be right for me to release some of the men interned immediately.
As I promised I have begun to review personally the cases of the 728 people
still interned under the Special Powers Act.

This of course takes time.

Initially I have looked at those cases which the security authorities have
advised might be considered for early release and last night I signed
Orders authorising the release of 47 internees.

It did not seem to me to

be right to delay the release of any internees until I had been able to
complete my review of every case.

I shall now proceed as quickly as

possible to review the remaining cases and intend to authorise the release

of any whom I consider suitable as soon as I have completed each one.
The internees released today were not asked to give an undertaking about
their future behaviour.

Affairs department

and from the military have convinced me that a ship is not suitable for such

I have therefore decided that the ship will cease to be a

reception centre for detainees.
A number of detainees from the Maidstone are of course included in the
figures I have already announced for release.

But within the next few days

There are several other questions which it may be convenient to

deal with tomorrow, if there is time:(i)

The arrangements for the immediate appointment of a

Thursday evening.

(ii)

The appointment of the Advisory Commissionon which the
Lord President should put forward proposals as quickly as
possible.

It might be helpful if the Commission could be

fully established before the end of the Easter recess.
(iii)

The scope and timing of the first releases of internees, where
it might be useful to ask the Lord President if he has yet
been able to give any thought to the procedure for initiating
a review.

Sooner or later the Government will be challenged

in Parliament about the criteria governing the rate of release
and the selection of individuals;

and we ought to decide these

as soon as possible.
(iv)

The cratering of Border roads, where the Lord President
is inclined to favour some degree of unobtrusive relaxation,
particularly if there are grounds for hoping that this might
lead to closer co-operation between the RUC and the Gardai.
Mr. Lynch's reply to your message suggests that he might be
responsive to a discreet gesture of this kind.

The parades at the week-end were handled satisfactorily.

that Protestants will attempt to set up permanent barricades this week-end.
The spread of this activity in towns outside Belfast and Londonderry creates
difficulties for the security forces.
ARREST POLICY

The arrest of eight men last night, four of whom were on a 'wanted' list,

raises the question in what circumstances such arrests should be made.

Three of

The Northern Ireland Office will arrange for the subject to

be considered by the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland.

The policy regarding leading notables in theIRA such as John Stephenson

is that they should be arrested if that is possible without causing
disproportionate disorder, even if no evidence of a criminal offence is
available.

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMARY FOR THE PERIOD
19 MAY - 24 MAY, 1972
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office

GENERAL
The period has again seen attempts to set up Protestant ""no-go"" areas
in Belfast, but these were contained by the security forces with the
assistance of the local inhabitants. Explosions remain low in number if not
in intensity though shooting incidents continue with both military and
civilian casualties. There have been demonstrations by Catholics in
Londonderry against IRA violence.
Mr Faulkner has invited Mr Craig to join a Unionist committee on a new
2.
constitution for Northern Ireland, while in the Republic, Mr Lynch has
announced his intention of strengthening the laws against illegal
organisations.
THE REPUBLIC
There have been several instances of incendiary devices being found in
3.
Dublin stores, though so far no serious injury has been caused, although
there was some damage to property.
4.
The fact that some of the prisoners involved in the Mountjoy Prison
riot have been removed to the Curragh has led to charges that internment is
being introduced by theback door, but this was denied by the Minister for
Justice, Mr O'Malley.

MR LYNCH
5.
In Dublin on Monday, Mr Lynch said that he intended to ask the
Government to consider how the laws against illegal organisations could be
strengthened. The Government was determined to ensure that private armies
would not use the Republic as a base. The Irish Government had welcomed
the British initiative in the North and Mr Whitelaw's efforts to bring
peace, but extremists of both communities tried to frustrate Mr Whitelaw's
efforts. Current IRA activities were postponing community reconciliation
in the North and ultimate Irish unity.

The SDLP representatives said that they realised that the

long as four weeks.
In further discussion the Secretary of State said that if violence

At least for presentational reasons it might be necessary for

some of the internees to be detained and charged in the normal way.
The SDLP representatives said that in their view this would be
disastrous.

The establishment of the Provisionals had been a

spontaneous reaction by the Catholic community to the events of 1969.
There would be no real peace unless the internees were finally
released.

They were confident that if the internees were released on

the ending of violence, violence would not be resumed.

to everyone else. He had given the Protestant community repeated
assurances on the Border; but they remained anxious for their position
to be understood. They also wanted assurances that the security forces
were prepared actively to pursue gunmen. The ""no go"" areas in
Londonderry were a continuing affront to the Protestant community
although many of them failed to appreciate the issues and had never
been to Londonderry. In his talkswith the UDA he had made it clear
that a military operation in the ""no go"" areas would be possible, but

that this would result in serious casualties and in particular would
lead to bitterness that would last many years.

He had also made it

clear that the withdrawal of social security benefits would be
undesirable. He had not ruled out the possibility of a defensive
cordon around the ""no go"" areas to prevent terrorists from using it
as a haven from which to carry on their activities.
In discussion on the ending of violence the SDLP representatives said
that the Provisionals would not respond to pleas or argument; they
needed to be exposed to political pressures. If the Secretary of State
took the risk of a complete end to internment the pressures on the
Provisionals to end violence would be irresistible. There would then

also be an opportunity to end civil disobedience and to undertake
positive talks on the opening of the ""no go"" areas. It was a risk worth
taking. The Secretary of State said that he could not risk ending
internment without an end of violence. If major acts of terrorism took
place after the ending of internment his position would be impossible. If
there were a genuine end of terrorism,even for a limited period, there
would be a genuine response from the Governmentand,subject to consul-

tations with his colleagues, he did not rule out the ending of internment
in these circumstances.
In discussion on the ""no go"" areas of Londonderry the SDLP said that the
problem was essentially political. There was no difficulty in entering
the areas, many people did so without harrassment every day. The

They did not directly challenge the accuracy of this as
their position. Turning to the specific matters which they
raised I said that the Secretary of State could not concede
the demand for political status for convicted prisoners.
Quite apart from any other considerations, this was not a
concept known to the law and the Secretary of State could
therefore not give effect to it. He was however prepared to
consider representations from any quarter about specific
matters affecting the treatment of prisoners and had in fact
already made certain arrangements which were sufficiently
satisfactory to the prisoners themselves for them to have
called off their hunger strike as had been announced on the
news. I suggested that the substance of what was being asked
for under this head was virtually the position as it now was.
6.
Mr O'Connell said that he broadly accepted this, but
there was some doubt as to whether the report that the hunger
strike had been called off was true. He asked if I would at
once telephone the Governor of Belfast Prison and ask for a
named prisoner to come to the telephone to give a personal
report to Mr O'Connell on whether or not the hunger strike
had been called off.
I pointed out that it had been agreed that our meeting
7.
should be completely secret and that for me to do what he
asked would cause an immediate leak and that there was no
prospect that he would be able to get the Governor to bring
the prisoner to the telephone to talk to Mr O'Connell.
8.
I then turned to the second question which had been
put - if a cease fire were called would the Secretary of State
stop the harassment of the Provisional IRA. I said that
harassment was a vague term and meant different things to
different people. After discussion of various examples I
said that it seemed that what the two representatives were
asking for was an assurance that the security forces would
not take the opportunity of a cease fire to pick up men whom
they had been unable to get while the campaign was on. They
agreed that this was their position and I said that the
Secretary of State was prepared to give an assurance on this
point which would mean that raids, searches and arrests to

look for people wanted for their past activities would not
take place. They raised one subsidiary point; many members
of their organisation remained in fear of being attacked and
had been accustomed to carrying concealed side-arms. If they
were stopped and found to be carrying arms would they be
arrested? I said that this was a question which I would report
back but that the object was to produce a situation as soon as
possible when people no longer thought they needed to carry
firearms and that if persons were going about on normal
peaceful business they would not be subject to arbitrary
stopping and searching.

Nevertheless, the meeting may

wish to discuss some of the following points which it raised in the
context of the more conciliatory atmosphere which should prevail if the
Secretary of State's political initiative goes well:(a)

The Criminal Law
The Attorney General's memorandum discloses a disturbing
state of affairs.

In particular it is becoming increasingly urgent

to:(i)

secure from the RUC the report of their investigation
of the most recent allegations of ill-treatment.

Why

is this taking so long?
(ii)

ensure that instructions are issued to the RUC on the
importance of distinguishing between the type of questioning
appropriate to a prisoner against whom charges are likely
to be brought in court and the type appropriate when the
object is simply to secure intelligence.

(The actual

conduct of interrogation for intelligence purposes will
be discussed later in the meeting.)
We have also to decide whether, given the Attorney General's
judgment that some 30 pending prosecutions will have to be
abandoned, the persons concerned should be re-arrested under
the Special Powers Act (paragraph 4).
arrests on 9th August,

Several of those whose

1971, were judged invalid on purely

technical grounds were immediately re-arrested under a valid
formula.

To re-arrest persons against whom prosecutions

had been pending but had been dropped might, however, be open
to wider criticism in so far as there was evidently no case to
back up the suspicion upon which the individual had been arrested.
On the other hand, what will be the reaction of ""Loyalists"" to
the release of detainees on what will be said to be mere legal
technicalities, comparable to those on which known terrorists
have repeatedly been discharged in the Republic?

4426,IMG_7696_PREM_15_1009,"(b)

The Legal Position of the Security Forces
The Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and for Defence
might be asked whether they are content with the Attorney
General's proposals in paragraphs 10 and 11 that he should
normally authorise prosecutions in cases involving physical
assault or ill-treatment of persons in custody by members of
the security forces but that he would regard as special cases
reasonable actions to preserve law and order (for example,
in particular cases,

shooting to prevent the escape of a person

whom soldiers are justified in attempting to arrest).

The

Attorney General might also be asked when he proposes to
introduce the Order in Council permitting sittings of the
Belfast Crown Court during August (paragraph 12).
(c)

Special Courts
Do Ministers endorse the Attorney General's clear conclusion in
paragraph 18 that there is no advantage in courts with a special
composition (without jurors) exercising the ordinary criminal
law?

Do they also endorse his implied preference (paragraph 21)

for not instituting tribunals with special procedures going beyond
the present criminal law and rules of evidence?

The Attorney

General presumably judges that, although such tribunals might
be a more ""judicial"" alternative to the Secretary of State's
powers under the Special Powers Acts,

their establishment would

be seen as a further special measure indicating that the normal

judicial
(d)

structure of the Northern Ireland State was inadequate.

The Civil Law
Do Ministers endorse the Attorney General's view:-

(i)

that, as regards the three (substantial) claims in respect
of injuries suffered during deep interrogation, we should
resist pressure for disclosure of documents about the
instructions given and the techniques used (paragraph 23);

(ii)

that claims for death or injuries in the Londonderry
incident should be dealt with in the light of the forthcoming
opinion of the Law Officers upon the Crown's legal liability;

(iii)

that claims for wrongful arrest or false imprisonment, where
there is no question of brutality, should be settled;

proceedings in domestic courts and the proceedings at Strasbourg.

the Strasbourg hearings;

current position.

concerned should specifically consider whether they regarded it as

are involved, the JIG have reaffirmed their view that there would be no
ultimate objection to publication;

opportunity to check whether they endorse this view in political terms.

ACT OF INDEMNITY

Note by Officials
Precedents of Acts of Indemnity
1.

The earlier precedents do not help since they relate to an obsolete

method of dealing with disturbances, ie byan enactment suspending the
application of the Habeas Corpus Acts to those suspected of treasonable
practices (to allow arbitrary detention) followed at the expiry of the
suspension by an Act or Indemnity for acts done under cover of the
suspension.

The modern practice is to take wide powers (as in the N I

Special Powers Acts and Regulations) to enable the executive to detain
and take other steps to restore order.

As long as soldiers and officials

act within such powers they require no indemnity because the jurisdiction
of the courts is effectively excluded.

The question of indemnity only

arises when even the wide powers so conferred are exceeded,

eg by the use

of excessive force or failure to comply with legal requirements as to
arrest.

The only UK Acts of Indemnity enacted in recent times are the

Indemnity Act 1920 and the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity)
Act 1923.
2.

The 1923 Act has only a superficial relevance to the present situation

in Northern Ireland.

It did not deal with the ""troubles"" in Southern

Ireland and, in particular, with the acts there of the military under
General Macready which were the subject of much litigation in the Irish

courts until operations ceased with the 1922 Treaty.

No Act of Indemnity

was passed in relation to those operations.
3.

The 1923 Act had a strictly limited purpose.

The Home Secretary

(Mr Bridgeman) had continued, for a short period after Southern Ireland
had become the Irish Free State, to issue orders under the Restoration
of Order in Ireland Regulations for the arrest of persons in England and
their internment in Dublin (which involved their deportation).

The

Court of Appeal in the Art O'Brien case declared such orders invalid,
and the Irish Free State Government acceded to the Home Secretary's request
to make O'Brien available for release in England.

The objects of the

1923 Act were to relieve the Home Secretary from possible liability for
the (unpardonable) praemunire offences under the Habeas Corpus Act 1679
which he had arguably committed by sending British subjects in custody out
of the country without powers, and to avoid the embarrassment of further
applications in the English courts by those who had been the subject of

But the Act did

not affect their right to challenge in the Irish courts the validity of
the order of the appropriate Froe State Minister under which they were
currently detained.

4.

The 1920 Act restricted the right to take legal proceedings in

respect of acts done in good faith during the 1914-18 war in execution
or purported execution of duty or for the defence of the realm or the
public safety or otherwise in the public interest by a person holding
office or employed under the Crown or any person acting under the authority
of a person so holding office or employed.

An act was to be deemed to have

been done in good faith unless the contrary was proved.

It seems from an

Irish case on an eighteenth century indemnity enactment that a good faith
provision would allow proceedings for bodilymaltreatment.
The 1920 Act did not affect proceedings on behalf of the Crown, and so did
not affect public prosecutions.

A right to compensation assessed by a

tribunal was given for some types of loss suffered by a person whose
rights of action were restricted.
There were a few similar local enactments following disturbances overseas
in the 1920's and the 1930's, eg in Jamaica, Palestine and Cyprus.
Timing and scope of Act of Indemnity
5.

There are obvious objections to the enactment of a general indemnity

before order has been restored and all detainees released.

To legislate

to prevent those still detained from taking proceedings to challenge any

invalidity in an internment order would be to return in effect to the
regime of arbitrary imprisonment without trial under cover of a suspension
of the Habeas Corpus Acts.

The draft Bill prepared for the last N I

Government suffered from this vice since it would have prevented any
proceedings, civil or criminal, in respect of anything purporting to have
been done under Regulations 10 to 13 of the Special Powers Regulations or
in carrying out any order made under then (thus covering internment and
detention orders and interrogation).

",such orders and were still detained in mountjoy prison  but the act did  not affect their right to challenge in the irish courts the validity of the order of the appropriate froe state minister under which they were currently detained  4  the 1920 act restricted the right to take legal proceedings in  respect of acts done in good faith during the 191418 war in execution or purported execution of duty or for the defence of the realm or the public safety or otherwise in the public interest by a person holding office or employed under the crown or any person acting under the authority of a person so holding office or employed  an act was to be deemed to have  been done in good faith unless the contrary was proved  it seems from an  irish case on an eighteenth century indemnity enactment that a good faith provision would allow proceedings for bodilymaltreatment the 1920 act did not affect proceedings on behalf of the crown and so did not affect public prosecutions  a right to compensation assessed by a  tribunal was given for some types of loss suffered by a person whose rights of action were restricted there were a few similar local enactments following disturbances overseas in the 1920s and the 1930s eg in jamaica palestine and cyprus timing and scope of act of indemnity 5  there are obvious objections to the enactment of a general indemnity  before order has been restored and all detainees released  to legislate  to prevent those still detained from taking proceedings to challenge any  invalidity in an internment order would be to return in effect to the regime of arbitrary imprisonment without trial under cover of a suspension of the habeas corpus acts  the draft bill prepared for the last n i  government suffered from this vice since it would have prevented any proceedings civil or criminal in respect of anything purporting to have been done under regulations 10 to 13 of the special powers regulations or in carrying out any order made under then thus covering internment and detention orders and interrogation  
4430,IMG_7700_PREM_15_1009,"6.

It is questionable too whether such an Let should bar public

prosecutions.

The 1920 Act excepted proceedings taken by the Crown.

The 1923 Act did bar criminal proceedings, but this was essential to free
the Home Secretary from any possible liability for the praemunire

offence.

The colonial precedents covered criminal proceedings, but were restricted
to acts done in good faith.

It would not be easy in those days to defend

a provision which barred criminal proceedings for some gross form of
violence in carrying into effect an order under the Special Powers
Regulations.
International aspects
7.

An Act of Indemnity would be likely to have a serious effect on our

prospects in the pending cases at Strasbourg.

An indemnity which

prevented those still detained from taking legal proceedings to challenge
their detention would be a breach of Article 5 of the Convention and,
unlike internment itself,

could hardly be justified as ameasure of

derogation required by the exigencies of the emergency situation.
Similarly, an Act barring the right to prosecute soldiers who had committed
unlawful acts of shooting would probably be regarded as a breach of

Article 2 which provides that everyone's right to life is to be protected
by law;

and it might also give rise to new proceedings under Article 6

and Article 13.

Moreover, any form of indemnity which appreciably

abridged existing domestic remedies in respect of the breaches of the
Convention alleged in the current complaints would undermine our case at
the admissibility stage which is largely based on the existence and
adequacy of those remedies, and might have an adverse effect at the
merits stage.
8.

Even if the Strasbourg cases were disposed of by a finding that the

United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under one or more of the
Articles of the Convention, that would not strengthen the case for an Act
of Indemnity in respect of the acts of the soldiers and officials concerned.
Such an Act could not expunge our international breach, and any
satisfaction that might fall to be made to an injured party in accordance
with the Convention would be the responsibility of the Government and be
made out of public funds.

introduced unless a pressing need arises on security or other policy

An Act which went no

further than to bar private prosecutions and transfer existing compensation
jurisdiction from the courts to adinistrative tribunals for security
reasons would probably not raise the sae problems, either in Parliament
or at Strasbourg, that would be raised by abridging the existing remedies
in the way proposed in the draft N I Bill which confined compensation to
cases involving bodily injury.

But no need seems to arise at present

for any forn of indemnity provision.

Unless we are confronted with a

spate of private prosecutions or civil actions giving rise to security or
other possible problems, it would be best to consider whether an Indemnity
Act is appropriate when order has been restored,

and the work of

reconstruction and reconciliation has been started;

that would be the

most suitable time for the enactment of any Indemnity Act.

In that

situation there is a more persuasive case for a once for all enactment
which will cover appropriate cases over the whole period of the

When the Daily Express article to this effect appeared
on 2nd June, we at once checked with Headquarters Northern
Ireland exactly what was known on the point.
The answer
was that there were reports of varying reliability that up to
25 (of 380 or so who had been released by them) had returned to
more or less active membership of the IRA - which did not
necessarily mean that they had themselves become active terrorists
again.
This is obviously a very much smaller proportion than
the one-quarter alleged by the Daily Express.
HQNI confirmed
that none of their officers had given any figures on the subject
to the Express (which did not actually attribute this one-quarter
theory to a military spokesman).
You will be aware that Mr. Whitelaw made some references to
this point in answering Questions on 8th June (Hansard, Cols.
678-9) and during the Debate on 12th June (Col. 1077).
We
consider that these references are a sufficient refutation of
the press reports, and that any further more direct action
might well be counter-productive.
Nevertheless, we shall use
any opportunity which presents itself to correct the mistaken
impression in these reports.

be chargeable if after arrest they were the subject
of a reasonably short and entirely lawful interrogation.

Third, there are about 80 terrorists, including most
of the key ones, against whom we are not in a position
to prefer charges of the normal sort partly because
they do not themselves indulge over much in specific
acts of terrorism, but rather organise them:
partly
because it is extremely difficult to get any evidence
against them which will stand up in a court of law:
and partly because the witnesses we might bring against
them would all be in danger of their lives.
In sum, we are in the position under the existing law
and powers whereby we cannot deal with the key
terrorists, even after we have caught them, other than
by internment.
And this, as you know, is a poison

4515,IMG_7785_PREM_15_1011,"Preventive Detention for Terrorist Conduct

The capacity of the Provisional IRA (or of any other
terrorist orgaisation) to engage in terrorism will not be
effectively destroyed until all its important members are
removed.

It will be possible to charge some with criminal

offences under the ordinary law;

but others and perhaps the

most important of them are beyond the reach of the criminal
law partly because witnesses cannot be expected to come
forward to give oral evidence in the ordinary way, and
partly because the evidence available to connect accused
persons with specific offences as opposed to general
complicity in terrorism is sometimes tenuous,particularly
in the case of the most important provisional IRA leaders.
Any action we take must be such as not to alienate the
minority community as a whole:

a consideration which must

rule out the further use of internment in the arbitrary form
which it now takes under the Special Powers Act.

The most promising possibility is to create a system
of special courts whose function would not be to convict
accused persons of

criminal offences, but to judge whether

they were guilty of certain specified conduct and commit
them to ""preventive detention"" if they were.

The Act

making this provision (as to the necessity of an Act see
below) could be of 6 months duration renewable by Order in
Council.

The provision would apply to conduct involving

Other points upon which Ministers may wish to be
satisfied before

making a decision are:(a)

The risk of heavy ""civilian"" casualties,

which we were formerly

advised would be inseparable from an operation to reoccupy the
Bogside and Creggan.
(b)

The use of armoured vehicles.

I understand that it is proposed

to use wheeled, not tracked, armoured personnel carriers;

but

that the AVRE (converted tanks) cannot be landed on the west bank
of the Foyle and must be driven up from Magilligan and across the
Craigavon Bridge - with a good deal of publicity as a result.
(c)

The use of heavy weapons.

I understand that the Secretary of State

for Defence envisages that Company Commanders should be
authorised to use Carl Gustav rocket launchers (such as have been
used to detonate bombs in cars) against premises from which heavy
firing is being directed against the security forces.

This may

entail substantial casualties?
8.

Paragraph 3 of the memorandum emphasises the importance of

reintroducing ""searches,

arrests, interrogation and some method of

keeping suspects in custody if there is insufficient evidence to convict

them in a court"".

This raises additional questions, of a rather different

kind:(d)

The scale of interrogation and the willingness of the RUC Special
Branch to conduct it.
in this respect;

They have recently become unco-operative

but the Attorney General hopes that the Special

Branch will accept his assurances that, provided that they adhere
to lawful methods of interrogation, they will have nothing to fear.
(e)

The responsibility for operational control of the RUC and Special
Branch in relation to security operations.

This question was

raised at the last meeting of GEN 79, when the Secretary of State
for Defence advocated that the responsibility should be transferred
to the GOC and the Director of Intelligence but the Secretary of
State was strongly opposed to this course on grounds of RUC
morale.
(f)

Internment or detention.

I understand that the Secretary of State

remains unwilling to reintroduce internment but may be prepared

to make detention orders for periods of up to 28 days on a fairly
wide scale;

and the Attorney General may say that the existing

provisions of the Special Powers Acts suffice to make this legal,
provided that interrogation is continued throughout this period.

OPERATIONS
There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes
and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces.

Since Operation

Motorman fourteen members of the security forces have been killed and fifty-six
wounded.
ARREST AND INTERROGATION POLICIES
2.

The meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against

the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given
rise to press enquiries.

Possible changes in the law or legal procedure are

being considered by an inter-departmental group.

In considering in due course

whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving theirobjectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since
Operation Motorman and what has happened to them.

It will then be possible to

form a view as to the reasons why the hard-core of the Provisionals appears not
yet to have been brought into custody.

The Ministry of Defence will try to

prepare this analysis and make it available to the GOC, with whom there will
probably be discussions in Northern Ireland next week.

INFORMATION POLICY
3.

Questions about the Government's plans for dealing with the level of

military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the
news, and are difficult to handle.

There would be great dangers, however, in

trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced
to reduce their campaign against civilians.
LEGAL MATTERS

4.

It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought

of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers
Act.

When there is evidence, arrests can therefore be made with a view to

charges being brought.

The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office

will ensure that this is understood by the Army and the RUC respectively.

NORTHER IRELAND:

POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PEIOD

4 AUGUST - 10 AUGUST, 1972.

Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office

GENERAL
1. The main political development this week has been the decision of the
SDLP to talk to Mr Whitelaw. Discussions at the beginning of the week are
due to be followed by further talks today.
2. On the security front there have been fewer shootings and explosions
but a number of demonstrations. Searches by the security forces have
yielded substantial finds of arms and explosives, while Martin Meehan,
the Provisional IRA leader has been captured in the Ardoyne.
THE SDLP
3. Although, following recent military operations, the SDLP had made
statements indicating that they were reconsidering their decision to have
talks with Mr Whitelaw, they met him on Monday evening, and the talks
continued on Tuesday. A Government statement afterwards said "".... Among
the subjects discussed were internment, security policy and the military
use of certain facilities in the minority areas. The delegation expressed
strong views that internment should now end following the success of the
military domination of the former ""no go"" areas.
4. The Secretary of State said that he had today shown an earnest of his
good intent by releasing 47 internees and he pointed out that he had been
following Her Majesty's Government's policy by phasing out internment
since direct rule by releasing nearly 700 internees.
The Secretary of State took note of the SDLP's views and undertook to
convey them to Mr Heath as soon as possible. A further meeting with the
SDLP is to take place in Belfast on Friday.

5.

6. The SDLP said they did not feel that the release of 47 internees was
adequate and have insisted on a complete end to internment. They welcomed
the assurances they had been given on the impartiality of arms searches and
the Secretary of State's determination to end private armies, and
reiterated the strength of their constituents' feelings in relation to

The Secretary of State said that, since their last meeting, he had
spoken to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Defence

and put to them the arguments that the Social Democratic and Labour
Party (SDLP) had put to him on the ending of internment. He
reiterated the arguments, ie, that both he and the SDLP have the same
objectives; that the SDLP want him to succeed; that they have
supported him in the past; and that the political bonus of ending
internment would be an end of the civil disobedience campaign.
The Secretary of State said that the Prime Minister and
Lord Carrington had explained to him that they fully understood the
SDLP position and that the views of the SDLP would be considered;
however, as yet, no decision had been taken on the ending of internment.

The Secretary of State said that he knew that this outcome

would disapoint the SDLP but he hoped that they would be patient

since more time was needed. The Secretary of State added that it
is still HMG's policy to phase out internment as soon as the security
situation permits; the only point of issue between HMG and the SDLP

4629,IMG_7899_PREM_15_1012,"is on timing.

As an earnest of his good intentions, the Secretary
of State said that he had that day signed orders releasing 18 more
internees including the last of the official IRA. This, with his
previous releases, made a total of 65 persons released in a week.
The Secretary of State explained the position regarding detainees
and pointed out that it was only the Attorney-General who could
order their release.
Mr Fitt asked the Secretary of State whether he felt he would be in
a position next week to release more internees. The Secretary of
State said that he must reserve his position on this since further
releases would depend on events and he could not commit himself or
his Cabinet colleagues in advance. Mr Fitt returned to the problem
of detainees and the Secretary of State said that he would be talking
to the Attorney-General about them.
Mr. Hume was worried that, with the Secretary of State on holiday,
nothing would happen for the next two weeks. The Secretary of State
assured him that arrangements had been made to get papers to him
and there would be no delays on this account. Mr Hume felt strongly
that an opportunity had been lost in not ending internment
immediately. The Catholic population were awaiting the outcome of
the Secretary of State's talks with the SDLP and this had caused the

violence would increase.

They had taken a risk in talking to the Secretary of State and were
already being criticised by their own people for talking before the
end of internment.

Mr Hume's views that if the SDLP got nothing out

of the present talks they were finished were endorsed by his
colleagues.

The Secretary of State said he fully appreciated their position but
he again had to make it clear that only himself and his Cabinet

colleagues could be the judges on timing.

4630,IMG_7900_PREM_15_1012,"Mr Cooper said that, at their last meeting when 47 internees were
released, the Secretary of State had said that he was worried about
Loyalist reaction.
In fact, there had been little or no reaction
from either the Unionist press or politicians. Mr Hume added that,in
his opinion, the Secretary of State was lagging behind public opinion
on this issue. The Secretary of State agreed that; on the last
occasion, there was not the reaction he had expected and again restated his present position.
The Secretary of State said that he had that day issued invitations
to the political parties in Northern Ireland to attend his proposed
round-table conference at the end of September. Mr Hume stated the
SDLP's known policy that they would not attend any conference before
the ending of internment.
At this point (3.05 pm) Mr Devlin and Mr

O'Hanlon arrived and, for

their benefit, the Secretary of State gave a resume of what had
taken place prior to their arrival. Mr Devlin argued that the present
piecemeal policy of releasing would mean that internment would end
in a way which would benefit no one bar the Provisional IRA - again
violence would appear to pay.

He felt it should be possible for the

Secretary of State to name a date by which time internment would end.
The Secretary of State said that he noted this point but felt that it
would not be possible;

if a date were issued the Provisional IRA

would increase their violence to try and ensure that the deadline was
not kept to.

Messrs Currie, Hume and O'Hanlon again went over the

same ground and the Secretary of State again gave HMG's position.
By agreement, the Secretary of State then turned to the specific
points that the SDLP had raised with him at their last meeting on
7 August. With regard to the alleged biased background briefing
received by new Units on arrival in Northern Ireland, the Secretary
of State said that the book on which the complaint was based had
long since been withdrawn from circulation. (Point b. page 6 of last
meeting minutes.)
The Secretary of State explained that the Army had given orders for

photography of the ""census"" type to cease. Mr Devlin raised the case
of a certain Mr Kerr who had been photographed the day before and

towards licensed firearms; the Army's occupation of certain schools
in Belfast and their request that Republican Clubs and Sinn Fein should
be legalised.

The Secretary of State answered all these points but,

there were no general conclusions and no commitments were made.
The meeting returned to the subject of internment.

The SDLP said they
were now faced with the hoice of either attacking HMG's internment
policy or finding a means of maintaining the feeling of hope engendered
amongst Catholics by the SDLP talks with the Secretary of State.
Mr Hume and Mr Devlin again explained that, to keep their credibility
as a Party, the SDLP must come out of the meeting with something.

From

their point of view, talks with HMG must be kept going and they
wondered whether they could talk to the British Cabinet direct. The
Secretary of State said that he could not agree to this. He expressed
the view that, with the continued phasing out of internment, the SDLP
could claim to have got something out of their talks with him. He
thought that the SDLP could maintain their credibility if, after this
meeting, they put out a statement on the lines that they had again put
that they had been told that HMG

would keep the position under review;

that they were disappointed that

and that the Secretary of State
more internees had not been let out;
had made it clear that it remained HMG policy to phase out internment
depending on the security situation.

The talks adjourned at 4 pm so

that the SDLP could consider the Secretary of State's proposition.
At 4.20 pm the meeting resumed and Mr Devlin explained that he and his
colleagues were desperate for more time and that they needed the help of
the Secretary of State to retain their credibility until such times as
he released more internees.

The best way that Mr Devlin and his

colleagues could think of securing more time was if they could secure
an immediate meeting with the Prime Minister. The Secretary of State
said that there was certainly no possibility of an immediate meeting
but, to assist the SDLP in keeping credibility, he had no objections to
considering the possibility of arranging such a meeting. An agreed

Mr Fitt said that the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP)
had taken a major decision in agreeing to see the Secretary of

had been not to talk until internment was ended. Internment had

been widely condemned by politicians from all sides as immoral and

Mr Maudling when Home Secretary had repeatedly referred to the need

security situation was satisfactory the en would no longer be held
as hostages. Operation Motorman had put the Protestant community

into a state of euphoria and provided the Secretary of State with
an opportunity to make a reciprocal gesture by ending internment.
The SDLP considered that most Protestants would now agree that
there was no longer any reason for internment. Operation Motorman

4678,IMG_7948_PREM_15_1012,"and the ending of internment should have been parallel actions,
and if the opportunity o end it now was missed it might be too
late. If violence began again on an increased scale the majority
would demand the continuation of internment. The SDLP had made
such political sacrifices so far that if the Secretary of State
was unable to respond to their approach by endinginternment
immediately they would be completely discredited in the eyes of
the Roman Catholic community. The first anniversary of internment
was approaching.

If the Secretary of State listened to the SDLP

case he would have every justification for ending internment at
once.
The Secretary of State said that he appreciated the dificulties
the SDLP had faced. He too had had his difficulties. They should
not forget the intense antagonisms he had aroused in the majority
community over the previous four months by adopting policies, many
of which were consistent with the views of the SDLP. He had tried
to be impartial, but had been repeatedly attacked for his efforts.
Some of the measures he had taken had been helped by the efforts of
the SDLP and he was aware that some of their actions had facilitated

the removal of the barricades. 'Bloody Friday' had made Operation
Motorman inevitable. He had been conscious that Londonderry was the
key to the situation and that the only possible course was the
complete removal of all barricades. Every effort had been made to
make the operation impartial, but it was inevitable that most work
had been needed to remove the biggest barricades, and these were in
the Roman Catholic areas.

The object had been to get the

Provisional IRA off the backs of the community at large, including
the SDLP. Action was therefore especially necessary in the SDLP
constituencies. He was however equally determined to take action
in the Protestant areas, and there had been substantial arms finds
there.

He was conscious however that arms finds in Protestant

areas seldom attracted the same amount of publicity. He was
determined to put an end to private armies on all sides and would
do so. He appreciated the arguments advanced for the ending of
internment. His problem was primarily one of tiing. The SDLP
wanted it to end immediately, but they should consider also what
his position would be if he appeared ""to dance to their tune"", It
would be wrng for him to give them any guarantees about the ending
of internment. He could not give guarantees to anybody. He had

already given evidence of his intention to end internment.

dancing to the SDLP's tune. They wanted a political response to a

unchallengeable.

the Secretary of State would demonstrate that political initiatives

two stools.
The rest or the internees were being held as hostages
to blackmail by the Unionists. Their continued internment would
provide encouragement and support for the Provisional IRA. The
Unionists had always got their way by threatening a backlash and

they were continuing to do so. The Secretary or State should bear
in mind that one internee created a whole family of supporters for

the Provisional IRA. The security advice
Special branch of the RUC - on which 300 people remained interned
was the same advice which had interned a thousand men in the first

reject in respect of some 70 men. The SDLP had received nothing
but the continued internment of some 300 of their constituents.
They would now copletely lose credibility in their communities.

The Secretary of State said that the release o 47 internees was
his immediate response. The SDLP could not expect more at this
stage since this was the first occasion on which he had had an
opportunity to hear their views and arguments expressed in full.

The dividing line between Official and Provisional IRA members was
not in fact as tidy as the SDLP implied.

The Unionists' demands

I told your office that I would let you have a
summary report of the points raised when the Secretary
of State saw the Prime Minister this morning.

The Secretary of State said that the S.D.L.P. had
swung round again and were once again demanding the end
of internment as a condition of talking to him. He
explained why he could not end internment, though he
might be able to release some more internees. He said
that he would ask Dr. Hillery, when he met him later in
the day, to put pressure on the S.D.L.P. to talk first
and if necessary rumble afterwards rather than try
to impose pre-conditions for talks.
The Secretary of State talked about the need to
control the border more closely than at present.
The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State agreed
that it was clear from Mr.Lynch's message ard the Prime
Minister's talk with the Irish Ambassador, that the
Government of the Republic wanted to be involved in the

talks about the future of Northern Ireland.

The Prime

Minister hoped that the Secretary of State would make
no concessions at all to Dr. Hillery: anything that

was done should be done between himself and Mr.Lynch.
There was some discussion about interrogation and
intelligence.
The Secretary of State outlined his thoughts about
the constitutional solution at which he thought we should
be aiming. The main elements were:(i)
A regional council or assembly, elected by
proportional representation, controlling health,
education, agriculture, commerce and (at least to
some extent) finance.
(ii) Responsibility for the police and the prison
service (and possibly for some other ""law and order""
functions) to remain with Viestminster.

The Attorney General has now considered Sir William
Nield's paper on preventive detention for terrorist
conduct, to which you referred in your Minute of the
31st July.
The Attorney has noted that the paper rejects any
suggestion of the creation of a new criminal offence capable
of trial within the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal
courts. It envisages rather that persons against whom
there is insufficient evidence to secure a conviction
under the criminal law (including the Special Powers Act
provisions) should nevertheless be detained if their
conduct has involved them in ""complicity in any degree
with terrorism generally"". The ordinary rules of
evidence will not be applied and the normal rights of
an accused person in the criminal courts will not be
available to him. A decision on whether a person is
""guilty"" would be made by persons acting on hearsay in
the exercise of their discretion. In effect, this would
be a substitution of the administrative decision of (now)
the Secretary of State by the decision of a committee.
In these circumstances the Attorney regards it as
wholly inappropriate to describe the body which is to
impose preventive detention as ""a court"", or to speak
The Detention
of a case being proved against the accused.
Order would depend on the arbitrary decision of this
committee which would presumably not be required to state
the grounds of their decision. Thus any system of appeal
to the High Court would be very difficult if not impossible.
Such committees (which could be described as tribunals)
would accordingly be acting under no presently acceptable
process of law; they would not be within the tradition of
the courts and could hardly be manned by judges whose
constitutional duties would make them wholly inappropriate

to operate the proposed system.

Clearly the Lord Chancellor

would have to be consulted if there was any question of

judges manning such tribunals.

In the opinion of the Attorney General it would be
possible to provide by legislation for the establishment
of a procedure whereby persons would be subject to
preventive detention on the exercise of the discretion of
a tribunal which was satisfied that the persons brought
before it had been concerned with terrorism. There could

HM Government it clear, on assuming direct responsibility
for the government of Northern Ireland, t hat it was their
objective to bring internment under the Special Powers Act to
as soon as the security situation permitted; and to
consider how far the powers conferred under that Act could be

dispensed with.
HM Government reaffirm these objectives and their determination
to use
the processes of law to the fullest possible extent in

dealing with terrorism.

In pursuit of those objectives, since

30
March 1972, 724 persons have been released from internment
or detention; 171 persons are still interned
and 70 persons
are held in detention. During the same period, the

enforcement authorities,

acting vigorously under the ordinary

processes of the criminal law, have achieved considerable
success and well over 300 persons have been charged with offences
connected with terrorist activities.
Nevertheless, certain basic problems of countering terrorism
by the normal processes of law still present difficulties.
These include the problem of preventing the intimidation of
Witnesses who may be in danger of their lives if they give
evidence

in court; and of bringing to trial many of those

who, although responsible for organising and directing
terrorism, take care to avoid so far as possible themselves

engaging in terrorist operations. The system of internment
cannot be ended without putting something in its place.
This does not mean, however,

that there cannot be changes.

4782,IMG_8053_PREM_15_1013,"The Government therefore propose to set up at an early date a
commission of experienced lawyers and laymen to advise them on the
measures required to deal with terrorist organisations and to bring
to book individuals involved in terrorist activities without the
necessity to resort to powers of internment;

the commission's report, to prepare substantive legislation to that
end.

The Government reaffirm their determination to improve the security
situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including
those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot be dealt with

through the normal processes of the criminal law.

Pending the report

of the commission and the subsequent legislation on it, the Government propose to make changes to strengthen the existing law to
facilitate the prosecution of persons for membership of unlawful
associations. In addition, they intend at an early date to introduce
provisions under the Special Powers Act to set up a tribunal to deal
with persons suspected of participation in terrorist activities by
means of a procedure which will provide maximum safeguards for the
protection of the individual and will eliminate the objectionable
features of internment, notably judgment by executive decision alone,
but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately
obtain in Northern Ireland.

This tribunal will be asked to consider

cases referred to it (which will include cases of those presently in
internment or detention) to determine the nature of their involvement
in terrorist activities with a view to their release or committal to
a period of detention.

This procedure is very different from intern-

ment.
The details of these proposals will be explained when the necessary
measures are laid before Parliament. But the Government wish to make
clear at once that these measures will not in any way be directed
against the holding of opinions, but against the use, or encouragement,
of violence and terror to force those opinions on law abiding citizens.
These interim provisions will be employed only where the ordinary
processes of the criminal law are inadequate and will be enforced with
complete impartiality against whatever persons or organisations are
found to be engaged in terrorism and violence.

the subsequent legislation on it, the Government therefore proposes
at an early date to introduce interim legislation under the
Special Powers Act to set up a special tribunal to deal with
persons accused of terrorist activities by means of a procedure
which will preserve the essentials of natural justice, but which
will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately

obtain in Northern Ireland.

This tribunal will be asked to

consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which
will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine

the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either
to order release or to impose a definite period of detention.
The details of these proposals will be explained when the
necessary measures are laid before Parliament.

But the Government

wishes to make clear at once that these measures will not in any
way be directed against the holding of opinions, but only against
the use of violence and terror to force those opinions on law

The Secretary of State considers that our needs would best be met

by Course II.

If this is not acceptable on legal grounds, he would

reluctantly accept Course I, although he would regard this as much less
satisfactory on political grounds

since it could be regarded as coming

""pretty near to the objectionable procedure of internment"".
5.

The Secretary of State hopes to make a public statement tomorrow,

which will explain his intentions and will strengthen the political and
security position so enabling him to make progress towards the achievement
of the Government's political aims.
6.

In so far as the draft annexed to GEN 79(72) 21 makes it clear that

the Government are not prepared to end internment pending the creation
of new legal procedures,

the statement must presumably be regarded as

the answer to the SDLP which you promised them at the end of your meeting
with them last week.

It may well be the decisive factor, therefore,

inhibiting them from attending the forthcoming conference.

in

If so, it is

difficult to see much immediate political advantage in either course.

And

both courses suffer from the further disadvantage that they would involve
legislation;

that it would therefore be some time before they took effect;

but that, once the preferred course had been given a statutory basis, there
would be a natural presumption that it would persist beyond the phase of
direct rule into the period of the long-term constitutional settlement - with

the anomalous result that, although the Province would presumably have
become more rather than less closely linked with Great Britain, we should
have chosen that moment to establish in one part of the United Kingdom an
abnormal judicial procedure which would not be acceptable in any other
part.
7.

Nevertheless, the Secretary of State is entitled to claim

(paragraph 4 of his memorandum) that he cannot go on much longer on the
present basis;

and the Committee may agree that the long-term political

objections to Course II must yield to the immediate requirements of
security.

The Attorney General rightly refers, in paragraphs 11-13 of his

memorandum, to his difficulties in continuing to delay the release of
detainees and asks that the Secretary of State should either intern them or
transfer to himself, by Order, the responsibility for their release.

Ministers will have no difficulty in agreeing that we should
continue,

so far as possible, to use the normal courts to

deal with terrorists.
(b)

This proposal involves amending Regulation 24.A. to make

clear:(i)

that the proscription of the Irish Republican Army
includes the Provisional Wing as well as the Officials;

(ii)

that the offence of becoming or remaining a member

of a proscribed organisation is extended to include
professing to be a member of it or speaking on its
behalf, and perhaps financing and fund-raising also.
Moreover, any person who is present at a number
of meetings of an unlawful association, or speaks on
its behalf, will have to prove that he is not a member
of it.

Proposal (i) could be circumvented by changes of name (cf. a
recent Intelligence report that the Officials were thinking of
calling themselves the ""Irish Revolutionary Army"").

But

there are reasons for not attempting to define a subversive
organisation on the lines of Section 3 of the Canadian Act,
since either it then becomes necessary to prove in every single
case that the organisation in question satisfies the definition
or we are in the dilemma of stating conditions which have to be
satisfied while declaring arbitrarily that certain organisations
satisfy them.
Proposal (ii) admittedly reverses the normal onus of proof - i. e. it
is incumbent on the defendant to establish his innocence instead of
on the prosecution to establish his guilt.

But this seems inherent

in the nature of the case.
(c)

In favour of the proposal to introduce special courts or tribunals

(which is also discussed in Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17) it can be
argued that we should in principle be substituting a judicial
process for the executive machinery which at present governs
internment and detention.

But it will undoubtedly be politically

controversial to introduce judicial processes different from those
of the normal courts (although the Secretary of State deploys
the counter arguments in paragraph 5 of the Annex to
GEN 79(72) 19);

withdraw from the projected conference as a result.

may be thought worth paying.

To begin to dismantle the Special Powers Act will be politically
popular.

Paragraph 8 of the Annex to GEN 79(72) 19, however,

envisages retaining for the time being those parts of the Act
which confer powers on the security forces.

These are

presumably those relating to stopping and searching,

but do

they also include the powers of arrest without warrant?

Given an intention to dispense with internment, there seems no
alternative to the detention under Regulation 11 of persons
arrested as terrorists until special courts or tribunals are
introduced.

As pointed out in paragraph 3 of Appendix 3 to

GEN 79(72) 17, however, this will certainly be criticised as a
disguised form of internment without the provision of the present

I should be glad of your agreement that we can give Peck
discretion to deliever a copy before his departure, which would

other hand, the British Government could not force the Northern
Irish to join the Irish Republic.

Meanwhile, he did not

It was internment which

had for the time being qualified his admiration for worldrenowned British justice.

The Prime

irister said that he did

not disagree with the Pope's views on internment;
it could be got rid of the better.

the sooner

Already, since the

introduction of direct rule from Westminster, the numbers of
those interned had been reduced from over 1000 to 171 and he
hoped that more would be released.

Those released

so far, with

a few exceptions, had not been found to have reverted to
terrorist activities.

The Pope said that this gradual phasing

out of internment seemed very wise.

The Prime Minister went

on to say that it was hoped soon to deal with such cases under
charges of delinquency etc.,

rather than by the present system

of imprisonment without trial.

The difficulty of course was to

persuade witnesses to give evidence against internees in the
ordinary courts of law.

He intended to introduce in

Parliament measures to provide ways and means whereby the
Court would be able to protect such witnesses, and in due
course this arrangement would even further reduce the number
of internees to a very small hard core.
The Prime Minister said he hoped that the Pope felt that
the British Governent was indeed trying to restore freedom.
This was certainly the case.

But as long as there were

gunmen we should regrettably need troops.

The Pope

wished the Prime Minister well in his efforts to resolve
this long outstanding and intractable problem.
He had
been most heartened and encouraged by what the Prime Minister

authorities, with whom he was in constant touch, or to
the Secretary of State with whom he had had a meeting only

a week after the beating up was alleged to have occurred.
The Prime Minister was sure that Mr. Lynch would understand,
in the light of what he had said, why it was sometimes
felt that the priests were playing the IRA's game.
Mr. Lynch did not deny that, in a highly charged
situation, people might make more of incidents than they

really justified.

But he thought that the priests had

resented the fact that their allegations had been the
subject of an immediate official denial by the Army
authorities but that, after a few days, the civilian
authorities had put out a statement that implied that
there was at least some validity in the allegations.
The Prime Minister said that the Army statement had been
concerned to deny the wide general allegations which
had been made, and was justified in so doing.

The Prime Minister said that the British Government
were running into similar legal problems to those of the
Irish Government.

They had set up the tribunal to deal

with the internees, so that they could in effect move over
to a system of detention like that available to the Irish
authorities.

GHURKAS IN NORTHERN IRELAND

The possible posting of a Ghurka battalion to Northern Ireland was considered.
In discussion the following points were made:Certain undertakings about the Ghurkas' service in the UK given to
i.
Parliament by Lord Carrington would have to be reviewed.
ii.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would establish what undertakings had
been given to the Nepalese Government at that time.

iii.

It seemed unlikely that there would be any major outcry from the Irish

Authorities.

iv.
There might be considerable adverse reaction from various groups in
Great Britain.

v.

If posted to Northern Ireland, Ghurkas would not be used for riot control,
and possibly not on the border either.
vi.
As part of the British Army, the Ghurkas should be expected to do their
share of duty in Northern Ireland.
It was noted that the Ministry of Defence were still themselves considering the
merits of the proposal.

Arrest Policy
MOD stressed their need for a directive on arrest policy for Protestant
extremists. It was agreed that any new policy would have to be settled at
the highest level.

5.

Army Reinforcements during the Plebiscite
It was noted that from MOD's point of view the preferred date for the
Plebiscite was in the last fortnight of January. This would be the most
convenient time to provide Army reinforcements.
A further important factor in determining the date of the Plebiscite was its
timing in relation to the subsequent publication of the White Paper.

The possibility had to be faced that the Commission might report that there

it was all the more important that the Tribunals should be seen to beoperating
fairly and effectively.

situation;

comments on the results of the local elections;

possible outcomes of the elections to the Assembly;

reflects on

and refers to the

timetable of Northern Ireland legislation at present before Parliament.
Terrorism

2.

The IRA are considerably weakened but still capable of spasmodic

violence.

The Secretary of State will report on the recent increase in

Protestant terrorist activity.

You may wish to ask him whether this is

likely to affect the chances of the one or two UDA men (e.g. Mr. Herron)
who are standing in the Assembly elections,

and whether Mr. Craig will be

successful in preventing some of the obloquy from brushing off on his Party.
The memorandum also refers to a campaign, already beginning, for the
release of prisoners from the Maze.

The Secretary of State is probably

right in saying that ""We cannot go on indefinitely increasing the number of
people held"".

But what alternative does he suggest?

And, more generally,

does he see any real end to sectarian terrorism in the foreseeable future?
If not, what are the chances that the new constitutional arrangements will
even get off the ground?
The Elections
3.

The Secretary of State is surely right in warning his colleagues that

the results of the local elections should not be taken as a reliable guide to
the outcome of the elections to the Assembly.

The recent JIC report on

""The Irish Situation"" (JIC(A)(73)(SA)(IR) 31 of 6th June) provides a very
useful commentary on this subject.

Perhaps its most significant sentence

is the statement that ""The vote as a whole, however, particularly among
Protestants, demonstrated once again the defensive and sectarian nature
of Northern Ireland politics"".
therefore,

The Secretary of State may well be right,

in predicting that, because many Protestant voters cast their

second votes in favour of more extreme candidates, the Catholics (many of
whom appear to have given their first vote to the Alliance Party, while many
of those who voted for the SDLP did not give their second votes to Catholic
extremists) may now follow the Protestant example and move outwards

""When HMG assumed direct responsibility for affairs
in Northern Ireland in March 1972, the Prime Minister
stated

the government's intention to make a start in the

process of bringing internment to an end.

The Secretary

of State for Northern Ireland reviewed personally the

5888,IMG_9320_PREM_15_1692,"2.

The procedures for internment which HMG had

inherited were far from satisfactory, and there was
the general question whether any special procedures
for detention were necessary at all.

The Government

therefore appointed a Commission, composed of
distinguished laymen and lawyers, and chaired by a
most eminent judge of the House of Lords, Lord Diplock.
The Commission was asked to find out whether terrorist
activity could be dealt with by the criminal courts.
In December 1972 they reported that, because
witnesses were intimidated or afraid to give evidence,
no criminal procedure which satisfied the requirements
of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights
could effectively bring terrorists to justice.

3.

While the Commission was deliberating, the

Government proposed, and Parliament in Westminster
approved, the abolition of internment by the
Executive as it had been practised

Northern

Ireland law, and the enactment, as an interim measure
pending the Commission's Report, procedures for
detention.

Specific safeguards were incorporated, which have

been in operation since 7 November 1972, as follows:

No-one is now detained except under these

procedures and those detained have been found by an
independent commissioner with legal training and
experience to have been involved in terrorism and to
be someone from whom the public need to be protected.

ordinary criminal procedures were effective in bringing
these people to justice, but the findings of the

that they are not

and cannot be so effective

HMG therefore propose, in legislation which is

now before Parliament, to confirm the new detention
procedures, but to provide for them to lapse after
12 months unless they are renewed for a further period

It will become clear(once the Bill

",6 april 1973  the prime ministers message to the pope was delivered on the afternoon of 20 march itself apart from the point raised again about internment mentioned further in paragraph 3 below the popes reply seems unexceptionable  i have discussed the white paper twice with archbishop 2 casarole since 20 march delay in sending a reply has been mainly due to caution on the part of the popes advisers who were perhaps understandably enough more interested in the reactions to the white paper of all parties concerned than in the substance of the paper itself they were anxious that the pope should not be advised to lend support even if privately and in confidence to an initiative which was going to be opposed by any main section of opinion other than the roman catholic and protestant extremists themselves before composing a first draft of the popes reply they apparently satisfied themselves for example that the government in dublin as well as moderates on both sides  in northern ireland were generally speaking in support of the proposals contained  in the white paper  3 as seen from here the one rather disappointing point raised once more inthe popes reply is his renewed plea for the practice of internment without trial to be ended this was somewhat unexpected as paragraphs 58to 60 of the white paper dealt with this point and we had sent the vatican the text of mr whitelaws statement made in the house of commons on 20 december last on the report of the diplock commission we had also sent the text of the prime ministers similar statement on 28 march which again deals with internment moreover the prime minister himself had explained to the pope our difficulties about internment  
5904,IMG_9336_PREM_15_1692,"DURING THEIR MEETING LAST OCTOBER, INFORMING HIM THAT, SINCE THE
INTRODUCTION OF DIRECT RULE, THE NUMBER OF INTERNEES HAD BEEN
REDUCED FROM OVER 1,000 TO SOME 171 AND THAT MORE WOULD SOON BE
RELEASED. AT THE OFFICIAL LEVEL I HAVE NOW COME OVER THE WHOLE
GROUND AGAIN, AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE DO NOT NOW AT THIS STAGE
GET INTO A FURTHER HIGH LEVEL ARGUMENT ABOUTINTERNEES.
I UNDERSTAND THAT POPE PAUL HIMSELF MUCH APPRECIATED
RECEIVING THE PRIME MINISTER'S PERSONAL MESSAGE AND THAT HE IS

4.

NOW ALSO PREPARED, IN THE CONTEXT OF PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE, TO GIVE
US SOME DEGREE OF INEI RECT SUPPORT IN PUBLIC. HE WAS HIMSELF
CONSIDERING AT ONE TIME THAT HE MIGHT DECLARE HIS SUPPORT FOR THE
WHITE PAPER MORE OR LESS IN SPECIFIC TERMS. HIS ADVISERS HOWEVER
ARE OF THE VIEW (POSSIBLY RIGHTLY) THAT OPEN SUPPORT MIGHT ONLY
RESULT IN ULSTER PROTESTANTS SUSPECTING THAT THE PAPER'S PROPOSALS
WERE AFTER ALL SOMETHING OF A POPISH PLOT WEIGHTED AGAINST THEIR
OWN INTERESTS, AND THAT THEREFORE ANY SUCH DECLARATION OF PAPAL SUPPORT
MIGHT BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. THE POPE I S THEREFORE MORE LIKELY,
THOUGH THIS IS STILL NOT FINALLY DECIDED, TO SPEAK MORE GENERALLY
BUT ALSO MORE BRIEFLY, AND NO DOUBT IN LESS FORTHRIGHT TERMS, ALONG

THE SORT OF LNES ADOPTED BY CARDINAL HEENAN IN HIS SERMON ON
18 MARCH AS REPORTED BY BBC TV NEWS-READER PETER WOODS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE POPE SO DECIDES HE WILL PROBABLY CHOOSE
AN OCCASION DURING L EASTER TO MAKE SOME SUCH PUBLIC REFERENCE.

",during their meeting last october informing him that since the introduction of direct rule the number of internees had been reduced from over 1000 to some 171 and that more would soon be released at the official level i have now come over the whole ground again and i would suggest that we do not now at this stage get into a further high level argument aboutinternees i understand that pope paul himself much appreciated receiving the prime ministers personal message and that he is  4  now also prepared in the context of paragraph 2 above to give us some degree of inei rect support in public he was himself considering at one time that he might declare his support for the white paper more or less in specific terms his advisers however are of the view possibly rightly that open support might only result in ulster protestants suspecting that the papers proposals were after all something of a popish plot weighted against their own interests and that therefore any such declaration of papal support might be counterproductive the pope i s therefore more likely though this is still not finally decided to speak more generally but also more briefly and no doubt in less forthright terms along  the sort of lnes adopted by cardinal heenan in his sermon on 18 march as reported by bbc tv newsreader peter woods i understand that if the pope so decides he will probably choose an occasion during l easter to make some such public reference  crawley  rid

Exchange

of Messages with the Pope
The Prime Minister has seen the Pope's reply set out
He has noted in particular
in Holy See telegram No. 18.
the request in paragraph 4 that internment should be ended,
and would be grateful for your advice on whether he should
send a further message to the Pope explaining what action
Such a message might
has been taken over internment.
explain the new procedures for detention and the legislative
action now being taken in the light of theDiplock Report.
If your advice is that the Prime Minister should send a
further message to the Pope on these lines I should be
grateful for a draft by Thursday 12 April so that it can
be handed to the Pope in good time beforeEaster.
The Prime Minister has not yet seen Holy See telegram
No. 19 containing Mr. Crawley's comments on the Pope's reply.
I will show this telegram to the Prime Mi n i ster: but I am
not convinced that he will accept Mr. Crawley's argument
against a further approach.
He may feel that a personal
approach from himself may produce a more positive result
than discussions with Vatican officials.

IRA Activity.
Reports continue to indicate that Provisional morale is low
and that they have found it increasingly difficult to operate due to SF domination.
They have been further hampered by selective arrests and subsequent detention of
senior officers the most important of which was Cornelius McHugh, the Operations
Officer of the 1st Battalion in Belfast.
Though IRA activities have to some
extent been reduced during the week reports of a forthcoming intesification of the
sniping campaign have been received.
Incidents during the week included the attempted
murder of a Resident Magistrate, a successful booby-trap attack in a house in Armagh,
and the shooting of an RUC constable on foot patrol in Belfast.

Incident in Andersontown. On 2 October the Provisional IRA ambushed and
killed a member ofa plain clothes surveillance team posing as the driver of a
sundry delivery van. This patrol was part of a most successful intelligence
gathering operation which had, over the past few months, provided information which
had been responsible for, either directly or indirectly, over 30% of the arrests of
Provisional IRA officers in the Andersonstown area. A WRAC member of the patrol
escaped unhurt. The IRA simultaneously raided a home which they believed to be the
Headquarters of this unit. The Four Square Laundry Service, as it was called, has
now been withdrawn. It was, incidentally, a popular laundry service offering good
service at cut rates.

11. Bombs. During the week there were 15 explosions in the City amongst which were
two particularly significant car bombs. The first, a 100 lb device, exploded outside
the James Connelly Club killing ex detainee Patrick McKee, a Volunteer in the
Provisional IRA. Whether planted by extreme Protestants or intended to exacerbate
interfactional differences may never be known. The second car bomb loaded with

200 lbs of explosive in a settee which was then delivered to a furniture warehouse by
bombers posing as workmen.

LONDONDERRY
12. The city has remained quiet during the week with only 23 shooting incidents in
which one soldier was very seriously injured and in another an RUC constable was
slightly wounded. Although 9 bombs were found and defused there were only 4
explosions in the city, one of which was a device in the region of 600 lbs.
Hooliganism in the form of stoning and bottling of patrols was considerably reduced
compared to the previous week and at a 'Prayer for Peace' meeting 1500 people were

exhorted to keep the children off the streets.
RURAL AND BORDER AREAS
13. Rural. Security Forces have been fired on in rural towns notably Portadown,
Armagh, Coalisland and Maghera but there has been no inordinate increase in terrorist
activity. On 27 September a 100 lb bomb destroyed Armagh City Hall and others
damaged premises in Armagh, Newry, Dungiven and Portadown. There have also been a
number of minor stoning incidents in Armagh and several anti-Catholic hooligan attacks
in Bangor.
14. Cross Border Activity. In addition to continued attacks on electricity pylons,
the most significant event was the IRA raid into Castlederg on 29 September. This
raid, following so soon after the incident reported last week, in which a UDR soldier
and his wife were murdered in their home on the Border, illustrates how easy it is

for the terrorist to mount his activities from the Republic.
OUTLOOK
15. Provisionals may be expected to continue sniping attacks against the Security
Forces in Belfast and the rural areas, and to continue to attempt to mine Security
Force vehicles in the country. Although the rate may be raised in response to further
Security Force successes, it is unlikely that the Provisionals have the capability in
Belfast (given the reportedly weak state of the 1st/3rd Battalions) to sustain a much
increased level of activity. In Londonderry, however, following the reported return

of leading Provisionals from the Republic, an increase in activity may be expected.

Security Forces Activity. Amidst reducing force levels
and additional commitments on the Protestant front, pressure
continues to be applied to the 'hard IRA' areas. This
profile survive
hilst IRA activity remains lower than for
any period since the ceasefire; but the additional presence
required with the emergence of UVF terrorism will seriously
stress deployment in IRA dominated enclaves. Intelligence
improves and hence arrest of key terrorists and recovery of
arms parallels this progress. Since Operation MOTORMAN,
over 700 persons have been arrested of which approximately
300 have been charged. Frustrations continue to occur when
apparently serious offenders are released on bail rather
than being held on remand. The arrest figures on
Provisional Officers to date are shown below.
6.
Political. The Europa Lodge Hotel in DARLINGTON, Co
DURHAM has been selected as the venue for next week's
constitutional conference on Northern Ireland. It now seems
certain that when the Conference gets under way on Monday
25 September only the Unionist, Labour and Alliance parties
will be represented. The SDLP and the DUP, though refusing
to attend the Conference, are expected to publish their
proposals for the future Government of Northern Ireland
before the talks begin. The Derry Nationalist Party announced
its intention to contest the forthcoming local government
elections. It is closely aligned to the Provisional IRA.
In another attempt to enter the political arena, the
Provisional IRA in LONDONDERRY have formed the Derry Defence
Association. Despite the merger of Vanguard, UDA and LAW
clear differences of opinion exist between the leaders.
BELFAST

7.

Sniping and bomb attacks remain at a similar level to the
previous period, more accurate shooting has accounted for the
still high casualty figures. The most concentrated attacks
occurred on 14 September after the arrest of
(OC B Company 2nd Battalion Provisional IRA). The number of
unexplained attacks on civilians has increased and most of

these victims have beep Catholics. Following one such
incident on 17 September,
, the OC of C Company
UDA was arrested by Security Forces and has since been
charged with attempted murder. The most serious of the
explosions in the city is believed to have been a Protestant
bomb planted outside a Catholic owned hotel frequented by IRA. The
high casualty figures (3 killed and 50 injured) was largely
due to the absence of warning, unusual in IRA inspired bombs.
UDA masked patrols have been more active during the week,
many of them armed with cudgels. The UDA rally on
16 September passed off peacefully as did the much smaller
Vanguard rally on the same day.

8.
Shooting in the rural areas has remained sporadic with
incidents occurring in ARMAGH, DUNGANNON and PORTADOWN,
although most of the activity was confined to the border areas.

A number of pylons were felled in Co TYRONE.

The main DUBLIN/

BELFAST railway line was slightly damaged by an explosion 600

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR
THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 1972
INTRODUCTION
1. General. A number of events have held the headlines on the Irish scene during
this period. The Protestant rioting of the first three nights of last week
culminated inevitably in shooting between the Security Forces and UVF - inspired
extremists in which two Protestants were killed and two wounded. Despite the
deaths of 3 soldiers over the weekend caused by a Provisional mine, petulant
Protestants are prepared to strike and demonstrate for the removal of the regiment
they consider responsible for the deaths of their so-called innocent citizens. Much
of the current terrorist activity is designed to promote the power of the faction
concerned prior to the Secretary of State's talks and, just as the UVF - inspired
action was set up to show the strength of the Protestant front, further IRA
atrocities can be expected to attempt to prove their domination of events. An
extension of this 'jockeying' is the emergence, after weeks of disarray, of a new
hard line Protestant political party which unites the Vanguard, the para-military
Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Association of Workers. It was
significant that the tragedy of Munich aroused universal anger and condemnation even
though Northern Ireland had endured death and destruction on a far greater scale
without the spontaneous outflow of sympathy and the creation of the will to act
internationally against terrorism.
2. IRA Activity. Despite reports that the Provisional IRA campaign in Ulster
would be intensified in order to disrupt the Secretary of State's conference, it has
remained subdued. The level of bomb attacks and snipings have remained at much the
same level as last week. With the exception of the mining of a Saracen near
Dungannon the Border has been virtually free of serious incidents. Although 8 soldiers
were injured in 132 urban sniping incidents, there are indications that in Belfast
the IRA's reduced activity may be due to low morale in their battalions caused by
the continued pressure of the current phase of Operation Motorman.
Protestant Activity. Militant Protestant activity has dominated the situation
during the week. On 7 September two civilians were shot dead and two wounded in the
Shankill after Security Forces came under fire. In a statement on 8th September the
UDA denied 'official involvement' in the shooting although it was implicitly admitted
that individual members acting without authority might have been involved. Nevertheless
the UDA have used the incident to boost their flagging support and their already active
propaganda campaign against the Security Forces. Furthermore, in a protest at the
continued presence of the Parachute Regiment in the Shankill, the Belfast East and West

3.

Power Stations, largely staffed by member of LAW, are on strike. The activities of
a number of cases of
the UDA continue to pose a threat in the Portadown area;
intimidation of Catholic families combined with a less friendly demeanour toward the
Security Forces are all indications of the changed mood.
Security Forces Activity. The domination of hard Catholic areas continues.
Detention orders have been signed on a number of Provisionals. Large hauls of firearms
and ammunition have been recovered in search operations which have become increasingly
successful as more information is received from those members of the public who are
becoming increasingly disaffected with the IRA.Battalions are beginning to know who
and what is in their areas and the coming weeks should see more arrests and hence
further inroads will be made into the IRA organisation. Patrolling continues in
Border and Rural areas and, despite the tragic mining incident on Sunday, their success
maybe measured in the significant reduction in explosives used, in the increased
routine finds and the arrest figures produced by intensive alert patrolling.

OPERATIONS
There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes
and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces.

wounded.

Possible changes in the law or legal procedure are

being considered by an inter-departmental group.

In considering in due course

whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving their.
objectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since
Operation Motorman and what has happened to them.

It will then be possible to

form a view as to the reasons why the hard-core of the Provisionals appears not
yet to have been brought into custody.

The Ministry of Defence will try to

prepare this analysis and make it available to the GOC, with whom there will
probably be discussions in Northern Ireland next week.
INFORMATION POLICY
Questions about the Government's plans for dealing with the level of

military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the
news, and are difficult to handle.

There would be great dangers, however, in

trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced
to reduce their campaign against civilians.
LEGAL MATTERS
4.

It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought

of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers
Act.

When there is evidence, arrests can therefore be made with a view to

charges being brought.

The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office

will ensure that this is understood by the Army and the RUC respectively.

of State for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Defence and the

I am also sending a copy to the Attorney General.

The essential features of this report are as follows:(a)

Legislation would be required (on the lines indicated in Appendix C)
in order both to confer on the Government the necessary additional
powers and,

(b)

subsequently, to indemnify all concerned.

In order to be fully effective the policy would require an additional
27 major units plus supporting elements.

(c)

The reinstatement of internment and interrogation would be
inevitable (on the basis of a potential ""bag"" of about 1600 additional
internees in the first two weeks);

and it would also be necessary

to arrest on suspicion alone.
(d)

A great deal would depend on the extent to which we could continue
to count on local co-operation as regards the maintenance of
essential services and on the loyalty of the RUC.

Otherwise,

the result might be complete anarchy.

The impact on the Republic and on international opinion generally
is unpredictable but would be bound to be adverse;

For all these reasons we could not sustain this policy indefinitely
or, perhaps, for very long.

It would therefore be essential that

we should launch some new political initiative - possibly on an
all-Ireland basis - very soon after we had taken the drastic measures
envisaged.

Otherwise, or if the political initiative failed, the last

state might be worse than the first.

I have discussed the report with the Permanent Secretaries concerned

and the CGS.

We were directed to examine a specific course of action that

Ministers might wish to consider if the security situation in Northern
Ireland had deteriorated so far that the Government were on the point of

losing control of events.
2.

We have taken as a basic assumption that the Government's aim remains

the restoration of a stable society in Northern Ireland, which will
remain part of the United Kingdom unless and until the majority of its

inhabitants wish otherwise.

We have not examined the option of a direct

military assault upon the extremist-dominated Roman Catholic areas of the
Province with the aim of securing a total military victory over the

Irish Republican Army (IRA), on the ground that it would so completely
alienate the.Roman Catholic community from the British Government as to
destroy for many years any remaining prospect of re-establishing a stable

society within the United Kingdom.

Nor do we believe that Ministers

would be willing to consider a complete withdrawal of military forces.
3.

The course we have been asked to consider is one of strong but

impartial action,

aimed at the removal of arms and explosives by means of

a massive reinforcement of troops, and accompanied by searches,
interrogation,

and probably internment.

It would be directed as necessary

against extremists of both communities to restore law and order, to put
an end to intersectarian violence, and to administer a shock in the hope
of forcing both factions to realise the necessity of an agreed political

solution.

We have borne in mind the need to define a clear political

objective, and to link military operations with a political initiative
directed towards that objective.

If the course of action contemplated

did not achieve this result, the imposition of a political settlement

B.

As to the conduct of the operation itself, Annex A describes a plan

for an initial saturation of critical urban areas providing strongholds
for extremists or offering particular scope for intersectarian violence;
followed by the provision of coverage for other areas.

An important

question is whether this should be accompanied by a general search of all
premises for arms and explosives,
most rigorous means.

and a ban on movement enforced by the

Experience shows, however, that an indiscriminate

search of premises for arms is hardly ever productive;

and that a more

effective method of obtaining information about arms would be to arrest
and interrogate persons believed to have knowledge of their whereabouts,
along with a more selective policy of searching premises for wanted

individuals and arms.

It is hoped that the selection of individuals for

questioning would now be considerably more accurate than in the internment
operation of

9 August 1971;

but it must be recognised that only a limited

proportion of unlicensed arms (most of which are held by Roman Catholics)
would be recovered.

We haveassumed that in general arrests will fall

into three categories:(a)

Persons whom it is intended to detain for up to

5

days for

questioning.
(b)

Persons against whom it is intended to prefer criminal
charges, including the unauthorised holding of firearms.

(c)

Persons whom it is desired to intern (or detain for more than

5 days for purposes other than interrogation),
decided that a policy of internment will not

political objectives of the operation.

We conclude that an operation on the lines discussed is militarily

feasible provided that Ministers accept the implications described below;
and that it could be mounted within ten days of a Ministerial decision to
launch it, provided that the necessary legislative measures could be

introduced in advance of the completion of the build-up and passed through
Parliament

without delay.

Implications
16.

We believe

before adopting this completely new approach,
Ministers should be aware of the following implications, all of which
that,

are likely to arise to a greater or lesser extent as indicated in the
following paragraphs or in the Annexes:(a)

the disruption of the life of Northern Ireland for which the
security forces will be held responsible;

(b)

the loss of life and damage to property virtually certain to
be inflicted by the security forces upon persons not themselves
guilty of violence or terrorism;

(c)

the operation will in our opinion harden the polarisation of
the two main factions and the alienation, certainly of the
Roman Catholic community and probably of the Protestants as
well, from the British connexion;

(d)

a need to resort again to internment, possibly on a large
scale and certainly with a sectarian imbalance that would be

represented as evidence of anti-Catholic bias;
(e)

a substantial requirement for legislation, which would need to
be passed rapidly but which would contain elements unlikely to
command bi-partisan support or to be accepted by Parliament
without extensive discussion;

(f)

a need to seek legislation to indemnify Crown servants in

respect of actions whose scope it will be impossible to define;

6470,PREM_15_1010_175,"One point outstanding from the Meeting's previous discussion of
the Attorney General's memorandum GEN 79(72) 8 was his recommendation
(paragraph 26) that for the present there should not be any

statutory

indemnity for members of the security forces in either civil or criminal
matters.

2.

A similar view has been reached by officials in the report now

presented for discussion.

Officials point out that the question of

indemnity only arises when the wide powers conferred under the Special
Powers Acts are exceeded;

that there are obvious objections to the

enactment of a general indemnity before order has been restored and all
detainees released;

and that any form of indemnity which appreciably

abridges existing domestic remedies in respect of the breaches of the
Human Rights Convention alleged by the Government of the Republic
would undermine our case against the admissibility of the allegations
before the Commission at Strasbourg.

They consider that, if we find

ourselves confronted with a spate of private prosecutions or civil actions
giving rise to security problems or other major embarrassments, an
Act which went no further than barring private prosecutions and
transferring compensation jurisdiction from the courts to administrative
tribunals would raise fewer problems in Parliament and at Strasbourg;
but that, unless we are so confronted,

it would be best to wait until order

has been restored before considering whether an act of indemnity would be
appropriate.

You lave yourself made the point that one of the reasons for the

imposition of direct United Kingdom rule in Northern Ireland has been the
need to ensure that the rule of law operates there as in the rest of the

6519,PREM_15_1689_019,"THE PRIME MINISTER said that the purpose of the discussion should be
to consider the forthcoming White Paper, particularly in relation to
what it would say about the formation of an Executive within the
Northern Ireland Assembly and about a Council of Ireland; and timing.
The events of 7 February, when the Protestant extremists forced widespread strikes, particularly in Belfast

which were accompanied by

serious outbreaks of violence, had led to a reaction by the moderate
Protestants.

An important development had been the joint approach to

the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 9 February by the
leaders of the Unionist, Independent Unionist, Northern Ireland Labour
and Alliance Parties (Mr Faulkner, Mr Paisley, Mr Simpson and Mr O'Neill)
who had pledged their support for any measures he might take to suppress
violence and maintain order.

A contributing

factor in the outburst of

7 February had been the arrest of a small group of Protestant extremists.
The arrest of a larger number after 7 February, some of whom had been
subjected to detention orders and others charged, had not led to
trouble.

Action against extremists would continue.

These developments had a bearing upon the timing and the content of the
White Paper.

Other factors were the decision of the Prime Minister of

Ireland, Mr Lynch, to hold a General Election on 28 February, which
argued against publishing the White Paper before that date; and the
importance of settling the constitutional arrangements in Northern
Ireland, if possible, well in advance of a General Election in the
United Kingdom.

This last consideration might argue in favour of a

clear definition of the constitution in the White Paper, rather than
an evolutionary approach which would leave the details to be discussed
with the Northern Ireland Assembly when it was created through elections
towards the end of this year.
Strong action against Protestant extremists must be accompanied by
continuing action against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).
If Mr Lynch were re-elected he might be prepared to do more against
them in the South.

We needed an assessment of how far and howquickly

he might be willing to move against them and of how much, in practice,
he would be able to do so.

SUMMARY OF SECURITY FORCES ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE OPERATION MOTORMAN
31 JULY - 31 DECEMBER 1972
1.
Despite the withdrawal of nine IS battalions since the implementation of
Operation MOTORMAN, Phase 3 of the operation, the build up of intelligence and
the removal of key terrorists, continues. Though neutralisation of the IRA
has not been completely achieved, vigorous and successful actions by the
Security Forces have seriously reduced the IRA's morale and made the most
encouraging inroads into their command structure. Simultaneously, with the
development of Protestant militancy and a more general polarisation of the
communities, SF have had to look to both directions and a good deal of military
effort has been devoted to counteracting extreme Protestant groups. Some
measure of the endeavour is reflected in the following statistics which cover
the period since Operation MOTORMAN was launched (31 July) to the end of 1972:

5.
The strength of the UDR as at 31 December 1972 was 8,959. This represents
a decrease of 197 on the previous month. This decrease is as a result of less
applications( and the new policy to weed out those members who have a poor
attendance record.
DETENTION
6.
By 29 December the Commissioners had reviewed the cases of 167 men who had
been interned and ordered the release of 63. The following remain interned/
detained as at 31 December 1972:
a.
10 interned under the previous powers whose cases have not yet
been reviewed by the Commissioners.
b.
106 detained under the previous powers whose cases have not yet
teen reviewed by the Commissioners.
c.
104 who were previously interned and whose cases have been
reviewed by the Commissioners who have ordered that they should be
detained.
d.
72 detained since the introduction of the Commission and held under
interim custody orders until their cases are heard by the Commissioners.
It should be noted that since the introduction of the ""Detention of Terrorists""
(Northern Ireland) Order 1972 on 7 November 1972 there have been 265 arrests
with a view to possible detention. Apart from the 72 who have had interim
custody orders served on them, a further 17 have had criminal charges brought
against them.
CEASEFIRE POLICY
7.
It is possible that the Provisional IRA, as part of their plan to gain
political respectability, will try to reach a negotiated truce. Mr Whitelaw has
said that he will not negotiate with the Provisionals again as their behaviour
towards the ceasefire of June/July 1972 has-demonstrated that they are completely
untrustworthy. Therefore the Secretaries of State for Defence and Northern Ireland
have agreed that in future, should the Provisionals express a wish for a ceasefire,

they should be advised to cease firing. The Security Forces would continue to
take action against those who break the law or who engage in terrorist activities.
In fact for the Army it would be ""business as usual"" at least until there were

real signs of the intention of a ceasefire being translated into fact. Should
this good faith be exhibited then clearly political and military activity would
be reconsidered.

6660,PREM_15_1689_160,"PROPAGANDA
8.
With the continuing numbers of unexplained murders IRA propaganda and
Catholics generally have been quick to refer to these as sectarian murders
and attribute them to Protestant extremists and in some cases Army Assassination
Squads. While it is true that about twice as many Catholics as Protestants have
been murdered this year it is not true that all those are the work of the UVF/UDA,
some are almost certainly IRA punishments and others straight criminal activity.
We therefore do not favour the expression ""sectarian"" murders. Nor do we want
to encourage the propaganda deduction that ""the Security Forces do not protect
you, the Catholics, from the murdering Protestants and therefore we, the IRA
(Provisional or Official), will defend you and you must support us"". Immediate
steps have been taken operationally to counter this spate of murders the most
notable of which was the formation of a joint RUC/RMP Task Force initially
operating in East Belfast. 50 RMP with an equal number of RUC have been specially
charged with investigating these murders and with preventing further cases. The
force is assisted by an extension of the anonymous telephone-in facility (robotphone).
9.

From the Army's point of view the most serious propaganda attacks have been

charges that Army morale is sagging. The basis for this assessment is the
publicity given to discharge by purchase rates in 2 PARA and the conviction by
court martial of 4 soldiers of 3 RRF for drug offences. Guidance on these two
subjects has been issued, but. briefly,the number of discharge by purchase applications
in 2 PRA is not considered exceptional in view of the freeze during their tour
in Northern Ireland; and a total of 90 convictions of soldiers by court martial
and 16 in civil courts for drug offences in 1972 is not high considering the
seriousness with which even minor infringements are viewed. The majority of
cases involve cannabis. Of course frequent service in Northern Ireland has an
effect on soldiers, but there is no evidence that this has resulted in a loss of
morale nor that is has affected operational efficiency.
LEGAL PROCEDURES
10. Lord Diplock has presented the report of his Commission on legal procedures
to deal with terrorist activities and the Government has announced its intention
to implement his recommendations. Legislation is therefore being prepared and
this may include those emergency powers which will still be required if the
Government decides to repeal the Special Powers Act. The Commission recognised
that there was a continuing need for detention by the executive, but they proposed,

amongst other things, various changes in court procedures which will be of
considerable assistance to the Security Forces. The most significant of these are
the trial of terrorist offences by a judge sitting alone, restrictions on the granting of
bail and the admissibility of confessions and certain written statements.
DIRECTIVES
11. CGS issued his Directive to the GOC in the form outlined in the Monthly
Report for November. As a result CLF issued a revised Directive for future
operations to cover the period until the publication of the White Paper. He
gave as his mission:

""In closest co-operation with the RUC, the Army in Northern Ireland is
progressively to diminish the ability of extremist organisations and their
followers to influence political events or to terrorise any section of
the population.""
CLF gave the three brigades the following tasks in order of priority:
a.

To continue the attrition of the IRA's will and capacity to continue

their campaign.
To protect and be seen to protect sections of the community who are,
b.
or who believe themselves to be, threatened.

you would like that sort of approach, but it is either an
approach between governments - if there were to be an

MR. LYNCH
Well, it is very difficult for us to have a summit
without a reasonable prospect of some kind of the product
and that would mean in effect a political product, so to
speak. And I doubt if Mr. Faulkner would be very much
interested in a summit of that nature.
PRIME MINISTER
I think his view has been right from the time he
became Prime Minister as you know that he wanted to
have more contacts with you and with Dublin and to build
them up gradually. And the whole point about internment
is to deal with the terrorism so that it is then possible
to make the advance on other fronts. Until he is able
to deal ith the bomb explosions and the destruction of
property and the general terrorism it is impossible for
him to go further than he has gone already.
MR. LYNCH
And of course there is this difficulty, that producing
these results now, in the light of the activities of the
IRA in the north, could be attributed to their activities
rather than to reasonable and reasoned discussion. That
is a big difficulty we have her with the Opposition M.P.'s

DR. HILLERY'S DISCUSSION WITH THE HOME SECRETARY

Note of a meeting at the Home Office on Wednesday 11th August

Present:

Home Secretary
Mr. Godber (Minister of
State, Foreign Office)
Sir Philip Allen
Sir Stewart Crawford
Mr. Angel

Dr. Hillery (Minister for Foreign
Affairs, Irish Republic)
Dr. O'Sullivan (Irish Ambassador)

Dr. Hillery said that he had been sent by his Cabinet to see the British
Government.

He thought the current policies would lead to war in Ireland, not

only the North.

He said that the IRA had been re-created as a reaction to the

British Government's policies of preserving the dominance of the Orange Order.
He claimed that the Orange Order still ran the Northern Ireland Government and
referred to Mr. Faulkner as having gone to a secret meeting of the Orange Lodge
for instructions before visiting London.

He said that following these

policies would destroy relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic
and claimed that the urgency of the situation was not appreciated by the United
Kingdom Government.
The Home Secretary said that the policy of the United Kingdom Government
was to support the lawfully and democratically elected Government in Northern
Ireland.

He pointed out that the Northern Ireland Government had introduced

a major reform programme and that Mr. Faulkner had only recently taken a
major initiative, without first consulting Westminster, in suggesting
Parliamentary committees to provide greater participation by the minority.
right road was to seek to make this progress better appreciated, not to decry
it.

Internment had been introduced because the Government was faced with

terrorism on an intolerable scale.

It was in the common interest of both

countries to combat the activities of gunmen and it was hoped that the
Government of the Republic would be able to help achieve that objective.

6831,PREM_15_478_144,"Dr. Hillery suggested that recent activity by the army was the ""reign of
terror"" promised by Mr. John Taylor.

He suggested that the policy of the army

was to shoot on suspicion and gave the two deaths in Derry as examples of
this.

The Home Secretary said thatthe army was under the control of

Westminster.

He knew that the orders given to the soldiers provided for them

to act impartially and he was satisfied that they did not shoot without reason.
Dr. Hillery said that the army had originally gone into Northern Ireland to
protect the Catholics but its role had changed and the Catholics now saw the
army as having taken the place of the 'B' Specials.

He said that the raid on

the Falls Road, which had been peaceful for a year after the army had moved in,
was a critical mistake.

The Home Secretary said that it was not that the

role of the army had changed but that circumstances had changed in that the
army found itself attacked by terrorists from Catholic areas.

The soldier

did not know or care about the affiliations of someone sniping at him.

He

emphasised that the bombing, the murder and the withdrawal of the Opposition
from Stormont had all taken place before internment had been introduced.
The Home Secretary suggested that the IRA had deliberately intensified
operations to frustrate progress which was being made earlier this year.

While

posing as protectors of the Catholic community they were bringing it death and
destruction.
Dr. Hillery suggested that those interned were mostly talkers rather than
terrorists.

He complained that only Catholics had been interned and argued

that Protestant snipers who had killed in the past couple of nights had not been
dealt with.

He referred to the number of licensed guns in Protestant hands

and alleged that the police and army have stated that they will not go to
certain areas where Catholics might need to be protected.

The Home Secretary

replied that all those arrested under the internment operation were people
who the security forces believed to be active in terrorism.

Some might also

be engaged in more reputable political activity but this was not a reason for
their internment.

As the terrorism was conducted by the IRA it followed that

If Protestants engaged in terrorism they too would

be dealt with;

so far there was no infomation to confirm that Protestants had

been sniping.

Dr. Hillery intervened to refer to 2,200 refugees in camps in

the Republic.

The Home Secretary replied that if it were not for the IRA

campaign these people would still be in their own homes.

It should be clearly

understood that they were the victims of the IRA.
The Home Secretary said that he must ask Dr. Hillery to do all he could to
help in the campaign against the IRA who train, organise and find refuge south
of the border.

Dr. Hillery said that this could not be proved.

The Home

Secretary referred to two incidents in one of which a member of the UDR had
been shot dead from across the border and stated that Brady and Goulding
gloried in their activities from the sanctity of the Republic.

It would be politically impossible for the Irish

Government to take action against the IRA which would appear to be for the
benefit of the Unionists in Stormont.

Internment in the South had not been

absolutely ruled out but there was no intention of introducing it, unless it
could be presented as part of a move towards a united Ireland.

In stressing

the political difficulties facing his Government, Dr. Hillery said that for
two years Mr. Lynch""had been seen to drift along on a half hope all of his
own creation"".
The Home Secretary said that he had been told by many eminent Catholics
that the reform programme now being carried out removed genuine grievances.
The Home Secretary said that he was intent on sustaining the Parliament
of Northern Ireland, not as an instrument of Unionist domination but as a
democratically elected assembly through which the opportunities of participation
for the minority, as suggested by Mr. Faulkner, might be possible.

This

position was one of justice and reality, bearing in mind that the Catholic
community in Northern Ireland was a minority.

1. MR FAULKNER, THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND, ANNOUNCED
THIS MORNING, 9 AUGUST, THAT AFTER WEIGHING ALL THE RELEVANT
CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING THE VIEWS OF THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES,
AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN
IRELAND COVERNENT HAD DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT.
THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED
OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORISM, AT THE SAME TIME A BAN ON
ALL MARCHES AND PARADES WAS ANNOUNCED: THIS BAN, WHICH IS
INITIALLY FOR-SIX MONTHS, COVERS A MAJOR PROTESTANT EVENT
WHICH HAD BEEN DUE THIS WEEK, THE APPRENTICE BOYS' MARCH IN
LONDONDERRY.
2. THIS DECISION HAS BEEN MADE IN THE LIGHT OF IRA ACTIVITY
WHICH HAS INCREASED BOTH IN VOLUME AND IN THE VICIOUSNESS OF
THE ATTACKS ON THE SECURITY FORCES AND SOCIETY IN NORTHERN
IRELAND. IN ADDITION TO THOSE KILLED BY GUNMEN, EXPLOSIVES
HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST POLICE STATIONS, AND ALSO BARS, AND OTHER
PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CASUALTIES AMONGST ORDINARY CITIZENS WERE
INEVITABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN
THE WEIGHT AND QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES BEING USED, AND A
CROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL PREMISES IN BELFAST.
THESE HAVE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL-PLANNED OPERATIONS
BY GANGS OF UP TO A DOZEN MEN, WHICH SHOWS THE GROWING CONFIDENCE
-WITH WHICH THE IRA IS NOW OPERATING. ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES
A DELIBERATE IRA POLICY TO DISTURB SOCIETY IN THE NORTH, DESTROY
ECONOMIC LIFE AND DISCREDIT THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT,
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
3. ALL IMMEDIATE ADDRESSEES SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE FOREGOING
IS AS APPROPRIATE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT
TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCREDITED, AND THE REASONS BEHIND THE DECISION
APPRECIATED. OTHER POSTS HAVE DISCRETION TO DO LIKEWISE. ALL
SHOULD IN ADDITION ENSURE THAT.PRESS AND TV ARE FULLY BRIEFED.

",9 august  1 mr faulkner the prime minister of northern ireland announced this morning 9 august that after weighing all the relevant considerations including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with the british government the northern ireland covernent had decided to activate its powers of internment the security forces are accordingly detaining people suspected of responsibility for terrorism at the same time a ban on all marches and parades was announced this ban which is initially forsix months covers a major protestant event which had been due this week the apprentice boys march in londonderry 2 this decision has been made in the light of ira activity which has increased both in volume and in the viciousness of the attacks on the security forces and society in northern ireland in addition to those killed by gunmen explosives have been used against police stations and also bars and other public places where casualties amongst ordinary citizens were inevitable additionally there has been a marked increase in the weight and quantity of explosives being used and a crowing number of attacks on commercial premises in belfast these have included for the first time wellplanned operations by gangs of up to a dozen men which shows the growing confidence with which the ira is now operating all the evidence indicates a deliberate ira policy to disturb society in the north destroy economic life and discredit the stormont government instructions for use 3 all immediate addressees should ensure that the foregoing is as appropriate brought to the attention of the government to which they are accredited and the reasons behind the decision appreciated other posts have discretion to do likewise all should in addition ensure thatpress and tv are fully briefed

IMMEDIATE TO UKREP BELFAST.
1. MY TELS NOS 307 AND 308 REFELECT THE CENTRAL PUBLIC REACTIONS
IN THE REPUBLIC TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE INTERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT.
IRISH MINISTERS RECALLED FROM THEIR HOLIDAYS HAVE BEER MEETING
THIS MORNING, AFTER WHAT, ONE HOPES, WILL PROVE TO HAVE BEEN THE
WORST. NIGHT IN THE NORTH. THIS TELEGRAM IS MY ATTEMPT TO PICK OUT
THE SALIENT POINTS IN A STILL VERY FLUID SITUATION AND FORECAST
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAPPEN.
2. MR LYNCH' ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE IS VERY LIMITED. IF THE DAILY
WERE RECALLED AND THERE WERE A DIVISION ON HIS POLICY TOWARDS
THE NORTH AS HITHERTO FORMULATED, THE HARDL-LINERS IN FIANNA FAIL
WOULD PROBABLY DEFECT AND HE WOULD BE DEFEATED. IF BY THE END OF
OCTOBER INTERNMENT IS STILL IN FORCE WITH NO VISIBLE CHANGE IN
THE LOT OF THE CATHOLICS, HE WILL BE HARD PUT TO IT TO SURVIVE.
3. HE HAS NOT BUDGED AN INCH FROM HIS PREVIOUSLY STATED VIEWS
ON THE USE OF FORCE AND THE NECESSITY FOR PEACEFUL CHANGE IN THE
NORTH. BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT, AGAINST HIS ADVICE
AND WITH THE APPARENT SHORT-TERM CONSEQUENCE OF UNITING ALL
THE IRISH CATHOLICS NORTH AND SOUTH AGAINST US, FORCES HIM
INTO A VERY TIGHT CORNER. IN THIS SITUATION IT IS NOTEWORTHY
THAT IN PUBLIC HE HAS NOT EXCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERNMENT
BECOMING NECESSARY IN THE SOUTH.
4. PRIVATELY, HE WOULD PROBABLY BE GLAD TO BE PROVED WRONG AND,
WITH THE I R A LEADERS OUT OF THE WAY, SEE THE CATHOLIC MINORITY
SETTLING DOWN TO A PEACEFUL LIFE IN THE NORTHERN COMMUNITY.
5. UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER NOBODY THAT I HAVE MET CAN SEE ANY REASON
WHY THEY SHOULD, OR WHY THEY SHOULD PUT ANY FAITH IN MR FAULKNER'S
WORD TO HIS '' CATHOLIC FELLOW COUNTRYMEN'' IN HIS STATEMENT
ON INTERNMENT. AND THE FACT OF INTERNMENT, TAKEN BY ITSELF, DOES
NOTHING TO REMOVE THEIR SCEPTICISM. THE ATTITUDE OF THOUGHTFUL
AND WELL DISPOSED IRISHMEN IS THAT INTERNMENT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE
ACT DESIGNED TO HELP EXECUTE A POLICY: AND THAT POLICY IS

CAMPS IN THE SOUTH AND CALL FOR A CONFERENCE OF ALL INTERESTED
PARTIES ON THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH.
6. I CANNOT OF COURSE COMMENT ON THE EFFECT IN THE NORTH, BUT
I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE A STEADYING EFFECT IN THE SOUTH IF, IN
ADDITION TO THE DETAILS SUGGESTED IN MY TEL NO 302, H.M.G. COULD
TAKE UP MR FAULKNER'S APPEAL TO THE CATHOLICS (FINAL PARAGRAPH
OF HIS STATEMENT OF 9 AUGUST) BY STATING VERY CLEARLY THAT
INTERNMENT IS ONLY A MEANS TO AN END AND THAT THIS END IS THE
RAPID CREATION OF A SOCIETY FROM WHICH DISCRIMINATION AND INJUSTICE
HAD BEEN ELIMINATED. IF H.M.G. CAN COMMIT THEMSELVES PUBLICLY
TO A GUARANTEE THAT MR FAULKNER'S FINE WORDS WILL BE RAPIDLY
TRANSLATED INTO SPECIFIC AND PRACTICAL AS DISTINCT FROM PAPER
REFORMS, INTERNMENT WILL BE SEEN HERE TO HAVE AN EXPLICIT
POSITIVE PURPOSE AS WELL AS THE NEGATIVE ONE OF ENDING TERRORISM,

THE HOME SECRETARY AND MR GODBER TOMORROW. MINISTERS HAVE BEEN

LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS, THOUGH THE EXTENSION BEYOND SIX MONTHS
REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

AND I AM WELL AWARE
AS THEIR ADVANTAGES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND:

IF YOU HAD FELT ABLE TO TAKE SIMILAR MEASURES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE
BORDER. BUT I JUDGED FROM OUR AMBASSADOR'S REPORT OF HIS RECENT
TALK WITH YOU THAT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF THAT, AND I COULD NOT
THEREFORE HOLD OUT THIS POSSIBILITY AS AN INDUCEMENT TO FAULKNER
TO HOLD H IS HAND.
8. WE HAVE HOWEVER MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT THE MEASURES TAKEN
SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE
COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE.
THE MARCHES DUE IN DERRY ON 12 AUGUST AND IN BELFAST AT THE END
OF THE MONTH WILL NOT NOW TAKE PLACE.
AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL
BE SET UP, TO WHICH ANY ONE WHO IS INTERNED WILL HAVE THE RIGHT
TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS

FOUND NECESSARY.

YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REACT TO THEM WITH UNDERSTANDING, EVEN IF
WITH REGRET. THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL CALL FOR VIOLENT ACTION
IN RESPONSE TO THESE MEASURES: A REMINDER FROM YOU THAT VIOLENCE
SERVES NO PURPOSE, AND THAT INTERNMENT IS AIMED AGAINST PARTICULAR

I have said, you will be able to react to them with
understanding, even if with regret.

who will call for violent action in response to these
measures;

a reminder from you that violence serves no

purpose, and that internment is aimed against particular
individuals who are avowedly working for a breakdown of

TO RESIST THE PRESSURES ONHIM FOR MORE DRASTIC ACTION TO ARREST

THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FORCES ARE COMMITED IN NORTHERN IRELAND,
AND THE IMPLICATION OF THAT FOR OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY

TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT IT, IF IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE
AND WE HAVE MADE CLEAR
BAN ON MARCHES AND PARADES OF ALL KINDS:
OUR PRESENT VIEW THAT THAT BAN WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN FORCE

FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS, ALTHOUGH THE EXTENSION AFTER SIX
MONTHS REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

Faulkner's

judgment was that the consequences of that for the community
would be worse than the consequences of what is now

There is also the fact that the intimidation

of the population by the terrorists has been increasingly
hampering the process of gathering intelligence
6.

The decision is, of course, Faulkner's, since the

powers under which these measures are taken are powers of
the Northern Ireland Government.

But implementation

depends upon the co-operation of the units of the British
Army in Northern Ireland, and he has decided as he always
said he would, after consultation with us.

For our part,

we are of course very concerned about the degree to which
our Forces are committed in Northern Ireland, and the
implication of that for our military capability elsewhere.
If this move enables us to reduce the number of troops
committed to Northern Ireland earlier than we could otherwise
have done, that will be a welcome consequence of it.

and

we have made clear our present view that that ban will
need to remain in force for longer than six months, although
the extension after six months remains formally open for
discussion.
7.

We realise, of course, that these decisions carry

their dangers as well as their advantages in Northern
Ireland;

and I am also very well aware of their implications

for the Irish Republic.

We have made clear our view that

the measures taken should not discriminate as between the
different sections of the community, except as the facts of
the situation make inevitable.

The marches due in Derry

on 12 August and in Belfast at the end of the month will not
take place.

An advisory committee will be set up, to which

any one who is interned will have the right to make
representations.
8.

The effectiveness of internment north of the border

would be greater if the Irish Government were prepared to
introduce internment south of the border at the same time;
but all that we know of the Irish Government's policies
suggeststhat there is no possibility of parallel action
south of the border.

It would be for them to take into account the political considerations which
are numerous and complex.

This remains our position.

We must look at the immediate situation against the background of the
Apprentice Boys march on 12 August.

If internment were introduced before then

it would in our view be essential to proceed simultaneously with the indefinite
banning of all political processions.

I understand it is the GOC's view on

military grounds that he would not advise the banning of the procession.

If the

procession is to proceed it seems to me to be wiser to postpone any decision
about internment until after it has taken place when we can review the situation
again on the existing principles and wholly without prejudice to a decision
either way.

As so much attention has been paid to this march on 12 August its

outcome one way or another will be of considerale significance for any decision
about the future conduct of the campaign against the terrorists.
This is the position as I see it.
As I said,

I should be most grateful for your comments.

I would be very happy to see you if you would care to come and discuss

it here but I rather share your view that the publicity attending such a visit

although it would be unlikely to put an end to terrorism completely.

But

it would also lead to retaliation, not only in the form of rioting but also by
way of taking hostages both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.

You

will want specifically to ascertain the views of the GOC and the Chief
Constable.

It seems essential that a decision to intern should be accompanied

by a ban of the Apprentice Boys' march on 12th August.
Political Impact in Northern Ireland

Internment would strengthen Mr. Faulkner's position;

but at some

Mr. Lynch is probably right in saying that it would lead

to greater polarisation of opinion and that it would make it harder to
promote policies of co-operation and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.

Up to 150 could be taken at

we would be able to take (about 250) until Long Kesh was ready.

You will wish to enquire about the procedure:

whether the suspects

would immediately be interned or held pending internment or trial on a
criminal charge.

Has the Home Secretary any idea how long internment

would be likely to last?

Could the courts cope?

And what machinery is

there for reviewing cases ?

There

There was a strong view at Cabinet last week

that internment should precede direct rule, particularly since we might well
be creating subsequent political embarrassment for ourselves if we needed,
under direct rule, to use a weapon which we had earlier denied to the
Northern Ireland Government.

But this assumes that events will allow

us to move in orderly sequence from harassment to internment and from
internment to direct rule.

And this may not be so.

However reluctant

we may be to adopt internment, we must not leave it too late and expose
ourselves

to the charge that it might have made all the difference (to the

lives of British soldiers,

among other things) if only we had introduced it

in time.
9.

On the second

issue the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary argued

that the response of Mr. Lynch should not be the sole criterion for taking the
decision on internment.

True: but we must still have regard to his views

and

the Official Committee have therefore considered how an approach might best
be made to the Government of the Republic.

They could be approached only

when a provisional decision had been taken to agree to internment in the North.
But that kind of approach was thought likely to be unproductive;

especially

since the information would leak before internment had actually begun and
this would jeopardise the success

of the operation.

the view of the Official Committee,

The better course,

in

would be to approach Mr. Lynch soon

after 12th August on the footing that internment was a possibility which we
had to consider.

Even so,

he would be unlikely to agree to adopt it in the

South, unless we could persuade him that it was to his own advantage.

The

Official Committee therefore recommended that HM Ambassador in Dublin
should be informed of our thinking at once in order that he might advise us
about the best approach;

and telegrams have been sent to him accordingly.

The main factors involved are:(a)

The outcome of 12th August in Londonderry.

If the march is not

banned and there is serious trouble as a result, internment will become
a more pressing issue;

but Mr. Lynch may be more reluctant to collaborate

than if we had banned the march.
(b)

The future of the proposal for a full-time unit of the UDR.

to form such a unit would not help us in talking to Mr. Lynch.

the increased level of IRA terrorism
in the light of two factors:
during recent weeks, and the march of the Protestant Apprentice
Boys which traditionally takes place in Londonderry on 12th
August.
The Prime Minister will wish to be aware of the
conclusions which have been reached.
As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there
has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount
and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with
frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the
outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry
where there had previously been very little trouble for many
and the
months.
This activity is clearly the work of the IRA;
GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting
better organised and more efficient in its methods.
Earlier
this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also
to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up
within Mr. Faulkner's Government for firm action against the
IRA;
and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home
Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again
about internment.
It would be primarily a political decision whether to
bring in internment, but it would depend very much on military

view at Stormont is that the march should be allowed to take
place, but that the traditional route must certainly be altered
so as to avoid the city walls where they look down on the Bogside
(which has proved a flash-point in the past, not least in 1969).
It is thought that the march organisers are much more likely
to be prepared to cooperate in such re-routing if, in the
meantime, some positive action is seen to be taken against
IRA leaders.
The GOCtherefore plans to make a start with the
harassment tactics before the end of this month (which will
of course be presented as a response to the recent outbreaks
of violence)and he will shortly be reporting the details
of these plans.
