The arrest of eight men last night, four of whom were on a ’wanted’ list, 
raises the question in what circumstances such arrests should be made. Three of the men are thought to be senior officers of the Belfast Provisionals. The question is which people should be arrested and for what purposes; criminal charges, questioning under the Special Powers Act, or in rare cases detention or internment. The Northern Ireland Office will arrange for the subject to be considered by the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland.
