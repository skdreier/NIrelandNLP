LONDONDERRY 3. 
There were 2 shooting incidents, and one hit was claimed. In the Creggan 
ATO blew up a car containing about 15 lbs explosive. At 2102 hrs in Creggan Heights there was an explosion in the garden of a house followed two minutes later by another in the next door garden. The houses are occupied by two RC brothers and it is thought one of them had given offence to the IRA. SF did not follow up immediately as a crowd of about 40 set fire to a vehicle nearby and SF wished to avoid a confrontation. There was an organised stoning attack by 100 hooligans on Creggan camp. Two baton rounds were fired and a water cannon was used to disperse the youths. James ’Doc’ Docherty was arrested under SPA 11. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4.

Crossmaglen about 100 rounds were fired from Eire, at a 1 A & SH patrol by 2 gunmen, armed with an M1 and a Garrard rifle. A helicopter observing the incident saw the gunmen in Eire and was fired at. 105 rounds were returned and there were no casualties or hits. The gunmen escaped by car towards Dundalk and the Gardai were informed. At Gortin Co Tyrone, ATO blew up 3 x 50 lbs milk churn devices. A soldier of 11 UDR reported that he had lost his .38 pistol and 5 rounds. It is thought that the weapon was stolen from his house. There was activity by Vanguard and UDA in Lisburn but there was no trouble.

3. IRA Activity. Reports continue to indicate that Provisional morale is low 
and that they have found it increasingly difficult to operate due to SF domination. They have been further hampered by selective arrests and subsequent detention of senior officers the most important of which was Cornelius McHugh, the Operations Officer of the 1st Battalion in Belfast. 
Though IRA activities have to some 
extent been reduced during the week reports of a forthcoming intesification of the sniping campaign have been received. 
4. Security Force Activity. The main feature of the week has been the 
contingency deployment of troops out of IRA dominated areas into Protestant areas. On three occasions during the week up to three company-sized groups were redeployed to deal with Tartan rioting either in the Shankill or East Belfast. 
The week has 
seen some excellent finds including 74 weapons. 5. 
Propaganda. 
into the Republic, the UDA propaganda effort has been maintained and even increased. A determined effort has been made to get the UDA into the headlines daily. 
Following last week’s claim of a successful raid over the border They 
have published a booklet attacking 1 PARA over the incidents in the Shankill Road in early September; they have even forecast that British troops will "run amok" in Protestant areas. 
from Vietnam as instructors in guerilla warfare. 
They have also stated that they are using US Army veterans The deaths of two Protestants 
on Monday night provided a propaganda platform from which the UDA are attempting to alienate the Protestant community from SF and Government. 
In comparison 
the propaganda efforts of Republicans have been slight and only appeared in the Republican orientated press.

Indications are that extreme Incidents during the week included the attempted 
murder of a Resident Magistrate, a successful booby-trap attack in a house in Armagh, and the shooting of an RUC constable on foot patrol in Belfast.

5. Propaganda. Following the death of Spr STEWART in the Four Square Laundry incident, our concern was to convince public opinion that this had been a highly successful operation in spite of its tragic ending, and that plain clothes surveillance operations by the Army were legitimate and valuable to the maintenance of security and ought to be continued. The IRA are anxious to portray such activities as ’SAS’ or ’Army assassination squads’ and to discredit them generally in the hope that public opinion will force HMG to discontinue them. One week after the event British public opinion seemed to be in our favour. Whilst Republicans continue to resent our plain clothes patrols, their confidence may have suffered as a result of them. However, further propaganda attacks will undoubtedly continue on this theme.

explosions three took place near crowded Catholic owned bars, killing two persons and injuring 18. One small explosion at a Catholic church in DUNDONALD and the petrol bombing of a Catholic school in BALLYACKAMORE were almost certainly Protestant in origin.

Security Forces in hard-core areas and five soldiers have been injured in these attacks. Following the killing on 2 October of a soldier engaged on a plain clothes patrol there has been a reaction from both factions of the IRA and from other Republican organisations. The Provisional IRA boasted responsibility for the murder and claimed that the operation had been under surveillance for some time. In a later statement on 5 October they claimed incorrectly to have shot not one but five agents on the same day, three in the laundry van and two others in the Antrim Road. Hooliganism continues including the stoning of a bus which caused the death of an innocent bystander on Tuesday. 
The majority of the 128 shooting incidents have again comprised sniping at 9. 
there are indications that one was a UDA murder of a suspected supplier of guns to the IRA, and one was a Provisional IRA murder probably through mistaken identity. 
Three civilians have been killed in unexplained shootings in the week, of these

UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 6 OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The rise in IRA activity shows signs of continuing. There were 13 
bomb incidents and 48 shootings, one of which was an attempt on the life of Mr Craig. 
CASUALTIES 2. MIL - 
9 injured (2 VSI) 
CIV - 2 killed (intersectarian) - IRA - 2 hits claimed. 
ARRESTS 3. 
FINDS 4. 
6 injured (1 intersectarian) Only routine ones made, except James TRAINOR (Adjt A Coy 3 Bn Provo). Some 8 weapons, assorted ammunition and explosive. 
IRA ACTIVITY 5. 
A bomb went off without warning in a Catholic Bar killing one and wounding 
several. 13 bomb attacks were spread throughout the Province but shootings mainly confined to city areas, though there were a couple of cross border shooting incidents. 
6. 7. An explosion successfully ut off electrical power to most of County 
Fermanagh. This is the first really successful ’black out’ resulting from many attacks on the supply system during the last year. 
Intimidation against individual members of the Press continues. 
PROTESTANT ACTIVITY 8. 
Credence to reports of Protestant attacks on isolated Catholic families 
living in Protestant areas are strengthened by the murder of a young Catholic at his home in Portadown. A grenade is believed to have been thrown through the window. 
9. Parties of UDA called on householders in Lisburn and ordered them to 
handover their PR voting forms which they then tore up. The UDA were masked and cudgelled.

killed a member of a plain clothes surveillance team posing as the driver of a sundry delivery van. This patrol was part of a most successful intelligence gathering operation which had, over the past few months, provided information which had been responsible for, either directly or indirectly, over 30% of the arrests of Provisional IRA officers in the Andersonstown area. A WRAC member of the patrol escaped unhurt. The IRA simultaneously raided a home which they believed to be the Headquarters of this unit. The Four Square Laundry Service, as it was called, has now been withdrawn. It was, incidentally, a popular laundry service offering good service at cut rates.

10. Sectarian Murders. These have continued at an average of one a day. Because of the impenetrable wall of silence which surrounds them the CID find most of their enquiries fruitless so that it is difficult to determine which are truly sectarian and which are the settling of old scores for other reasons. 
11. Bombs. During the week there were 15 explosions in the City amongst which were two particularly significant car bombs. The first, a 100 lb device, exploded outside the James Connelly Club killing ex detainee Patrick McKee, a Volunteer in the Provisional IRA. Whether planted by extreme Protestants or intended to exacerbate interfactional differences may never be known. The second car bomb loaded with approximately 200 lbs, exploded in Marlborough Street. Significantly, Security Forces arrested yet another recently released internee as he was seen to run away after getting out of the car. A further illustration of IRA ingenuity was the hiding of 200 lbs of explosive in a settee which was then delivered to a furniture warehouse by bombers posing as workmen. 
LONDONDERRY 
12. The city has remained quiet during the week with only 23 shooting incidents in which one soldier was very seriously injured and in another an RUC constable was slightly wounded. Although 9 bombs were found and defused there were only 4 explosions in the city, one of which was a device in the region of 600 lbs. Hooliganism in the form of stoning and bottling of patrols was considerably reduced compared to the previous week and at a ’Prayer for Peace’ meeting 1500 people were exhorted to keep the children off the streets. 
RURAL AND BORDER AREAS 
13. Rural. Security Forces have been fired on in rural towns notably Portadown, Armagh, Coalisland and Maghera but there has been no inordinate increase in terrorist activity. On 27 September a 100 lb bomb destroyed Armagh City Hall and others damaged premises in Armagh, Newry, Dungiven and Portadown. There have also been a number of minor stoning incidents in Armagh and several anti-Catholic hooligan attacks in Bangor. 
14. Cross Border Activity. In addition to continued attacks on electricity pylons, the most significant event was the IRA raid into Castlederg on 29 September. This raid, following so soon after the incident reported last week, in which a UDR soldier and his wife were murdered in their home on the Border, illustrates how easy it is for the terrorist to mount his activities from the Republic. 
OUTLOOK 
15. Provisionals may be expected to continue sniping attacks against the Security Forces in Belfast and the rural areas, and to continue to attempt to mine Security Force vehicles in the country. Although the rate may be raised in response to further Security Force successes, it is unlikely that the Provisionals have the capability in Belfast (given the reportedly weak state of the 1st/3rd Battalions) to sustain a much increased level of activity. In Londonderry, however, following the reported return of leading Provisionals from the Republic, an increase in activity may be expected.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 290700HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 to 020700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was higher than previous weekends over the last two 
months. On Fri/Sat there were 50 shootings and two explosions, on Sat/Sun 53 shooting incidents and 4 explosions. On Sun/Mon 27 shootings and one explosion. Casualties totaled 2 soldiers killed and 3 wounded ( 1 x VSI); 6 RUC wounded; 18 terrorists claimed hit, and 5 civilians killed and 30 wounded. Most of the trouble was in Belfast with Londonderry and the Rural areas relatively quiet. The major violence was in the Lower Falls area which continued throughout Friday afternoon and evening and seems to have been started by Provisional action against the Officials-this being a predominately Official area. The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces. 
This 
developed on Saturday into attacks on Security Force posts mainly in the Falls, but died away during the late evening with Sunday being mainly quiet. Meanwhile the Vanguard rally passed off without violence. ZU3 estimates of the attendance were 15000 including a parade of UDA members some wearing masks and carrying cudgels. 
Prayers for Peace meetings took place throughout the province. In Strasbourg it is reported that the European Commission for Human Rights has accepted the admissibility of the Irish Governments’ charges relating to interrogation and internment.

Hill and Springfield Road areas. In Londonderry, patrols report a reasonable reception from the locals although some children and the Derry Young Hooligans present an increasing nuisance factor. WRAC (Provost) are being used to search 
women in both cities. 5. 
Political. 
BELFAST 6. 
The Whitelaw Conference continues in Darlington at the time of 
writing. The SDLP declined to take part and the parties represented are the Unionist, Alliance and Northern Ireland Labour Party. 
The level of terrorist activity has remained relatively low each week 
throughout the month. However, following the arrest by Security Forces of Eddie Campbell (a Provisional Battalion Commander) on 20 September 1972, disturbances in the Ardoyne resulted in a gunman being shot dead and a second wounded. The incidence of both sniping and bombing attacks has been low. Despite considerable damage to the £21/2 million Russell Court Hotel no-one was seriously injured. However in one of three Protestant bombs planted outside a Republican Social Club beside Unity Flats, 29 civilians were injured one very seriously. No warning was given. No bombs were planted inside the Operation Segment area, the City Centre zone closely controlled by the Security Forces. On 24 September an antiinternment rally in Andersonstown attracted 2,000 protestors, a high attendance for this type of event in recent months. The UDA has continued to patrol in Belfast, particularly in the areas to the South of Andersonstown, and there has been some hardening in their attitude towards the Security Forces, particularly in their refusal to discard cudgels and masks. Two soldiers died of wounds during the week. 
LONDONDERRY 7. 
In the City there has beer an increase in the pattern of deliberate harrassment 
of Security Force patrols by children operating in sizeable groups. Shooting incidents remain at a low level and, although casualties are fewer than last week, one soldier has died from gunshot wounds. Constant checks of vehicles and pedestrian movement including the searching of females by the newly introduced WRAC (Provost) have reduced bomb attacks. Disturbances followed the arrest of Charles McSheffrey (OC Londonderry City Provisional IRA) on 22 September 1972, but these were short-lived due to speedy military intervention. McSheffrey has been charged for possession of an Armalite. Press reports, backed up by statements from John Hume MP indicate that the five ’Movement for Peace’ women have been subject to verbal and physical intimidation. There has been little Protestant activity in the Waterside though two masked UDA patrols dispersed and removed their masks when told to do so by the Security Forces. 
RURAL AND BORDER AREAS 8. 
The recent increase in bomb attacks in the rural and border areas has been 
maintained. Pylons, commercial premises and the Security Forces remain the principal targets. On 21 September 1972 an officer was shot dead and a soldier wounded whilst investigating a bomb on the border near Crossmaglen. Two RUC constables were ambushed and wounded whilst searching, with the Gardai, for a rifle lost in the previous incident. On the same day, a group of IRA thugs from the Republic attacked three UDR families close to the Fermanagh border, brutally murdering a private and his wife, and rapidly re-crossed the border cheering and blowing their motor horns. The level of activity in Strabane has slightly decreased during the last seven days but it still remains the most active area of the border. Besides sporadic shooting incidents the nearby Customs Post was blown up on 23 September 1972 and hooligans have roamed the streets of the town. Militant Loyalist activity has reduced, though the UDA have been in evidence in Larne, Carrickfergus, Greenisland and Lisburn. Portadown has not featured so

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 220700 to 250700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL The level of violence again showed no increase over previous weekends. 
On Fri/Sat there were 30 shootings and one confirmed explosion, on Sat/Sun 39 shootings 3 explosions and one border mine; and on Sun/Mon 25 shootings and 5 explosions. Casualties totaled one officer killed and four soldiers wounded (3 x VSI); three RUC wounded (1x VSI); eleven terrorists claimed hit, all in Catholic areas; and one civilian killed and one wounded. The principal events of the weekend were a serious border incident and the arrest of two prominent Provisionals on Fri/Sat; some intersectarian trouble in East BELFAST and the City Centre on Sat/Sun; and an anti-internment rally attended by 2000 in Andersonstown on Sunday, which passed with little incident. GB weekend press comment concentrated on the DARLINGTON talks, which begin today. The Observer carried an important article by Conor Cruise O’Brien. Elsewhere the European Human Rights Commission meets today in Strasbourg (in camera) to judge the admissibility of the Irish Republics’ case calling for an investigation of alleged brutality resulting from interrogation. In the Republic, the Justice Minister warned of ’tough and immediate measures to stamp out IRA terrorism after the recent trouble in DUNDALK. 
2. During Fri/Sat (22/23 Sep 72). There were 30 shooting incidents, 25 of which involved the SF who claimed one hit. In an incident on the border near Crossmaglen, Co Armagh, an officer of 1 A & SH was fatally wounded and a private of 1 A & SH and two RUC constables were wounded. One of the constables is critically ill. A separate report is at Annex A. Gdsm Fee of 2 SG was wounded in the neck and shoulder in Londonderry and is VSI. A subsequent follow up resulted in an Armalite being recovered. The body of a man (RC) was found in Belfast. There were no other military or civilian casualties. In Londonderry two men were captured with an Armalite one of whom was 
who 
was number 2 on the wanted list of IRA leaders in Londonderry. The customs caravan at Strabane was blown up and an explosion was heard in the Sion Mills area, but there were no other explosions during the period.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 22 SEPTEMBER 
OPERATIONS The member of the UDR who was murdered yesterday with his wife was killed 
by a group of about 10 men who came from the Republic and returned there. Whether this incident should be used by the Attorney General at Strasbourg, or in future discussions with the Irish Government, is being considered. 2. 
Two Customs Officers were kidnapped on Thursday morning. One is an RUC 
Reservist and the other a prosecution witness in a recent murder trial. 3. 
the bombing and sniping in Northern Ireland will continue. THE CONFERENCE 4. 
John Stephenson, speaking for the Provisionals in Dublin, has said that Information about the conference should be geared to showing that an 
opportunity is being provided for all points of view to be expressed, so that what flows from the conference will be seen to be the product of consultation. THE PROPOSED TRIBUNAL AND COMMISSION 5. 
Information about the tribunal should emphasise the steps that will be 
taken to separate the decision to detain a person from the executive. The detailed procedures for the tribunal have yet to be worked out between officials. PROSECUTIONS 6. 
Difficulties arise out of the preparation of criminal cases for prosecution 
in Northern Ireland. It may be that some legal advice within the RUC would improve this. The problem needs further consideration. STRASBOURG 7. 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have dealt with the security aspects of 
the hearings at Strasbourg next week. Daily reports of current events of importance will be sent from London. NEXT MEETING 8.

and additional commitments on the Protestant front, pressure continues to be applied to the ’hard IRA’ areas. This 
Security Forces Activity. Amidst reducing force levels profile survive hilst IRA activity remains lower than for 
any period since the ceasefire; but the additional presence required with the emergence of UVF terrorism will seriously stress deployment in IRA dominated enclaves. Intelligence improves and hence arrest of key terrorists and recovery of arms parallels this progress. Since Operation MOTORMAN, over 700 persons have been arrested of which approximately 300 have been charged. Frustrations continue to occur when apparently serious offenders are released on bail rather than being held on remand. The arrest figures on Provisional Officers to date are shown below. 
6. Political. The Europa Lodge Hotel in DARLINGTON, Co 
DURHAM has been selected as the venue for next week’s constitutional conference on Northern Ireland. It now seems certain that when the Conference gets under way on Monday 25 September only the Unionist, Labour and Alliance parties will be represented. The SDLP and the DUP, though refusing to attend the Conference, are expected to publish their proposals for the future Government of Northern Ireland before the talks begin. The Derry Nationalist Party announced its intention to contest the forthcoming local government elections. It is closely aligned to the Provisional IRA. In another attempt to enter the political arena, the Provisional IRA in LONDONDERRY have formed the Derry Defence Association. Despite the merger of Vanguard, UDA and LAW clear differences of opinion exist between the leaders. 
BELFAST 7. 
Sniping and bomb attacks remain at a similar level to the 
previous period, more accurate shooting has accounted for the still high casualty figures. The most concentrated attacks occurred on 14 September after the arrest of (OC B Company 2nd Battalion Provisional IRA). The number of unexplained attacks on civilians has increased and most of these victims have beep Catholics. Following one such incident on 17 September, 
, the OC of C Company 
UDA was arrested by Security Forces and has since been charged with attempted murder. The most serious of the explosions in the city is believed to have been a Protestant bomb planted outside a Catholic owned hotel frequented by IRA. The high casualty figures (3 killed and 50 injured) was largely due to the absence of warning, unusual in IRA inspired bombs. UDA masked patrols have been more active during the week, many of them armed with cudgels. The UDA rally on 16 September passed off peacefully as did the much smaller Vanguard rally on the same day. 
3 INFANTRY BRIGADE 8. 
Shooting in the rural areas has remained sporadic with 
incidents occurring in ARMAGH, DUNGANNON and PORTADOWN, although most of the activity was confined to the border areas. A number of pylons were felled in Co TYRONE. The main DUBLIN/ BELFAST railway line was slightly damaged by an explosion 600 metres north of the border and three large mines have been defused by ATO. Other mines have exploded harmlessly elsewhere

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 3 September 1972 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 
1. General. A number of events have held the headlines on the Irish scene during this period. The Protestant rioting of the first three nights of last week culminated inevitably in shooting between the Security Forces and UVF - 
inspired 
extremists in which two Protestants were killed and two wounded. Despite the deaths of 3 soldiers over the weekend caused by a Provisional mine, petulant Protestants are prepared to strike and demonstrate for the removal of the regiment they consider responsible for the deaths of their so-called innocent citizens. Much of the current terrorist activity is designed to promote the power of the faction concerned prior to the Secretary of State’s talks and, just as the UVF - 
inspired 
action was set up to show the strength of the Protestant front, further IRA atrocities can be expected to attempt to prove their domination of events. An extension of this ’jockeying’ is the emergence, after weeks of disarray, of a new hard line Protestant political party which unites the Vanguard, the para-military Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Association of Workers. It was significant that the tragedy of Munich aroused universal anger and condemnation even though Northern Ireland had endured death and destruction on a far greater scale without the spontaneous outflow of sympathy and the creation of the will to act internationally against terrorism. 
2. IRA Activity. Despite reports that the Provisional IRA campaign in Ulster would be intensified in order to disrupt the Secretary of State’s conference, it has remained subdued. The level of bomb attacks and snipings have remained at much the same level as last week. With the exception of the mining of a Saracen near Dungannon the Border has been virtually free of serious incidents. Although 8 soldiers were injured in 132 urban sniping incidents, there are indications that in Belfast the IRA’s reduced activity may be due to low morale in their battalions caused by the continued pressure of the current phase of Operation Motorman. 
3. Protestant Activity. Militant Protestant activity has dominated the situation during the week. On 7 September two civilians were shot dead and two wounded in the Shankill after Security Forces came under fire. In a statement on 8th September the UDA denied ’official involvement’ in the shooting although it was implicitly admitted that individual members acting without authority might have been involved. Nevertheless the UDA have used the incident to boost their flagging support and their already active propaganda campaign against the Security Forces. Furthermore, in a protest at the continued presence of the Parachute Regiment in the Shankill, the Belfast East and West Power Stations, largely staffed by member of LAW, are on strike. The activities of the UDA continue to pose a threat in the Portadown area; a number of cases of intimidation of Catholic families combined with a less friendly demeanour toward the Security Forces are all indications of the changed mood. 
4. Security Forces Activity. The domination of hard Catholic areas continues. Detention orders have been signed on a number of Provisionals. Large hauls of firearms and ammunition have been recovered in search operations which have become increasingly successful as more information is received from those members of the public who are becoming increasingly disaffected with the IRA.Battalions are beginning to know who and what is in their areas and the coming weeks should see more arrests and hence further inroads will be made into the IRA organisation. Patrolling continues in Border and Rural areas and, despite the tragic mining incident on Sunday, their success maybe measured in the significant reduction in explosives used, in the increased routine finds and the arrest figures produced by intensive alert patrolling.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 6 SEPTEMBER 1972 
Introduction 1. 
Provisional IRA. The shooting incidents continue to increase with sniping 
at patrols and sentries. Since 1 August there have been 174 single shot engagements at the Security Forces in which 8 soldiers were killed and 16 wounded. Security Force casualties, although lower than in any of the last 4 weeks, remain high at 3 killed and 11 wounded. This is an indication of the slightly reduced tempo of IRA operations brought about by extensive patrolling, made possible by the present force levels, which inhibits the movement of weapons, gunmen and explosives. Following the recent pronouncements by the Provisional IRA about the intensification of their campaign this is a welcome development. It may also be that recent adverse publicity has aggravated existing disagreements within the movement over present policy. 
2. Official IRA. They have threatened through the media to take "defensive 
action" against the UDA in Co TYRONE for alleged attacks on civilians. They would not consider this to be a breach of their truce. 
Security Force Activity 3. 
The Security Forces have continued to make inroads on the Provisional IRA 
and a number of Provisional officers have been arrested including engineering officer of 1 Bn who is believed to be responsible for a number of sophisticated devices which have been used recently in Andersonstown. Four Provisionals were arrested by the RUC in Londonderry on 1 September in the act of robbing a Savings Bank. Over 20 Provisional Officers have now been charged since the beginning of Operation MOTORMAN and 9 have been detained. 
4. The planned move out of the schools in Londonderry and West Belfast has been 
completed. Troops remain in part of St Genevieves, Oliver Plunkett and St Peters Schools and at the beginning of the Auntumn Term on Monday 4 September school attendance was minimal. These schools will continue to be a source of propaganda for the Provisionals until alternative accommodation is obtained. Work has started on a new camp to replace the accommodation currently provided by St Genevieves School,and should be available by mid October. 
5. Security Force casualties for August totalled 20 killed (including 3 UDR) 
and 77 wounded (including 7 UDR and 4 RUC). These figures are amongst the highest for any comparable period since the beginning of this campaign. 
6. Following reports of UDA patrols in the MAGHERA/DESERTMARTIN area Security 
Force patrols were increased and only one UDA road block was reported. This dispersed when ordered to do so by an Army patrol. A patrol of 1 PARA arrested a man armed with a pistol who was later identified as 
(self styled 
Lt Col in the UDA). This arrest was followed by attempts by ANDERSON of the UDA to negotiate his immediate release. DOYLE has appeared in court and has been remanded in custody until 8 September. Following the discovery of a hand grenade in a car in Lisburn three Protestans were arrested, one of whom has been charged and remanded in custody. These arrests have led to the UDA accusing the Security Forces of harassment.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 010700 TO 040700 SEPTEMBER 72 1. 
GENERAL. The level of violence was low on Fri/Sat (18 shootings 4 
explosions) and Sun/Mon (16 shootings 2 explosions) but higher than usual on Sat/Sun (55 shootings 38 in Belfast nil explosions). In all one soldier was killed (accidentally); three soldiers and one RUC constable were wounded; and six civilains were hurt. In Belfast at 0410 hrs on Sunday morning two patrols met in 40 Cdo area (NEW LODGE) and engaged one another accidentally. Gnr CUTTING (7 Bty RA att 40 Cdo) was killed and one gunner and one marine were wounded. On Sunday afternnon in Andersonstown both Catholic civil rights movements supported by a number of parents and teachers, in all about 400, demonstrated against continued use by Security Forces of Catholic schools. (Term begins again today 4 Sep). Londonderry was quiet, as was the border. In the countryside, there were a few assorted incidents, mostly in Portadown. In Great Britain, weekend press comment featured the disclosures of the Provisional defector 
, whose position in law is unclear - she 
is reportedly wanted by Interpol in connection with the attempt to fly Czech arms through Amsterdam on 16 Oct 1971. The main points she made were that there is a power struggle within the Provisional leadership, who are under pressure to call off the bombing compaign; that a real power resides in the hands of Stephenson ( a bigoted murderer) in Dublin, and Toomey in Belfast, where the dynamic for the whole campaign exists; that anger among Northern Catholics in general has been growing because of the political sterility of a purely terrorist policy; and that the IRA must call a cease fire and talk, while HMG must realise that the IRA must have a place at some ultimate conference table. In the Republic, the Provisionals issued a statement dismissing the allegations made in England by Maria McGuire, claiming that she was of no consequence in the organisation and knew little of significance. 
Elsewhere, Mr Heath meets Mr Lynch today 4 Sep in Munich at the Olympic Games. 2. During FRI/SAT 1/2 SEP 72 the Province was quiet. There were 17 shooting 
incidents of which 14 involved the Security Forces. A Corporal in 40 Cdo was wounded in the leg by gunfire. There was one explosion, and ATO detonated 3 devices. There was a spate of arson in Portadown, thought to be an attempt by Protestants to set up an intersectarian clash. 
3. During SAT/SUN 2/3 SEP 72 there was a marked increase in shooting and in 
Belfast the level was the highest since Motorman. However there were no explosions, although there was a spate of incendiary attacks against Protestant owned shops in Ballymena In an incident in Belfast 2 patrols mistook each other for gunmen and exchanged fire; one soldier was killed and two wounded. Elsewhere two soldiers, and an RUC constable were wounded one of whom was on leave. Four civilians wore wounded and 4 hits were claimed. 
4. During SUN/MON 3/4 SEP 72 there were fewer incidents than the day before. 
There were 16 shooting incidents of which Security Forces were involved in 12. There were two explosions. There were no Security Force casualties or hits claimed, but two civilians were wounded in Belfast. There was a demonstration in Andersonstown against the use of schools by Security Forces. In Co Londonderry UDR fired over the heads of an angry crowd at a VCP; Bernadette Devlin rang HQ Northern Ireland

NIOM(72)34 Note of a meeting at noon on 25 August 
OPERATIONS There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate 
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces. Since Operation Motorman fourteen members of the security forces have been killed and fifty-six wounded. ARREST AND INTERROGATION POLICIES 2. 
The meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against 
the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given rise to press enquiries. Possible changes in the law or legal procedure are being considered by an inter-departmental group. In considering in due course whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving their. objectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since Operation Motorman and what has happened to them. It will then be possible to form a view as to the reasons why the hard-core of the Provisionals appears not yet to have been brought into custody. The Ministry of Defence will try to prepare this analysis and make it available to the GOC, with whom there will probably be discussions in Northern Ireland next week. INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
Questions about the Government’s plans for dealing with the level of 
military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the news, and are difficult to handle. There would be great dangers, however, in trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced to reduce their campaign against civilians. LEGAL MATTERS 4. 
It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought 
of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers Act. When there is evidence, arrests can therefore be made with a view to charges being brought. The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office will ensure that this is understood by the Army and the RUC respectively. NEXT MEETING 5. 
There will be no meeting on Tuesday, 29 August. The meeting at noon on Friday, 1 September, will be in Conference Room ’B’.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 18 August 1972 
UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 18 AUGUST 1972 
INTRODUCTION 
1. General. The military posture remains unchanged and selective searches continued to produce small finds and arrests of wanted men including two officer of 3 Bn Provisional IRA. The significant events of the last 48 hours have been the continued reduction of shooting incidents at SF in Belfast to a level of around 6 per day. Elsewhere in the Province there were only 3 shooting at SF throughout the entire period. However the SF have suffered relatively severe casualties totalling 1 killed and 5 wounded. The renewed spate of large bombings resulted in a predictably vocal reaction from the UDA. The manifestations of this reaction were not as noticeable as the news media have suggested and no UDA patrols were seen by SF patrols. All Official IRA men have now been released from internment and they are making a concerted effort to obtain the support of the general public within their areas of influence. 
BELFAST 
2. The Security Forces sustained 1 fatal casualty and 4 other casualties in 2 bombings and 1 shooting incident. 
3. There were no shooting incidents at the Security Forces in Andersonstown but widespread juvenile hooliganism continued and troops being stoned were forced to fire baton rounds on a number of occasions. A blast bomber lost his hand in a premature explosion. 
4. A remotely detonated bomb in a shop severely injured two soldiers of a passing foot patrol in Cupar St. 
5. The major incident of the period was the explosion which demolished the Standard Bar in Agnes Street. This caused two SF casualties and a civilian casualty, and, despite a warning, some 50 people were treated in hospital for shock. This large figure resulted from the reluctance of onlookers to leave the areas as ordered by the SF. A second bomb demolished the forecourt of a new filling station on the Antrim Road. These two incidents resulted in a declaration by the UDA that they would mobilise 3,000 men to assist the Security Forces in the prevention of bombings and assassinations. The news media seized on this development and newspaper reports of UDA patrols out in force on the streets were not borne out by fact.

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE - CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO 
COS 34TH MEETING/72 HELD ON TUESDAY 28 NOVEMBER 1972 AT 2.45 pm 
ITEM 2. 1. SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND SIR PETER HILL-NORTON invited the Chief of the General 
Staff to bring them up to date on the situation in Northern Ireland. 
2. SIR MICHAEL CARVER then outlined the course of events 
since the beginning of Operation MOTORMAN on 31 July. This Operation could be regarded as being completed by the end of November but there would be no let up in the Army’s arrest policy and intelligence effort. There was however a need to redefine the role of the Army and he hoped that the new directive he had prepared for the GOC would be cleared by Ministers before 1 December. He went on to describe the general situation and the political hurdles to be overcome during the coming year. On the security front there were grounds for cautious optimism and he thought that a total of 18 units in the infantry role, temporarily reinforced during periods of increased tension, would be the minimum force level likely to be needed. To reduce overstretch of BAOR units, the Secretary of State had agreed to authorise the use of the two Irish cavalry regiments in the infantry role in UNFICYP for one six-month tour each from November 1973. In addition it was hoped to include the three Medium Regiments RA in BAOR, one at a time, in the roulement plot for Northern Ireland duties starting in October 1973. He expressed his appreciation for the continuing assistance being given to the Army by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. 
3. SIR PETER HILL-NORTON said that they were grateful to 
the Chief of the General Staff for his statement. They would take note of his decision to employ the Irish Regiments in UNFICYP and SACEUR would have to be informed of this in due course. However the timing of notification to SACEUR of the

arrests made in the period 19th February-5th March and also a break-down of detention figures. You will notice that under the 
procedure a very much larger percentage of people have been detained than under the former detention orders. We have had a 
particularly good week this week in charging various people for murders. Indeed there were no less than six such charges yesterday including the case of the two postmen. 
We have managed to squeeze some money, during the last week, from the Ministry of Home Affairs to hire uses for schools in the Crumlin Road. This particular scheme started this morning and so long as it works reasonably well will mean the end of the lollipop patrol which was in fact removed today. I have not publicised this fact since this might lead to a disruption of the scheme. 
My best regards. 
When you were last here you asked a question about the conviction of criminals. I am attaching as an appendix a few notes on

violence had demonstrably started. There are a number of reasons, as follows: 
a. Hard intelligence, sufficient under current rules to lead 
to the signing of ICOs or to criminal charges, exists on only about 25 prominent Protestant terrorists. Arrests, followed by release for insufficient evidence, would be counter-productive and provocative. 
b. Large scale searches of houses would, for similar reasons, 
prove more provocative than productive. c. 
SSNI is now committed to the release of some detainees 
from the Maze and to an increase in those paroled before Christmas. Since the majority of those released and paroled are likely to be RCs (if only because there are fewer Protestant detainees), invidious comparisons could be drawn between the release of IRA men on the one hand and the arrest of Loyalists on the other. 
d. HMG and the SF have consistently maintained a public 
attitude in which the IRA is considered the primary target and Protestant terrorism has tended to be minimised. An extensive pre-emptive campaign before violence began in earnest could be difficult if not impossible to justify. 
e. It is possible at this stage to say that current force 
levels (due to reduce to 16 major units by 1 December) would not permit an extensive operation in Protestant areas without either significant redeployment from RC areas or some reinforcement by MOD. This aspect is considered more fully at paragraphs 12 to 
8. 
For all these reasons, therefore, it is considered that SF action before violence breaks out should seek to:

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
a. Deter extremists and their supporters from a campaign of 
violence by (1) 
Selective arrests of those against whom criminal 
charges could be brought or 100 signed, at the most opportune moment. 
(2) Selective searches for arms and ammunition based on 
good intelligence. (3) 
b. Very close protection of political leaders. Maintain the pressure on the PIRA, in order to reduce 
still further the credibility of Protestant fears. c. 
Bolster the confidence of the RC population that HMG and 
the SF can and would provide its only effective protection; to this end, the SF presence in RC areas and cover of sensitive RC targets should be maintained. 
d. Limit the movement of terrorists, arms and explosives, as 
soon as clear intelligence of impending violence is available, by imposing Op LINGO on the River Bann. 
COUNTER MEASURES 9. 
Once Protestant extremists begin a campaign of violence, the 
options for SF counter action are wider. At that moment, the professions of Loyalist leaders that they would seek the downfall of the Executive and Assembly by legitimate democratic processes would be open to IP attack; by the same token, SF operations Would be justifiable as impartial and designed to preserve law and order. One important constraint would remain, however; it would still be

(2) The world in general is experiencing a period of increasing terrorism when subversives throughout the Western and uncommitted countries 
prepared to exploit 
traditional antagonisms. At the least, therefore training and propaganda support is likely to be available to the IRA from outside sources, to help them restart and then maintain violence as a political weapon whenever the situation is favourable. 
(3) It is clear that tension, occasionally erupting as incidents, is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. 
b. RC Community. No matter how marked or general may be the RC 
community’s rejection of IRA violence, there is likely to remain an element within that community which is implacably and historically opposed to the British connection and accustomed to violence as a means of demonstrating its conviction. This element could numerically be strengthened if former detainees wore released under the Emergency Provisions Bill review procedure. There is little prospect of change in the IRA’s long term aim to reunify Ireland by any means including force, except when a ceasefire appears at the time to be more expedient. Should the Republicans’ voice in the new Assembly prove to be muted or non-existent, there is a distinct danger that the IRA may consider starting up a new phase of increased violence as its only recourse. c. 
Protestant Community. Protestant opinion is divided on the proposals 
of the White Paper as they now stand, but much will depend on the way the political situation develops in the month ahead. A substantial proportion of the community seems to be in favour of giving the White raper a chance to work. Of the proportion which opposes it, there is an element which is prepared to use violence, whose members have equipped themselves with weapons and have demonstrated a capability in the recent past for terrorism and for inciting violence as a means of exerting pressure. It is this element which can be expected, in response to IRA terrorism or any fears of a "sell out" to present a threat to law and order in the foreseeable future. d. 
Scenario. Although a return to some sort of normality is assumed, it 
is clear that there will continue to be a threat to law and order for some years to come. The level of lawlessness is likely to show periodic peaks of intensity. It is possible that a period of similar intensity to the

GENERAL 1. 
a. The climate for the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections(MTAB) 
is likely to be similar to that of the Local Government Elections Which took place on 30 May 1973. However, because of the greater significance of the NIAE, the level of tension will inevitably be higher, with a correspondingly greater risk of any particular incident or terrorist act 
leading to an increased use of violence. b. 
No significant direct threat to the NIAE is foreseen, though 
attempts at intimidation can be expected. Whilst elements of the official IRA (OIRA) will be involved in campaigning for Republican Club candidates, the Provisional IRA (PIRA) is likely to try to attack soft and possibly eye catching targets at election time. Extreme Protestant groups may be expected to continue to perpetrate isolated outrages. 
c. In spite of the threat posed by extremist groups the outlook for 
the poll itself is bright. With virtually all political organisations now encouraging their supporters to use their voting papers rather than abstain, a high poll can be expected, possibly in the region of 80% of the electorate, inclusive of postal votes. 
OFFICIAL IRA/SINN FEIN 2. 
There are 10 Republican Club (and one Republican Labour) candidates for the 
NIAE and the more politically-minded of the OIRA will certainly be heavily involved campaigning on their behalf. Disillusionment with the Republican Club candidates in the LGE may lead some of the wilder elements among the OIRA, who are already discontented at their relative lack of action, into acts of local violence. One report has suggested that there might be some deliberate OIRA terrorist acts before the NIAE, but it is thought unlikely that there will be any fundamental change in OIRA tactics. Barring any general upsurge in violence, the OIRA leadership will probably stick to its "retaliation only" policy. 
PROVISIONAL IRA/SINN FEIN 3. 
The PIRA have only a negative interest in the NIAE. The comparative failure 
of the policy of intimidation, and the exposure of attempts by OIRA/Sinn Fein voters to gain votes by personating abstaining Provisional voters at the LGE, has led the Provisionals to advise their supporters to spoil their ballot papers rather than not participate. Given the present dominance of the PIR by Twomey and other Northern hard-liners, the present policy of violence seems bound to continue. Reports indicate that there may be attempts to escalate activity during the pre-election period. There is nothing to indicate that the PIRA will try to attack targets specifically connected with the elections. However, it would be consistent for them to attempt to draw attention away from politics by violent means, and possibly to attempt some form of spectacular attack to obtain maximum publicity. It is also possible, especially in Londonderry, that any planned series of anti-internment marches and demonstrations may be used to provoke incidents with SF.

LEGAL POSITION OF SOLDIERS AT POLLING STATIONS, AT POLICY AND 
ACTION AGAINST PICKETING AND INTIMIDATION Action in polling Stations 1. 
Enter a polling station. b. 
The law for the NIAE provides that soldiers may: a. 
Remove from a polling station, by order of the presiding 
officer, a person who misconducts himself in the polling station or fails to obey the lawful orders of the presiding officer. 
2. 3. Soldiers are to enter a polling station only if the police are 
unable to carry out, or unable to carry out unaided, their duties at the polling station. 
The maintenance of order in a polling station is primarily the 
responsibility of the presiding officer, supported by the RUC. 4. 
they may: a. 
Where soldiers enter a polling station in support of the RUC, Arrest a person committing a breach of the peace or another 
serious offence to which soldiers’ normal powers of arresting persons red-handed apply. Where possible however such arrests should be made by the RUC. 
b. Remove from the polling station a person other than an 
offender under 4a above, who misconducts himself or who fails to obey the lawful order of the presiding officer, but only if the presiding officer orders it. 
5. 6. On no account are soldiers to take photographs in polling stations. If, in exceptional circumstances, soldiers make arrests as in 
paragraph 4a. the arrested person is to be handed over to the police as soon as possible via an RMP arrest team. 
Arrest Policy 7. 
Reference D applies, except that planned arrest operations are to be 
conducted only as specific and local responses in the event of terrorist outrages. Otherwise persons falling into the categories specified in paragraph 7 of reference D are to be arrested only if they are seen at large. If such persons are seen in the vicinity of polling stations they are, if circumstances permit, to be arrested after leaving the polling station rather than before casting their vote.

ANNEX G TO 1021 G OP INSTR 3/73 
DATED 15 JUNE 1973 PICKETING AT POLLING STATIONS 
1. Picketing, although not forecast to be widespread, could be a 
serious problem which might cause a presiding officer to close his polling station. It could take the following forms: 
a. b. 
Obstruction of persons entering station. Verbal persuasion against voters by a line of 
pickets. c. 
2. 3. Pickets noting details of voters with a view to probably retributive action later. The proper response to picketing is firstly a matter for the RUC 
who should try to dissuade the pickets, move them on or, if necessary, arrest them. 
If the RUC find themselves unable to take sufficient action and 
seek Army assistance, troops should take the following action: a. 
Warn the pickets to disperse. b. c. If they refuse to disperse, move them on physically. Arrest those causing a breach of the peace, using the 
common law power of arresting persons committing a breach of the peace. Millboards should be confiscated and handed to the RMP arrest team together with those arrested. 
d. Where a breach of the peace is not committed, but the 
conduct of the pickets is intimidatory, they should be arrested only if there is no other way to get them to desist. In these circumstances the power of arrest to be used is SPA Regulation 11, in accordance with the Blue Card. The words to be used are: "I suspect you of being about to commit (or of committing) acts prejudicial to the peace". 
e. Soldiers are not to photograph pickets or voters. 
f. Comds are to be given discretion not to take action against pickets if this is likely to provoke reaction out of proportion to the offence.

staff are still so stretched. 6. 
The opening of Magilligan Camp has been put back by one week in 
order to allow more time for the build up of staff reinforcements fr Britain. The postponement has been made possible by a slight drop it the rate of new internment orders (though there is of course considerable overcrowding already in Crumlin Road and, to a lesser extent, in Long Kesh). Rumoured plans to intern women 7. 
It has now been established that the RUC have about five women 
listed as wanted persons, but that the Northern Ireland authorities are alive to the political difficulties of interning them, and are not therefore planning to order their arrest. It is thought that the Ambassador in Dublin could be instructed to inform Mr. Lynch that no internment of women is in prospect. On the other hand, a public statement to that effect might be counteer-productive, in that it would focus fresh attention on the rumours and would stimulate supplementary questions.

Following the suggestion made by the Ambassador in Dublin (in his telegram no. 5 of 7 January), a check is being made on whether the Northern Ireland authorities do in fact have any plans for detaining or interning women: so that, if there are no such plans, the rumours which have been circulating that women are about to be interned 
- and, in particular, that Magilligan Camp is being re-opened for this purpose - can be scotched (though care will have to be taken not to seal off this option completely).

Political Issues: Inter-Party Talks The immediate question concerns the nature of the replies to the 
letters which the Home Secretary has received from Mr. Callaghan and Sir Harry Nicholas about the scope of the proposed talks. Mr. Callaghan’s letter simply asks for confirmation that they would be "open-ended", while ir harry Nicholas says more explicitly that internment is an impediment to 
the success of any political initiative. The Government’s reply should presumably confirm that any talks would be "open-ended" in the sense of being without prejudice and without commitment on the part of any of the participants. But should it not add that this means, so far as the Government are concerned, that there can be no question of ending internment unilaterally, i.e. so long as violence persists ? 2. 
If so, however, the prospects for the talks are not bright. 
Dr. Paisley has indicated that he will not take part if unification is on the agenda; and, despite some recent haverings by Mr. Fitt, it seems fairly clear that the SDLP will not participate if the Government say that they are not prepared to end internment. 
This is not necessarily 
an unsatisfactory position for the Government, at least in the short term, since public opinion is not likely to agree that the Government should let loose a lot of gunmen and terrorists in return for no more than a promise merely to take part in inter-Party talks without any assurance that they will have a successful outcome. And, provided that internment itself is properly managed (and this is for discussion under a later item on the agenda) and that the Army seem to be continuing to gain the upper hand over the IRA, the Government can probably afford to rest in this position at least for the time being. 3. 
But it is not a long-term policy; and sooner or later the Government 
will he driven to try to devise some new political initiative which offers better prospects of success than inter-Party talks as at present envisaged. Here we confront the old dilemma 
- should any new initiative be based on the 
fundamental premises that the Border remains intact and that the Stormont system continues; or should it envisage some basic modification in these assumptions? Hitherto, Ministers have judged that it would not be possible to modify ither of them without risking the fall of Mr. Faulkner’s Government and the inevitable need, as a result, to introduce direct rule.

7 January 1972 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 31 DECEMBER 1971 - 6 JANUARY 1972 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL 1. 
involving marches from rallying points which were in defiance of the ban on processions. This may well provoke reaction from Paisleyite elements who have been active in marches in the past. A soldier was killed by sniper fire in Belfast on 5 January. In the Republic, some of the United Nations forces in Cyprus have been recalled and a contingent of them has arrived home. 
SPEECH BY THE NORTHERN IRELAND MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE 
2. Mr Harry West, the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, in a speech to a Unionist meeting in Co. Antrim, said that the border with the Republic should be sealed off completely by troops, with access to Northern Ireland allowed only on production of personal identification or a valid passport. The principle of a civilianised and unarmed police force could perhaps have had the effect of destroying the spirit, effectiveness and capability of the RUC. These must be restored. He also is reported as saying that there was a lack of real determination by the British Government to bring the IRA campaign to a speedy and successful end and seems to have cast doubts whether the security undertakings given in the Downing Street Declaration had been fulfilled. 
LEGISLATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND TO PROVIDE FOR A DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
3. The Prosecution of Offences Bill, published at Stormont, is 
intended to make new provision for the prosecution of offences in Northern Ireland. In particular, it provides for the appointment by the Governor of a Director and Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions and, by the Ministry of Home Affairs, of professional staff to assist the Director, with area offices where the Director may consider it necessary. It would be the duty of the Director to consider what prosecutions should be brought for all but minor offences. Certain functions would be shared between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General, but the Director would be responsible for the due performance of his functions to the Attorney-General, who would accordingly be answerable in Parliament for the performance of the functions of the Director and his department.

issued last November. This is a restricted document but copies of the Fellow card had come into the hands of journalists. Amongst the alleged changes in the rules, it was not now mandatory for a soldier to give a warning before opening fire, although a warning should be given. Automatic weapons could now be used and troops could carry loaded rifles ready for immediate fire. A soldier could now fire at a car, it was said if he thought that its occupants had opened fire or thrown a bomb or were clearly about to do so. 
BBC’S ENQUIRY INTO THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND 5. 
The BBC went ahead with their programme on Wednesday 5 January in an atmosphere of public controversy. The Home Secretary had 
previously written to the Chairman of the Governors of the BBC saying that the program, in the form in which it had been devised, could do no good and night do serious harm; and Mr Faulkner also made public his view that no Stormont Minister should take part. Those appearing in the programme included Mr Harold Wilson MP (in a pre-recording), Mr Ian Paisley MP, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Mr Robert Cooper, (co-chairman of the Alliance Party) Mr Neil Blaney, Mr David Bleakley, Miss Bernadette Devlin MP, Mr Michael O’Kennedy and Mr John Maginnis MP. The "tribunal" conducting the programme were Lord Devlin (chairman), Lord Caradon and Sir John Foster QC MP. 
WITHDRAWAL OF UK TROOPS IN CYPRUS BY THE REPUBLIC 
6. It was announced on 3 January that the Government of the Republic had decided to begin the process of reducing the strength of the contingent of the Republic’s troops in the UN force in Cyprus by 250 of the 391 men. About 160 returned home on 5 January and a further 92 are expected to do so an 19 January. The decision to reduce the strength of the contingent was taken in order to "make more troops available for service at hme, thus reducing the heavy burden of duty falling on the existing personnel". The 140 men left on duty in Cyprus would remain there "as long as the U requires them, or the situation at home permits". 
MEASURES IN THE REPUBLIC 7. AGAINST THE IRA It seems that the Government of the Republic may be considering 
what measures would need to be taken should violence and intimidation in rease in the Republic. Mr O’Malley, the minister for Justice, said on 4 January that he did not think it was necessary to create more severe penalties for illegal possession of firearms. However, recent incidents such as the disturbances at Ballyshannon and the firing of shots at the funeral at the weekend f Jack McCabe, when a paramilitary uniformed escort was provided, may be causing the Government alarm, and have led to speculation that legislation against the wearing of certain types of uniform might be under consideration. here has been some speculation whether the Government of the Republic 
may be obliged to contemplate the reintroduction of internment. It has also been reported that the establishment of some form of military courts may become necessary if intimidation of juries and of the judiciary were to increase. Prosecutions 
riotous assembly, malicious damage and alleged incitement to violence are pending against a number of people involved in the recent disturbances at Ballyshannon.

SECURITY SITUATION 8. A soldier was killed in Belfast on 5 January when a single shot 
was fired at an Army patrol in the Divis Flats area. There were other shooting attacks in Belfast and Londonderry, especially towards the end of the week. Street disturbances, involving stoning of troops, occurred in Londonderry on 3 and 4 January. Border incidents occurred near Forkill on 1 January and near Newry on 5 January. Incidents of shooting, explosions and nail bomb attacks occurred in Dungannon on 2 January and there have been street disturbances in Lurgan and shooting incidents and bomb attacks in Newry. 
9. A bomb explosion on a hi-jacked lorry in the centre of Belfast 
on 3 January injured 52 people, many of them being hit by fragments of broken glass bottles, but only 5 people were detained in hospital. Successful arms searches revealed pistols and 1800 rounds in North Belfast and an important find of weapons in the Falls Road area. Over £13,000 has been stolen in armed robberies, the main attacks being on post offices and banks. 
10. Marches in connection with the NICRA Anti-Internment rally took place without serious incident in defiance of the ban on processions. Some 2,500 people attended the rally at the Falls Park; they dispersed peacefully at the end of the meeting. Mr Paddy Devlin, Mr Austin Currie, Mr Ivan Cooper and Miss Bernadette Devlin took part at some stage in the proceedings. 
11. The Army made raids on two clubs, in the centre of Belfast and in the Ardoyne area, on 3 January. In the first raid, barricades were erected when the Army arrived to screen the people inside. Hand to hand fighting occurred between the troops and about 70 men, and rubber bullets were fired to gain entry to the club. In the other raid, in the Ardoyne, 4 men suspected of being important members of the Provisional IRA were arrested.

Northern Ireland The Official Committee on Northern Ireland met this morning to 
prepare for the next Ministerial discussion, which should not be later, I think, than the early part of next week. The most important of the outstanding issues is the present situation as regards the proposed interParty talks. Since the Home Secretary saw Mr. Callaghan before Christmas he has received two letters on the subject. The first was from Mr. Callaghan himself on 30 December and asks the Home Secretary, in effect, to confirm Mr. Callaghan’s understanding that there would be no barrier to the discussion of any relevant topic which any one of the Parties represented might wish to raise. The Home Secretary considers that he has already covered this point by making public his New Year message to Mr. Faulkner, in which he confirmed that the agenda for the discussions would be open. The other letter is from Sir Harry Nicholas, informing the Home Secretary of a resolution of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party passed on 22 December to the effect that the NEC condemned the policy of internment and the methods of interrogation revealed by the Compton Report; urged the Government to confirm that the inter-Party talks proposed would be open-ended and to convene them immediately thereafter; and recorded the view that "the continuation of internment of British subjects without charge or trial is an impediment to the success of any political initiative". The resolution therefore endorses, by implication, the SDLP line that internment must end before they can take part in talks. I understand that the Home Secretary proposes to consult his colleagues before replying to either of these communications. This certainly needs to be done before Parliament resumes at the latest; and the question of the Government’s attitude towards inter-Party talks might, I suggest, be the principal item for a meeting next week, unless you want to take the opportunity to raise it after the DOP meeting tomorrow, when the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary will be available. 2. 
Other topics mentioned at the meeting this morning were:(a) The security situation. It was reported that the IRA are showing 
signs of suffering from attrition; and that the future policy of the Provisionals may be to concentrate on fewer, but larger, explosive attacks, while the Officials are more likely to concentrate

that those ring leaders will subsequently be prosecuted. A check is therefore being made to ensure that the RUC do in fact intend t Prosecutions in respect of the two recent anti-internment marches 
8. Technically the Complete ban on marches which was imposed 
and is therefore due to lapse at the end of January, if not renewed. For both political and military reasons it seems essential 
concurrently with the introduction of internment was only for six months 
that the ban should in fact-be continued and the GOC is accordingly for it to be renewed. 
The BBC and Northern Ireland 9. It seems that the BBC had got themselves into the position where 
whatever official discouragement they encountered, they felt too far committed to their debate programme on Northern Ireland to be able to drop it. This is perhaps because their top management gave premature approval for the programme, without first satisfying themselves that it was sensibly conceived 
- and thus, without realising that much of 
the punning for it was inept. It does not seem likely to be a very successful production. 10. Mr. Michael Charlton has tentatively proposed that "Panorama" should make a programme - 
mainly in Northern Ireland - on the subject 
of urban guerrilla warfare. He envisages that the programme would include interviews with the GOC and perhaps other Army commanders in the Province. (He mentioned interviewing Brigadier Kitson, but it would probably not be in that officer’s own interest to be given further prominence as a counter-insurgency expert while he is still serving in northern Ireland.) Charlton also envisages including interview 
- which he guarantees would be hostile - with a 1eading 
meber of the IRA, south of the border. 11. This programe holds promise of being helpful in bringing out the squalor and criminality of the IRA; and there may be advantage in seen to be willing to co-operate with the BBC when they are trying to make a responsible programme. "Panorama" 
do not expect the programme

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 46 
Incidents in the last 72 hours The weekend was relatively quiet. On Sunday, the NIORA Anti- 
Internment Rally passed off without incident, and was successfully prevented from forming a marching column for any distance at a time. It seems certain, nevertheless, that it will be seen by the Protestant community as an illegal march which the authorities failed to prevent, and it may accordingly frm an awkward precedent when the main season for the traditional marches comes along. 2. 
and searched for wanted men; after 70 people had been screened, four were found to be wanted - 
including two company commanders of the 
Provisional IRA in Belfast. A similar operation in the north of Belfast on Sunday night met with resistance, and some damage to property, before the screening could be carried out: two men were finally arrested. 3. 
On Saturday night a club in the Ardoyne was successfully cordoned r Shooting incidents recurred throughout the weekend, the majority 
being in Belfast. On Friday there were six in the city, in one of which a former British soldier was attacked by masked men in his home; on Saturday there were eight, in one of which a gunman was seen to be hit when a patrol opened fire in the Ardoyne; and on Sunday there were four, in one of which two soldiers of 1 KOSB were slightly wounded by gunfire from a passing ar in Springfield Road. 4. 
Outside Belfast, shots were fired at two RUC stations on Friday, 
at Belleek (where the shots came from across the border) and at Coalisland. On Saturday a mobile patrol came under fire from across

substantiated. Internee accommodation and staffing 10. Of the British prison warders who have volunteered for service in Northern Ireland, the first dozen or so will be sent across during this week - with, it is hoped, larger contingents following during the next two or three weeks. The Home Office may ask MOD for help in transporting the larger groups by air, if this seems desirable. Unfortunately, the retired governor mentioned in previous reports has withdrawn his offer to come out of retirement 
- apparently under 
pressure from relatives and friends that he would be courting danger to life and property if he went ahead with his offer. 11. The Prisons Department of the Home Office have indicated that they do not wish to object to the new camp for internees at Long Kesh being built to the same standard as the present camp 
- i.e. to 
consist of hutted accommodation. In view of the urgency of getting on with the new camp, MOD have areed to provide some huts from Army stocks for the civilian contractor to use for the first phase of the camp, but have made it clear to the Northern Ireland Government that later requirements for huts must be met from commerical sources. The Northern Ireland authorities apparently remain confident of their ability to find a contractor for this job; but there is room for doubt about whether this will prove possible. Overt IRA activity in the Republic 12. The present rash of acts of defiance by the IRA within Eire such as the recent demonstration at Ballyshannon against the prosecution of three men for the possession of arms, and the ceremonial funeral during the weekend of Jack McCabe (see Report no. 45) - is thought likely to prove helpful to the extent that it brings press to bear on Mr. Lynch to do something to curb the IRA; provided of course that it does not develop to the point of fatally undermining his Government’s ability to survive.

The organisers are apparently laying stress on the rally rather than the march, in the hope of circumventing the ban on processions; the fact remains that the converging groups, whether their movement amounts formally to marching or not, are likely in an urban setting to spark off clashes with Protestant communities cloe to whom they pass. In this respect this rally is potentially much more likely to result in serious trouble than was the march at Christmas on an open motorway. 8. 
this afternoon to consider how to handle this demonstration. Attacks on homes of prominent citizens 9. 
The Army and Police authorities in Northern Ireland are meeting The Official wing of the IRA appear to be claiming responsibility 
for the destruction of the homes of prominent citizens in Northern Ireland, such as the attack on the home of Major Neill on 29 December; and the claim that they are acting in reprisal for alleged damage by the security forces to the homes of "workers" seems consistent with the philosophy of the Officials rather than the Provisionals. Staff for internment and detention 10. First indications are that the Home Office trawl for volunteers from the British Prisons Service has met with an encouraging response A former prison governor, who is himself a Catholic, has agreed to come out of retirement to run one of the internment camps; a very helpful development (which was foreshadowed in Report No 38). Parker Committee 11.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 43 29 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents during the period 23 - 28 December The period of the Christmas holiday passed quite quietly, with 
comparatively few minor incidents and no really major ones. (A dayby-day summary of the incidents which did occur is attached at Annex.) Throughout the period there were 16 explosions 
- as well as a number 
of bomb hoaxes - and 44 outbreaks of shooting. There were gunshot wounds, fortunately all slight, to a soldier of 1 Glosters in Belfast on 27 December and to two RUC constables in Strabane on 28 December; and one terrorist is believed to have been hit. One soldier and one civilian were fatally injured in accidents involving Service vehicles. Altogether 61 wanted persons were arrested during the period, none of them of outstanding importance but including two IRA quartermasters. 2. 
Yesterday was the least peaceful day in the period, with some 
minor rioting of the usual kind in Londonderrry in reaction to a successful search operation in the Boside. 3. 
A bomb which had failed to explode has been found on the 
premises of the Grand Orange Lodge in Glasgow. Staff for internment and detention 
4. It is hoped that the first results of the Home Office’s trawl 
for volunteers from the British Prisons Service to serve in Northern Ireland will be known within two or three days. There is not then expected to be much delay in sending over the volunteers as they become available. The need thus to reinforce the warder staff in Northern Ireland, and to stiffen it with some extra experience, remains very urgent if the capacity for accommodating internees and detainees is not to fall too far behind the rate of arrests and internments implicit in the present concept of operations. So far it has not been necessary to halt arrests, but they are having to be

FOLLOWING FOR ARMSTRONG FROM GREGSON YESTERDAY’S TALKS BETWEEN THE LABOUR PARTY, THE IRISH LABOR 
PARTY, THE NILP AND THE SDLP ARE NOT GIVEN MUCH PROMINENCE IN TODAY’S NEWSPAPERS. NO PAPER IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT, IF ANYTHING, WAS AGREED. THE TIMES HEADLINE IS : 
" STALEMATE IN LABOUR 
MEETING ON PROVINCE’’ AND THE GUARDIAN SAYS: ’’ ALL THE SIGNS ARE THAT THE MEETING REACHED VIRTUAL DEADLOCK ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE SDLP WOULD TAKE PART IN THE ALL PARTY TALKS’’. AFTER THE MEETING FITT SAID: ’’WE HAVE RESERVED OUR POSITION ON THE QUESTION OF INTERNMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT BEFORE ANY MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS TAKE PLACE THE SYSTEM OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL MUST BE ENDED’’. 
2. WAS AS FOLLOWS : 
HOWEVER THE BRITISH LABOUR PARTY’S STATEMENT AFTER THE MEETING ’’ AS A RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION THE BRITISH LABOUR 
PARTY INTENDS TO SEEK A FORMAL ASSURANCE FROM HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ARE IN FAVOUR OF INTER-PARTY TALKS AND WERE SUCH TALKS ARRANGED THE AGENDA WOULD BE ENTIRELY OPEN-ENDED, AN IN PARTICULAR WOULD PERMIT EACH OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO PLACE ANY ITEMS ON THE AGENDA, FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY, AND THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT FROM STORMONT TO WESTMINSTER". CALLAGHAN LAID PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE LAST POINT IN A BRIEF INTERVIEW ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT. 
3. THERE IS LITTLE PRESSURE FOR A REACTION FROM THE GOVERMENT. 
OUR LINE IS THAT WE ARE SORRY THAT THE SDLP ARE STILL UNWILLING TO TAKE PART IN TALKS, AND THAT MR. CALLAGHAD WILL NO DOUBT BE IN TOUCH AGAIN WITH THE HOME SECRETARY.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 38 17 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was comparatively quiet, with only minor incidents. 
A mobile patrol came under automtic fire at Armagh and sustained three slight casualties. Shots were also fired at patrols in the Forkill area on three occasions, In Belfast, a policeman was slightly wounded by gunfire; and an Army patrol was fired on but with no casualties. There were also four minor shooting incidents in Londonderry, in which there were no casualties to the security forces but one gunman may have been hit, 2. 
An explosion damaged a transformer near Newry, and there were 
two minor explosions in Belfast. There were also fires at Coalisland, where a refuse lorry was burned, and at Forkill where a house was burned, and a masked man attempted to set fire to an air cylinder store at Lurgan. 3. 
Information given by number two in the IRA in 
Armagh, who was arrested on 14 December - led to four shotguns being found near Portadown. Other searches uncovered three rifles in Whiterock, Belfast, and a claymore mine near Lurgan. 4. 
Arrests of juveniles 5. 
The meeting between the GOC and a delegation of teachers 
yesterday went well, with a constructive discussion; and the teachers agreed to put out a statement afterwards in reasonable terms. Staff for internment 6. 
The trawl for volunteers from the British Prisons Service to 
reinforce the warder staff in Northern Ireland was put out yesterday and there is cautious optimism that something like 150 volnteers 
There were twenty-one arrests of wanted persons during the period

INTER-PARTY TALKS ON NORTHERN IRELAND 1. It might be useful for your meeting with Mr Callaghan tomorrow to have this note on points which have occurred to us in connection with inter-party talks on Northern Ireland. 2. Although "nuts end bolts" questions such as the number of representatives from political parties will be important there are some problems 
about the 
substantive questions in which it would surely be desirable to have preliminary discussions between the two front benches at Westminster, on a Privy Councillor basis, to see what measure of agreement might be For example, if following what the Northern Ireland 
Attorney General suggested at your meeting in Belfast on 14 December it is 
possible to make a radical change in the procedures for internment this is about 
something which it might be helpful to talk about/to the Opposition front bench in confidence. 3. Although the Government would not wish to appear to be holding back on their agreement in principle to talks, the Opposition front bench must recognise: (a) the danger in a number of likely topics of participitating direct rule unintentionally, for example, by driving Mr Faulkner to a position where he has to withdraw or resign, 
(b) the security problems in timing on which the Government are entitled to consult the Army and which the Opposition would surely wish to be informed about, again on a rivy Councillor basis, 
(c) similarly, there may be intelligence of a highly confidential

NOTE FOR THE RECORD Northern Ireland The Leader of the Opposition and Mr. Callaghan came to 
see the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday 15 December at 4.45 p.m. The Leader of the Opposition said that the 
Cabinet had taken up a rather different position from the one which he had suggested in his speech on the arrangements for the proposed inter-party talks. The Shadow Cabinet now thought, and he agreed, that of starting with talks between front and back bench members of the three parties at Westminster, the initial talks should be between the Government and members of the Opposition front bench, and that it would be right to proceed straight from those to inter-party talks between Westminister and Stormont. 
The Opposition now saw no need 
to include Government or pposition backbenchers in the first stage, which would therefore consist of talks betWeen the two front benches at Westminster. r. Wilson and Mr. Callaghan said that they would 
not wish to discuss internment with the Goverment in the initial talks. 
It could queer the pitch later if they 
were thought to have been having private discussions with the Government about interment. 
But this subject was bound 
to be on the agenda for the discussions with the parties at Stormont.

Northern Ireland The agenda on Monday morning can perhaps be conveniently 
divided under the following three headings:A. 
Situation reports, as necessary. We shall need to have the Army’s 
assessment of the renewed outburst of violence in the last few days in the light of the intelligence reports that the IRA (particularly the Brady faction) are becoming increasingly disorganised and disheartened. 
Is the murder 
of the 2 UDR men a precursor of a campaign directed against the UDR or Roman Catholic members of it? If so, are measures being taken? What is the situation over Protestant extremists? Who blew up McGurk’s bar? The latest intelligence reports suggest that the explosion was caused accidently amongst a group which contained an identified Brady IRA victim Have further investigations shed more light? 2. 
It might be as well to check, in addition, that the police in this 
country are ready to deal with any IRA attacks on public utilities over Christmas, about which there have been several rumours. 3. 
In addition the following specific questions need attention:(i) 
Internment procedures. The Home Secretary raised with 
Mr. Faulkner at their recent meeting the possibility of improving these procedures, e. g. by giving an internee a written statement of the allegation against him; by considering appeals in two stages, with legal representation at one but not at the other; and by enlarging the Appeals Committee in order to accelerate the hearings. Mr. Faulkner undertook to submit proposals on all these points; but we should keep up the pressure to ensure that he does so. 
(ii) 
Internment accommodation. Arrests continue at a pretty high level; and the pressure on accommodation is again becoming acute. Against the background of the ICRC report, we cannot afford a scandal on this point; and, since there seems to be some difference of view between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence about the action to be taken (see the minute of 9th December from the Secretary of State for Defence to the Home Secretary), it would be useful to clarify this point and to define the responsibility for dealing with it.

24th November, 1971 
series but before taking up my present duties, I sent you some thoughts on Ireland in contemplation of the impending escalation. 
You may remember that on October 14th last year, after leaving the At the end I 
outlined a possible deal by which the Irish Government might at some stage be (politically) bribed to look up the I.R.A. 
I have just had similar 
thoughts fed back to me from an unexpected quarter, in very much the form I put them to you. 
2. Last Wednesday (November 17th) my wife and I refused an invitation 
to dine at the Irish Embassy (poor Donal O’Sullivan says he gets a very high proportion of refusals nowadays); but the dinner was cancelled and we agreed to go round for a quiet drink. 
I had not seen his for nearly a year, and though certainly I found his views very interesting, I thought it best to ask whether he had said all this stuff to his proper contacts such as Stewart Crawford. 
verbatim: "In a way, yes, but more by personal hints and indications, much less plainly... Andrew, you would do well to report this" 
3. His reply, 
I have hesitated for several days before troubling you with what may for all I know be pointless reading. 
However, Colley’s renewed public 
attack on the I.R.A. (Friday’s "Telegraph") has encouraged me to do so; and even the fact that the Ambassador wants his ideas reported may be of some small and useful significance to you. 
4. In brief, the deal would be:- 
(a) some (public) light at the end of the tunnel for the Republic. This would point not so such to a unified Ireland - 
which they 
are scared to death of - but towards their entitlement to have some say in considering the future of the North. 
(b) a constitutional change in Northern Ireland by which the minority would have a fair share in the management of affairs. 
(c) the internment of the I.R.A. by the Dublin Government. 
5. Naturally I asked whether the Irish Government was in a position to deliver (c). On this the Ambassador was most emphatic. 
Lynch was 
known to be willing, and Hillery, who was in many ways an awkward customer, had specifically said to O’Sullivans "We would certainly do it - I

I had about an hour with Donal.

Sir Burke St. John Trend, GCB, CVO would be for it." Colley’s new attitude might also be significant. 
24th November, 1971 But 
any move could come only as part of a deal: no Irish Government in the present climate of opinion would dare to move significantly against the I.R.A. without something which would really enable them to sway the Irish public in favour of a peaceful solution, and into acceptance of the measures needed to secure peace. 
6. That was the main point, and indeed O’Sullivan came back several 
times to the possibility of internment in the South. 7. 
Another noteworthy point was that O’Sullivan repeatedly pressed me I professed total ignorance (and very genuinely) but 
on whether some new political initiative by the British Government might be expected soon. 
said that if I myself were thinking of one, I would propose it for Christmas; he appeared to take this seriously. 
8. fears over the position of Lynch. 
The Ambassadors anxiety for an early British initiative arises from He contested with earnest emotion my 
suggestion that whoever succeeded Lynch would unavoidably and very speedily learn to follow (no worse than) a Lynch policy. 
The probable successor 
at present, he said, was Hillery, possibly a Hillery/Haughey partnership, which would be a reckless combination and cause us infinite trouble. 
election with a victory for the Opposition would be a disaster: even if they were to be regarded as worthy, they were incompetent and could not possibly cope with the I.R.A. the way Lynch could. 
translate this by saying that Fianna Fail are closer to the I.R.A. than Fine Gael and the Irish Labour Party; which is true). 
9. The word ’internment’ was not once mentioned but we got on to the subject of direct rule. 
was essential to maintain Stormont. 
O’Sullivan was most apprehensive over this: it When I probed this we decided that 
what he meant was not the constitution, but the constitutional status. He did not even want to see Stormont suspended, since he (very rightly) believes that any suspension would inevitably be permanent, because no one could ever contemplate restoring that very odd edifice. be a victory for the I.R.A. and a step towards civil war. 
10. A re-drawing of the border and an exchange of populations might once have been possible but in present circumstances would be an invitation to riot and bloodshed. 
11. I made relatively little contribution to the conversation except at the end when I picked up a reference of the Ambassador’s to the increasingly anti-British state of feeling in Dublin. 
should try to prevent their public being misled by the British media and by our well-known habit of discrediting our own forces. 
An (I suppose one could Direct rule would I told him that the Irish Government No huffing or puffing 
by Irish public opinion would lead to the result that many people in Dublin now appeared to regard as possible or available - that the British would not merely withdraw the troops from Northern Ireland but would disarm every single Protestant before doing so. 
That possibility was not available, so that 
any serious present-day attempt to secure the unification of Ireland could only lead to the spread of terror and destruction to the South, in fact to civil war. 
The Ambassador did not dissent, but my view is that the genuine 
fear of civil war, which was principally responsible for keeping the Irish in a restrained position during 1968 - 70, has recently been dissipated and should/

g r ounds i f , as one may hope, the impr oved situation both 
reduced the risk involved in setting free some of the internees, and increased the Availability of evidence on which others among them could be convicted. At the first signs of a real improvement the word could be allowed to get around that, while internment as such was certainly not being dispensed with immediately, the way in which it was applied was under reconsideration, 
7. As regards those already in internment, the obvious way to 
indicate a fresh approach would be to step up, the release of those who, in the improved situation, were regarded as only marginally a threat to security. This, would not necessarily mean overriding the existing review procedure (unless and until it was judged expedient for symbolic reasons to dispense with Judge Brown and his colleagues) but the review committee would need to be given fresh policy directions and perhaps additional personnel so as to speed up their work. As for the hard core of internees who could not safely be released, the hope would of course be to acquire sufficient evidence, in the improved situation, to be able to prosecute most of them. a. 
As regards wanted men who are still at large, the Government 
would certainly not wish to dispense altogether with the option of arresting ringleaders but it could be hinted fairly clearly that, since witnesses were showing greater willingness to come forward, the emphasis would thenceforth be on prosecution rather than internment and that the latter would in invoked, if at all, only for the most dangerous terrorists who were arrested in future.

used by the Secretary of State on the future of Interrogation; that the Government could not be expected to tie its hands, but would obviously be having full regard to 
- in this case - the improved security situation - and that the Press and public 
must read between the lines of those remarks.) It would have to be made clear in any pronouncements, official or unofficial, on internment that the subject was primarily the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government. Possible arms amnesty 9. 
In a period of much-reduced terrorism - whether or not there had been suggestions for a cease-fire - it would be worth 
considering whether to offer an amnesty for illegally held weapons. If this were done, it should also be made the occasion for trying to haul in some of the very many weapons held legally (mainly, of course, by the Protestants). This would need the sanction of a clear threat that in future the licencing of firearms would be much more stringent. If that could be agreed with the Northern Ireland Government, the initiative on this subject could then take the form of an announcement that licencing was in future going to be conducted more restrictively; that anyone who felt he could dispense with his firearms was therefore urged to hand them in; and that anyone handing in an unlicensed firearm - within a very limited period 
- would be immune from 
prosecution for having possessed it illegally. 10. Any such move would have to be carefully timed so that it was not obviously a response to some suggestion for a truce.

Suggestions for a Christmas truce 11. Proposals for a truce between the security forces and the IRA over the Christmas period should be treated just as any other truce proposals: ie by making it clear that there is no scope for a truce with criminals, that if the terrorists want a cease-fire it is up to them to stop shooting and bombing, and that the law must be upheld during Christmas in the same way as at any other time. Consultation with the Northern Ireland Government 12. If Ministers in London agree that it would be right, in a period of much-reduced terrorist activity, to ease up on security measures generally and internment in particular, they will wish to consider how they could best carry the Northern Ireland Government with them in thus varyingthe tactics 
- since the 
co-operation of the Northern Ireland authorities would be essential if the new approach were to achieve its object of generating further de-escalation, especially where internment is concerned. Any signs that terrorism was falling away significantly would therefore need to be made the occasion for immediate discussions with the Northern Ireland Government about tactics (which might well form part of wider discussions with them about the political future); and there would be a good case, at that point, for inviting Mr. Faulkner over for fresh talks.

NORTHERN IRELAND - INTERNMENT ACCOMMODATION As you know, there are immediate problems in providing 
sufficient accommodation for internees and detainees in Northern Ireland to keep pace with the number of terrorists on whom detention and internment orders are being served. 
2. The Northern Ireland Government have asked that, to deal 
with the bulk of the prospective excess, use should again be made of the accommodation ship MAIDSTONE 
- this time to house up to 150 internees. From the Army’s point of view, this is an 
extremely inconvenient request, since we had hoped to use MAIDSTONE (together with another accommodation ship HARTLAND POINT, which is being moved to Belfast later this month) for much-needed accommodation for soldiers during the winter months. Nevertheless, on the facts as presented to me, I can see no alternative: I have therefore reluctantly agreed that MAIDSTONE should be made available for this purpose. At the same time, I must place on record some dissatisfaction that the matter has been presented for Ministerial decision in this form and at such short notice, when Sir James Dunnett has for some time been drawing attention at his daily meetings to the evident need for the Prison Authorities to take steps to meet the crisis that was only too evidently developing and when I understand that the GOC has similarly been warning the Northern Ireland Government of the difficulties ahead. 
3. If MAIDSTONE is to be used it will of course be essential 
that there should be adequate arrangements for guarding the inmates. I learn from the GOC that the Northern Ireland Prison Service are hardpressed to find sufficient custodial staff for the task of guarding internees, and this problem will be aggravated by the re-opening of MAIDSTONE. No doubt you are considering this aspect of the matter. It may be something which should be raised at our GEN 47 meeting on Monday morning. 
I am copying this minute to the Prime Minister, to our other colleagues on GEN 47 and to Sir Burke Trend.

We took note then my Lords of the effect which internment had already begun to have, in denying to dangerous men the freedom of movement which they had previously enjoyed, and in greatly increasing the flow of intelligence about further terrorists and their activities. 
And we recognised then that, despite these improvements, it would be most unsafe to attempt to forecast how long it would take before terrorism could be brought to a halt. 
My Lords, moving on from that time to the present, I think it might be helpful if I were first to describe the current security situation - 
since, however much we may 
recognise that there can be no purely military solution, it remains vital to realise that the pace of progress in the political (and for that matter the economic) fields is very largely dictated by the state of security,

may now turn certain particular features of 
the security situation, I would first like to deal with the general question of marches and processions. 
At the time of the introduction of internment last August the Northern Ireland Government acting with the full support of the Government in London 
- imposed a total ban on marches in 
order to reduce the risk of provocation by members of one community towards those of another. 
That ban was for six months; but the Northern Ireland Government has now announced that it is to be extended for a further year. I am sure your Lordships will join me in strongly welcoming this decision. 
It will help in keeping down the temperature and will enable the security forces to get on with their priority task of dealing with the gunmen. I do not understand why there are some who apparently object to the ban.

It has of course been suggested that the one thing standing between the Catholics and the conference table is internment. 
My Lords, on the first occasion on which I spoke in your Lordships’ House following the introduction of internment, I said that I disliked as much as anyone the idea of holding people in custody without trial, and that only a very grave situation could possibly justify it - but that such a situation existed in Northern Ireland. This remains my view. 
I recognise entirely the sincerity of the Noble Earl in his opposition to internment; I must ask him in turn to recognise the sincerity of my own conviction and that of the Government, that the situation nevertheless continues to justify the use of internment at present,

I think it will be obvious, from what I have said about the present state of operations, why I consider that internment is still vital. 
One has only to look at the harm which is still being caused by those who have not yet been arrested, and by one or two of those who have escaped from detention, to gain some idea of what would be likely to happen if all those now in internment were to be suddenly released. 
One has only to look at the figures for the quantities of arms, ammunition and explosives which were found before the introduction of internment, and which have been found since then, to realise the effect it would have if the flow of information again dwindled to a trickle. 
Of course we should prefer to see these people prosecuted and convicted if that were possible; but quite obviously it is not, so long as intimidation remains rife.

And it is not much good arguing that intimidation exists only in our imagination, when only two weeks ago a bus driver who was about to give evidence for the Crown in an important case - 
Mr. Sidney Agnew - was murdered by 
masked gunmen in front of his family. And this was by no means an isolated example; there have been frequent reports to show what the IRA do to people who talk. What further evidence can one possibly need of intimidation? 
So how can one possibly bring internment to a sudden end against that background? No responsible government could take such an unjustifiable risk with the lives of soldiers and policemen and loyal citizens generally. 
What one can however do is to keep the policy of internment under review, so that those internees who are considered no longer to be a threat to security are released without delay, and so that - whenever witnesses are brave enough to come forward 
- the internee in question can be prosecuted.

whole raison d’etre of the operation for the last two and a half years and obviously now, after all the measures that have been taken, increasing almost fourfold the British military presence, internment is obviously only exacerbating the whole situation and I just want to ay

Mr. H. Well perhaps if you had condemned people beforehand who were going to challenge the law the march might not have taken place. Mr. L. I do not believe that would have happened anyway. Words would come easily from me but people are not going to obey or accord t o what I think might be done in certain circumstances. Mr. H. Well then, I am afraid that as long as they go on creating situations like this there is danger. Mr. L. Well there is, and there will be, and unless something is done from the Westminster side I am afraid this danger is going to continue.

Item 2: The Political Situation Mr. Lynch’s Intentions 3. A note of your meeting with Mr. Lynch has been circulated; and I 
have circulated a record of the meeting which Sir Stewart Crawford and I had with Mr. Lynch yesterday. You will wish to devote a little time to discussing the implications of Mr. Lynch’s planned initiative, particularly its link with, and its impact on, the Home Secretary’s plan if this is to go forward. 
If the Government judge that the moment for some conciliatory 
move has come and that the points of resemblance between Mr. Lynch’s initiative and the Home Secretary’s plan are sufficient to enable them to launch the latter under cover of, or in response to, the former, some careful co-ordination will be required, not excluding Mr. Faulkner. Mr. Lynch seemed to be only beginning to realise this yesterday; and we must move fast if we are to try to influence the content and timing of his proposed public speech. Perhaps the first step should be to recall Sir John Peck and Mr. Howard Smith for a combined "planning session". But should we, in additionsay anything to Mr. Faulkner tomorrow, perhaps basing it on his speech in Belfast on Monday? The Home Secretary’s Proposals 4. 
Discussion of the Home Secretary’s memorandum (GEN 47(72) 1) 
at the last meeting covered a good deal of ground; but you may want to begin the resumed discussion by hearing the Secretary of State for Defence, who was reported by Lord Balniel at the last meeting to be opposed to the Home Secretary’s plan. 5. 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary concentrated at the last 
meeting very much on the aspect of Commission Government. But that really no more than a piece of machinerywhich might, or might not, be needed to put a new system into operation; it is not of the essence of the system itself. The essence is the concept of statutorily guaranteed minority participation in the Government at Stormont; and this is sufficiently similar to Mr. Lynch’s proposal for "Community Government" to make it worthy commissioning the Home Secretary to elaborate his proposal by answering the questions which you put to Mr. Lynch in Brussels. 
(See page 8 of the 
record of that meeting). The Home Secretary should also be asked whether if his plan went forward, he could contemplate the "change of direction" as regards internment for Which Mr. Lynch is asking

6. In further considering the Home Secretary’s plan, it is worth 
looking back over the other options. One is to continue on present lines. But where would this lead us? What we call the present is not a static, let alone a satisfactory, situation. The JIC have been asked to make an assessment of the situation which would be likely to result if no political initiative were taken at this juncture. 7. 
The second possibility mentioned in the Home Secretary’s paper, 
to seek other Catholic representatives with whom to negotiate a settlement, seems as remote as ever (save in so far as it may be affected by Mr. Lynch’s plans). But the impending move of Unionists and ex-Unionists into the Alliance Party may well be a significant development, particularly if the movement were to stimulate more accessions to the Alliance Party by those previously committed to other Parties. 
It would be particularly striking if 
it led to accessions on the minority side. Even so, it would be improvident simply to wait and see what happens. While not closing any options, it would seem right to carry on with plans for implementing the Home Secretary’s third course if it commended itself generally to Ministers. Time is not on our side at the moment; and - as Mr. Lynch is acutely conscious 
- the 
opportunity for fruitful initiatives may not last for long. Finally it seems right to regard direct rule, if not as an alternative option, as being at least closely connected with the Home Secretary’s proposal in the sense that, if we could not secure agreement to the political changes which we wanted, we might be forced into direct rule; but, if we were, would we see the Home Secretary’s proposal as the most attractive outcome of a temporary period of direct rule or would we go for something even more radical? 8. As to the plan itself, the attached note identifies some of the main 
features which are receiving detailed consideration in the Home Office. Item 3: Security Situation 9. 
and from others as appropriate. Internment 10. 
You will wish to invite reports from the Chief of the General Staff Following the discussion on internment at the last GEN 47 meeting 
the Home Secretary was asked to consider whether the financial inducements for service in Northern Ireland by volunteer prison officers from Great Britain were adequate. 
It now appears that the dissatisfaction felt by 
certain prison officers related less to finance than to more general discomfort, particularly in the first days following the opening of Magilligan Camp. Now that Magilligan Camp is running more smoothly and a new Governor is in post, the atmosphere is understood to be happier.

11. Meanwhile, however, arrests continues and as at 21 January, those in custody - whether under Regulation 10, under a detention order or 
in internment - numbered 758 (of whom 543 were interned). Do the Army 
see any and to this process? And, if not, how soon must we be thinking about yet more guards and accommodation for internees? Last time we i.e. the Northern Ireland Government 
- left it very late before beginning to 
plan seriously. Marches and Demonstrations 12. You may wish to question the Secretary of State for Defence about recent suggestions in the Press and on tdevision that the Army over-reacted against some of the Civil Rights demonstrations last weekend and that, in particular, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment, by being unnecessarily rough, have gratuitously provoked resentment among peaceful elements of the Roman Catholic population. 13. 
Overshadowing this question, however, is the graver issue of the 
attitude to be adopted by the security forces if the renewed ban on marches is openly defied. Are we able 
- and prepared - to deal with that situation? 
Perhaps the question should be explored urgently with Mr. Faulkner during his visit to London.

Detailed Elements of the proposed Reform The meeting on 20th January agreed to resume its discussion of the 
Home Secretary’s paper (GEN 47(72) 1) with a view to identifying questions which might be referred to officials for further analysis or action. The chief of such questions, with some notes on the present state of their examination, appear to be as follows:(a) The Border. Should this be the subject of a referendum? Should there be local plebiscites; and, if so, how large should the local units be? How would the question be posed? What legislative provision would be required? The formula adopted in the instructions to Parliamentary Counsel is that the 1949 Act provision 
- i. e. that only with the agreement of the Northern 
Ireland Parliament shall Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of the United Kingdom - 
should be repealed 
and should be replaced by a provision that neither Northern Ireland nor any part thereof shall cease to be part of Her Majesty’s Dominions and of the United Kingdom unless a referendum (in the form prescribed in the Bill 
- the machinery 
should cause no trouble) establishes that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland support such a course. It would not be out of the question to hold a referendum related to part and not the whole of Northern Ireland. But the Republic is not likely to welcome such a course (which would reduce the proportion of Catholics in Northern Ireland and risk encumbering the Republic with unquiet areas); and the identification of areas suitable for local plebiscites would present difficulties. But the Home Secretary seems committed to the idea that the first plebiscite should not be held for 15 or 20 years. Would it be wrong, however, to inaugurate the reform with a plebiscite? 
(b) Transfer of Law and Order (i) What should this heading comprise? In GEN 47(71) 8 the Chairman of the Official Committee suggested the police, the Special Powers Acts, prosecutions, courts, prisons and internment camps and the probation and children’s ,services. It would thus involve all aspects of the internment policy, including decisions on the making of individual internment orders. There are other matters which might also have to

Planned march in Londonderry on Sunday 30 January 8. A further anti-internment march - which is likely to be the 
largest since they were commenced at Christmas - is planned for Londonderry next Sunday. The intention obviously is for the marchers to form up first within the Bogside and Creggan estates and to march for some distance within those areas, before emerging at a point where it will be feasible for the security forces to prevent them from continuing. It seems certain that television crews will be invited to record the early stages spectacle 
- and that Protestant reaction to the of a march apparently taking place unhindered will be 
strong. Preparatory thought is therefore being given to the public relations aspect of this event. 9. 
The choice of tactics for actually dealing with the march is essentially a matter for the Joint Security Committee - which is due 
to meet as usual on Thursday morning, 27 January. The Ministry of Defence and the Home Office are in touch respectively with the GOC and UK Rep about the line which they will be taking at that meeting.

Anti Internment Rallies 6. 
Rallies to demonstrate against internment were held on Saturday at 
Armagh and outside Magilligan Camp, and on Saturday at Lurgan and Castlowellan. Substantial crowds collected on each occasion and were addressed by speakers who included SDLP Members of Parliament at Westminster and Stormont. 
On

21 January 1972 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 14 JANUARY 1972 
- 20 JANUARY 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
Further discussions have been held on the arrangements for talks between the 
parties at Westminster. In Northern Ireland the ban on parades has been extended for a year, but defiance is planned by ’Loyalist’ as well as civil rights organisations. 
PARADES 2. 
The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland announced on 18 January that the 
existing ban on parades would be extended for a further 12 months when it expires on 8 February. The decision had been taken, he said, in order to prevent people from exposing the security forces and themselves to unnecessary dangers, and to enable the security forces to concentrate on the effort against terrorists. The situation would be 
pt under review so that, if the situation permitted, a 
relaxation of the ban might be considered. 3. 
The ban has been opposed by Mr Paisley, Mr Craig and some Unionist MPs (who 
have complained in particular about the failure to consult "loyalist" organisations beforehand), as well as by the Social Democratic and Labour Party. 
A motion of censure on the Government for its decision has been signed by two members of the Unionist Party 
4. - Captain Mitchell and Mr Laird - as well as three 
members of the Democratic Unionists and Mr Craig. The motion is due to be debated on 25 January. 
The Loyalist Workers’ Association, led by William Hull, has declared its 
opposition to the ban and plans to march in defiance of it. So has the Civil Rights Association. Spokesmen for the Orange Order, and other Protestant organisations associated with traditional parades have expressed opposition to the decision. 
5. Anti-internment marches are being planned in spite of the ban, and one in 
Armagh for 22 January may be accompanied by a Protestant counter-demonstration. INTER-PARTY TALES 6. 
In December the Labour Party had announced that it would be seeking an 
assurance from the Government that any subject could be raised during the proposed inter-party talks. (See HONIP(71) 51 paragraph 5). On 14 January the Home Secretary replied to a letter from Mr Callaghan which had asked for this assurance confirming that any relevant topic could be raised, although those who joined in the talks would do so without prejudice to their known positions. The Home Secretary added that, since the opposition parties in Northern Ireland were maintaining their refusal to participate in talks,the next step might be for discussions between the Opposition and Government at Westminster to be renewed. On 19 January the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary met Mr Wilson to discuss the proposed talks.

of Mr Wilson, Mr Callaghan, Mr Rees, and Mr McNamara as its representatives in tho talks at all stages. 
SECURITY SITUATION 8. 
It was reported on 18 January that the Labour Party had approved the choice In Belfast over the weekend there were a number of shooting incidents, in one 
of which a soldier was severely injured, and minor street disturbances when stones and nail bombs were thrown. Armed robberies continued - particularly on book makersbut amounts taken were generally small. The Army have continued to make successful arms searches in the city, recovering weapons and ammunition. On 18 January a man was shot dead by gunmen at his home. He was an important Crown witness in a trial arising out of the hijacking of a bus. But his deposition had already been made and was declared admissible. On 20 January the accused were convicted and sentenced, one to ten years’ imprisonment, the other two to eight years’. 
9. In Londonderry there have been shooting incidents and on 18 January an RUC 
car was stolen and taken into the Bogside. The Rosemount RUC station cane under attack the same day. The next day there were explosions at an electricity transformer and a factory. Small-scale rioting has ccntinued throughout the week, especially at the weekend and on 19 January. Nail bombs and stones have been thrown and CS gas and baton rounds used to disperse the crowds of youths and women. 
10. There have been a number of incidents elsewhere in the Province. In Craigavon on 14 January an RUC officer was injured by a bomb which had been connected to the engine of his car. There have been shooting and bomb attacks on soldiers at Lurgan, and in Newry there were two fires and six explosions, targets including an electricity transformer and a school and,on 20 January, a tax office, where 9 people were injured. In the mountains east of Strabane, over 1,500 rounds of ammunition were found in an Army search on 15 January. There were disturbances in the town on 19 January. On the border, a temporary customs caravan at Tullydonell was towed away and soldiers cae under attack at Belleek on 16 and 17 January. Cross-border shooting incidents occurred at Garrison and near Newtownbutler on 19 January. 
11. Seven detainees escaped from HMS Maidstone on the evening of 17 January by sawing through a bar in a porthole and swimming ashore where they hijacked a bus which was later found abandoned. An intensive search of the area and the sealing off of all roads out of Belfast failed to produce the men. Mr Faulkner made a statement about the circumstances of the escape in the Northern Ireland Parliament the next day and said that a detailed investigation was already under way. 
12. A large scale search of the Long Kesh internment camp was made on 20 January by 1,200 soldiers and 60 police. Two holes which might have been the start of escape tunnels were discovered and tools, offensive weapons, imitation sub-machine guns, combat jackets, counterfeit money and training manuals were also found, as well as a still for making spirit from potatoes. 
ETRADITION 
13. A warrant for the arrest of Anthony Docherty, on a charge of possessing a loaded revolver during an incident in February 1971 when two RUC officers were shot dead, was issued in Belfast on 17 January and is to be sent to the Republic with an application for his return for trial. (Docherty was one of the officers of the Provisional IRA to escape from detention on 2 December 
- see HONIP(71) 49 
paragraph 11. He is currently on bail in the Republic on a charge of possessing a stolen car.)

Incidents in the last 24 hours There were no major incidents during the period. In Co. 
Fermanagh there were two instances of shots being fired across the border from the Republic: near Garrison, at a sapper working party and its 16/5 Lancers escort while an unapproved road was being cratered, and at Aghalane, at a bomb disposal officer and his escort. In Londonderry four shots were fired at the Blighs Lane Post and three nail bombs were thrown at troops in William Street. 2. 
Also in Londonderry there were two explosions, one of which 
started a fire and attracted a crowd of 200 which beame rowdy. In Belfast a bomb which two youths left in a suitcase at an electrical shop was defused by a bomb disposal officer; and another bomb planted in a loading bay at a chemical works in the Shankill Road area failed to detonate when its fuse burnt out.

some prominene in today’s Press, but it is understood that the RUC intend to assert quite openly that the murder can only have been for the purposes of preventing the victim from giving evidence and of discouraging other potential witnesses in this and other cases. 8. 
It will be important to record all such evidence, whether or 
not substantiated, of IRA intimidation: since it will be crucial to the British response to the case being brought by the Irish Government before the Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg, so far as it is concerned with internment as an alleged violation of Article Five 
- intimidation being the basic reason why the terrorists 
cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the law. Details are accordingly being sought of another new development which has been reported, that about six of the civilian labourers employed at Magilligan Camp have left as a result of intimidation. There may also be evidence of attempts to intimidate some of the warder staff at the internment camps. Arrest of Sean Collins 9. 
Collins, a senior figure in the Provisional IRA - who was arrested in Newry on the night of 13 January - is being charged with 
a wounding offence committed in 1969. A check is being made of whether the fact of being charged necessarily prevents him from undergoing ordinary Special Branch interrogation, as the RUC have suggested it does. 10. Today’s Irish newspapers carry reports alleging that Collins was kidnapped - and/or the SAS - 
either by rival elements of the IRA, or by the RUC in Dundalk, south of the border, before being taken 
to Northern Ireland. The RUC have put out a statement dismissing these reports as nonsense Possible use of a launcher for nail bombs 11. There is a report, as yet unconfirmed that the IRA in Londonderry are experimenting with some form of launcher to project nail bombs against the security forces. If this is true, it seems

Northern Ireland 
Inter Party Talks You will wish to tell your colleagues about your meeting with 
Mr. Wilson (and perhaps about your discussion with the Irish Ambassador on Tuesday?). 
Depending on the outcome of your exchanges with 
Mr. Wilson, the Committee may need to devote a little time to considering the modalities of any inter-Party talks, including the composition of the delegations (? only Privy Counsellors); the agenda (? excluding reunification, at least so far as we and Stormont are concerned); and the Government’s role (? passively auditory or actively vocal). The Political Situation (GEN 47(72) 1) 2. 
The Committee may find it difficult to quarrel either with the 
Home Secretary’s assertion that only three courses of action are open to us or with his reasons for dismissing the first two of these in favour of the third, i. e. his own plan. They may also accept his definition (at the top of page 3) of the three elements which that plan must comprise. 
But, 
before examining those elements in detail, the Committee should consider the basic question of the relationship between the plan and direct rule, i.e. the question whether the plan has some hope of succeeding and so avoiding direct rule or whether it is almost bound to end in, if not actually to precipitate, direct rule itself. 3. 
The answer must depend, of course, on its acceptability to the two 
communities. As regards the Catholics the fact that the plan rejects reunification (at least until the first plebiscite about the Border is held in 15 or 20 years’ time) is bound to count against it. Moreover, even a guarantee (based on legislation at Westminister) of minority participation in government may not be a sufficient inducement without some corresponding assurance of equal participation in the subordinate levels of administration. On the other hand, acceptance of the plan would presumably ensure the end of internment; and, if the law and order function were simultaneously transferred to Westminister, the balance of advantage might - one cannot say more - appear to the Catholics to be worth accepting. As regards the Protestants, there can be no certainty that Mr. Faulkner could stomach the plan or that, if he fell, anybody could

Reference 1 - 50.00% Coverage
Page 1 : (0,0) - (624,847)
Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
5. As regards the details of the plan, its first element is the plebiscite 
on the Border. The Home Secretary proposes not holding the first plebiscite for 15 or 20 years. Would this be right? A plebiscite may hold out rather better hope of excluding the Border from day to day politics than the present system; but the Republicans would still be likely to complain that it was unfairly loaded against them and that the result was a foregone conclusion. 
If a plebiscite were decided on, would it be on a universal 
basis, or on a territorial basis with the possibility of ceding territory (with all the emotional dangers that involves for Londonderry)? 6. 
It may be better to consider the powers to be left with the 
Northern Ireland Government before examining how the corresponding responsibilities would be administered. The transfer of responsibility for law and order may be right in principle; but there would be some rough edges in practice. The civil disobedience campaign and the measures to counter it are in essence matters of law and order, although they are not so handled as a matter of machinery. The transfer of law and order except on the narrowest interpretation (and there are a number of gradations) would involve us in responsibility for internment. How far is internment to be brought into the political package? 7. 
When we come to the composition of the Government to exercise the 
residual powers, the Home Secretary suggests a compulsory coalition i. e. a coalition enforced by legislation at Westminster. Normally, we envisage a coalition as being between the "regular" Unionists and the Roman Catholic minority. 
Is it intended, however, that it should embrace 
Paisleyites? A coalition, if it was to satisfy the minority, would tend to distort Parliamentary life at Stormont. If we needed to take the Parliamentary institution at Stormont seriously, this might matter; but sectarian conflict is more concerned with administrative than with legislative power. A coalition Government would therefore need to be supplemented by action at the administrative grass-roots, designed to ensure the minority their fair share of appointments on public boards, authorities, etc. 8. 
There are clearly several aspects of the plan which need further 
examination; and the Committee may wish to remit it to officials for detailed consideration as a matter of urgency, against the moment when it may be opportune to launch it. But Ministers should first indicate:(a) whether they endorse it in principle, as a last effort to achieve a solution by agreement rather than by the imposition of direct rule;

(b) whether they intend that it should play any part in any inter-Party 
talks which may be arranged or whether it is to be held in reserve to be put forward as a specifically Government initiative at the most opportune moment. Internment 
9. A number of practical considerations regarding internment are 
relevant to the substance and timing of a political initiative. 10. 
Either the improvement of the security situation or a political 
requirement to conciliate the Catholics may prompt some modification of the internment policy, starting perhaps with the release of some of the less harmful internees. 
But what is being done to identify the less dangerous 
internees. and to arrange for their segregation from the hard core? Practically nothing according to paragraph 19 of Current Situation Report No. 56 of 17th January! The Home Secretary should therefore be asked when progress may be expected both in this regard and in respect of "rehabilitation", about which General Ford spoke to you when you visited Northern Ireland last month. (It will be desirable, however, to be clear on what is meant by "rehabilitation"; and on the financial responsibility for any resulting expenditure. 11. We also understand that the Northern Ireland Government have under consideration a number of proposals for improving the internment procedure, e. g. by using a Tribunal not only to review the cases of persons already interned but to make recommendations on whether internment orders should be served on persons detained. You may wish to ask what pressure is being put on Stormont to consider this seriously. 12. 
The Protestants’ reaction to any political initiative will be affected by 
their assessment of the security situation; and from this aspect every major escape of internees or detainees is politically, as well as practically, unfortunate. The last GEN 47 meeting was informed that the Northern Ireland Prison Service had been supplied with the best possible advice on measures to prevent escapes. The extent to which the recent escape from HMS Maidstone reflects blame upon the internal guards provided by the Northern Ireland Prison Service, or on the external guards provided by t security forces, is not entirely clear; but you may wish again to ask the and Defence Secretaries whether they are completely satisfied that ever possible is being done to prevent escapes.

Irish Ministers 
had refrained from commenting publicly on the situation in Northern Ireland in recent weeks because they did not wish to prejudice any political initiative which might be in prospect. 
It would, however, be difficult 
that such camps ought not be located in remote, inaccessible places, but reasonably near the centres of population, so that relatives could visit internees. The reason why an additional camp was needed was ghat more and more wanted men were being arrested and it was because of this that the IRA were now in some difficulty. He had pointed out some time ago to Mr. Lynch that, if internment were to be introduced in the South as well as in the North, as it had been during the previous IRA campaign, much quicker and more effective action could be taken against the terrorists. He had however refrained from taxing Mr. Lynch publicly with this. Mr. Lynch had to realise that an immediate release of all internees, as the SDLP had proposed, was quite unacceptable.

Nothing emerged from these discussions to Internment policy 
17. The latest available figures for internments, detentions and releases are attached at Annex. 18. The opening of Magilligan Camp on Sunday, with the transfer of forty detainees from HMS MAIDSTONE, has given rise to a good deal of speculation about the future of internment generally and, in particular, about the number of people whom the security authorities think it will be necessary to intern in order to render the IRA ineffective. 
There can in fact be no exact answer to this question 
since, although we have a fairly clear idea of the number of activists that there were in each wing of the IRA immediately before internment, it is clear that they have been able to recoup at least some of their losses with new recruits 
- though it in also very 
clear that, in the process, the competence which their operations are conducted has fallen away considerably. 19. In the event of a more pronounced lull in terrorism 
may well be a case for some acceleration in the rate of release of internees 
- it will of course be important to know a good deal 
about how relatively dangerous each of them is. The Northern Ireland Government have made practically no headway so far in sorting the internees physically into categories 
- for which they are apparently 
now laying the blame on the shortage of accommodation which has obtained hitherto. However, the Advisory Committee under Judge Brown has by now reviewed, at least once, the case against about threequarters of those interned; they should therefore have some idea of those who might qualify for release if the criteria wre altered somewhat. 20.

14. January 1972 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 7 JANUARY 1972 
- 13 JANUARY 1972 Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL 1. 
There have been no significant political developments this week. In the 
Republic, the growing unemployment problem has diverted some attention from the North but there are indications that the Government is concerned about the need to strengthen security measures. A member of the RUC Reserve and a UDR Sergeant have been shot dead in Belfast. 
REPORT ON SECURITY AT CRUMLIN ROAD PRISON 
2. Mr Faulkner announced in the Northern Ireland Parliament on 11 January that Sir Charles Cunningham had submitted his report on security at Crumlin Road prison and that the report recommended the speedy completion of measures to improve physical security, including the provision of new fencing, additional lighting and more watchtowers. Action was in hand on these and on other recommendations for the provision of further physical security precautions. 
3. The report had also recommended that the number of categories of inmates 
held in the prison should be reduced, on which action was being taken, and that the proportion of experienced officers among the staff should be increased. This recommendation was under consideration. The report said that ultimately the only satisfactory answer would be to build a secure prison of modern design on a different site. This recommendation was receiving immediate and detailed study 
ARMS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND CABINET MINISTERS 4. 
It was reported on 12 January that Northern Ireland Cabinet Ministers had 
been issued with arms to protect themselves and their homes in the event of attack by gunmen. Opposition MPs were also being allowed to carry weapons if they requested them. The decision to allow Cabinet Ministers to carry arms was condemned by the Northern Ireland Labour Party. 
RUC RESERVE 5. 
It was announced on 11 January that, on the recommendation of the Police 
Authority, it had now been agreed that the authorised establishment of the Reserve should be increased from 1,500 to 2,500, and that provision should be made for full-time service by members of the Reserve in support of the regular force, on a short-term basis, to relieve the heavy burden placed on the regular force by station-protection duties. 
NEW INTERNMENT CAMP 6. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs announced on 7 January that a second internment 
camp would be opened at Magilligan in Co. Londonderry as a contingency move. The camp would be sited at a former Army barracks. Mr Faulkner dismissed reports 
that a third camp was to be opened elsewhere in the Province.

approach the Metropolitan Police to explore whether volunteers might be forthcoming from that force for secondement to Northern Ireland to assist the RUC Special Branch with the interrogation of wanted persons when they are at police holding centres just after arrest. At present such interrogation is lacking in intensity, and thus failing to produce as much information as it might, because the RUC Special Branch are short-handed. Possible Panorama programme 9.

23 February, 1972 I am enclosing a summary of Emergency Powers Legislation 
in the Irish Republic, and also a short summary of the use of the Powers since 1939. As you will see, the legislation falls under two heads, 
- the Offences against the State Act, and 
the Emergency Powers Act. Although the Emergency Powers Act is still in force, it is unlikely that the Irish Government would now use it in preference to the Offences against the State Act which provided the powers used in 1956-62. 
Detention and special criminal courts are separate 
weapons to be used as appropriate according to circumstances : the courts give fixed sentences, whereas detention or interment have no fixed term. The special courts are sometimes referred to as military courts because during the Second World War they were staffed by Army Officers; such courts are not to be confused with Courts Martial, which can only try persons who are or who have been made subject to military law. 
I am also enclosing a short summary of the relevant 
extract from Mr. O’Malley’s statement on 20 February, together with a copy of Section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936, to which Mr. O’Malley referred. You will recall Mr. O’Malley told the Fianna Fail Party Conference that some recent decisions in lower courts had been inexplicable and those then discharged could nonetheless be brought before a higher court. 
Since this letter and its enclosures may be of general 
interest, I am sending copies to Gregson (No. 10), Angel (Home Office) and Andrew (MOD).

EMERGENCY LEGISLATION IN THE REPUBLIC 1. 
Emergency legislation (detention without trial and 
special courts) is enshrined in four Acts: the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940, and the Emergency Powers Acts, 1939 and 1940. 
Legislation and Powers 2. 
The Offences Against the State Act, 1939 (which came 
into force on 14 June, 1939 lays down penalties against persons who seek to usurp the function of government, obstruct government or try to interfere with military or other employees of the state. It prohibits the printing and publishing of certain documents, the possession of such documents and the distribution of foreign newspapers containing seditious material. It also prohibits unauthorised 
military exercises (Section 15), secret societies in the army or police (Section 16) and the administering of unlawful oaths (Section 17). 
3. Part 3 declares that certain organisations (which are 
described but not named) shall be unlawful. The Government may issue a Suppression Order against any organisation it deems unlawful; it is then unlawful for any person to be a member of that organisation, and the property of the organisation is forfeit to the Minister for Justice. Part 4 of the Act prohibits meetings held by unlawful organisations. 
4. Part 5 of the Act, dealing with special criminal courts, is 
to be brought into force "if and whenever and so often as the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order and that it is therefore necessary that this part of this Act should come into force 
... ". The Government The Government may bring Part 5 into effect 
by proclamation(and annul the proclamation by a subsequent one); Dail Eireann can annul the first proclamation by passing a resolution to that effect (Section 36(6)). 
may by Order declare that particular cusses of offences shall be scheduled offences for the purposes of Part 5 of the Act, and every such offence must be tried by the special courts. 
5. Part 5 also provides for "special criminal courts" to 
consist of an uneven number of at least 3 members, appointed and removed at will by the Government, drawn from judges of the High, Circuit or District Court, barristers and solicitors of not less than 7 years’ standing, and officers of the Defence Forces not below the rank of Commandant. Verdicts are by majority: each court has power to lay down its own procedure (eg on the admission or exclusion of the public, the enforcing of the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents) with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice. The practice and procedure of the ordinary criminal courts are to apply "so far as practicable" to the special criminal courts: rules of evidence are to apply. Provision is made for appeals

but only if either the special criminal court or the Court of Appeal give leave to appeal. 
6. 7. Part 6 of the Act provided for powers of internment, but was 
soon found to be repugnant against the Constitution and replaced (see below). 
September 1939) made provision for public safety by extraordinary measures during the Second World War. Despite attempts to repeal it, it is still in force. Section 2 (2) (k) and (1) provide that the Government may, by Emergency Order, authorise and provide for the detention of persons other than natural born Irish citizens where such detention is, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary or expedient in the interests of the public safety for the preservation of the State; and authorises the arrest without warrant of persons other than natural born Irish citizens whose detention has been ordered or directed by a Minister. 
The Emergency Powers Act, 1939 (which came into force on 3 8. The Emergency Powers (Amendment) Act, 1940 (which came into 
force on 5 January 1940) simply deleted the saver "other than natural-born Irish citizens" from Section 2 (2) (k) and (1) of the principal Act. 
9. 
The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940 (which came into force on 9 February, 1940) repealed Part 
of the 1939 
Act, which had been found repugnant to the Constitution, and substituted new powers of detention which evaded the legal issue involved. Part 2 may be brought into force or annulled by Government Proclamation, which must declare in the former case that the powers are necessary’to secure the preservation of public peace and order". 
Again, the Dail may annul a 
proclamation bringing Part 2 into force by passing a resolution to that effect. Part 2 lays down (Section 4) that "whenever a Minister of State is of opinion that any particular person is engaged in activities which, in his opinion, are prejudicial to the the preservation of public peace and order or to the security of the State, such Minister may ... order the arrest and detention of such person under this Section". Persons named by the Minister may be arrested without warrant and detained. The Minister is given powers to set up and run detention camps. Section 8 of the Act provides for the establishment of a Commission as soon as conveniently may be after Part 2 comes into force, consisting of 3 persons: one an army officer and each of the others a barrister or solicitor of standing or a serving or retired judge. Any person detained may apply to the Government to have the Commission consider his detention: 
the Government 
must refer the matter to the Commission and furnish all relevant documents; "if the Commission reports that no reasonable grounds exist for the continued detention of such person, such person shall, with all convenient speed, be released.". 
Section 9 
of the Act provides that the Government shall once at least in every six months furnish to each House of the Oireachtas particulars of persons detained, persons reported on by the Commission, etc, etc. 10.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 83 -. 23 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Events in Northern Ireland itself were of course largely 
overshadowed by the explosion at Aldershot, details of which have already been reported 
- and covered very fully in the Press. 
the Province, the level of activity was much the same as usual in recent weeks. 2. 
Within In Belfast there were four explosions and four shooting incidents, 
in one of which a civilian was injured. There was also some trouble in the Ardoyne during the early stagesof the funeral of David cAuley, the fourteen-year-old youth who died in the Republic on Saturday from a gunshot wound. As several hundred mourners assembled round the coffin, a volley of five shots was fired over it. Two sections of 1 QLR who were standing by tried to break through the crowd to arrest those who had fired the volley; whilst doing so they were jostled and the platoon commander was knocked down and kicked in the face. He was extricated after two baton rounds had been fired and also one rifle-shot into the area. In the melee one woman was injured. Once the cortege started moving the procession became orderly, though some of its members were in breach of the law in wearing para-military uniforms. McAuley’s father, who is an internee at Long esh, was allowed out on parole for the funeral he had not reported back by 4 p.m. 3. 
In Londonderry there were outbreaks of shooting, two of them at troops - without casualties. There was also the usual amount of 
hooligan activity during the afternoon, but it was observed that some adults seemed to be trying to persuade the youths to disperse. It is the first time this has been seen happening for some time. 4. 
In the rural areas there were three shooting incidents. In one

5. There has been full Press coverage for the discovery that a 
boy of 14 from the Ardoyne whose body was found in a hearse travelling from the Republic towards Belfast 
- with a death certificate signed by 
a doctor at the Louth County Infirmary in Dundalk saying that death was due to a non-infectious disease - 
had in fact been shot in the 
stomach. It is thought likely that he had been accidentally shot at an IRA training camp in the Republic. Widgery Inquiry. 6. 
Lord Widgery, in his remarks at the beginning of the opening 
session of the inquiry at Coleraine yesterday, clarified the way in which he intends to interpret his terms of reference and his earlier remarks that he would be concerned only with what happened in Londonderry on 30 January. He made it clear that under this formula it would be possible for him to hear about the orders given to the Army but not the political or military thinking behind those orders. This is a satisfactory approach, in that it should provide opportunities to refute the allegations that the troops had orders to kill any men of military age who were in the vicinity of a disturbance 
- while at the 
same time it seems likely to draw Catholic witnesses into giving evidence. 7. 
It has been confirmed that Counsel for the Army has been provided 
with a copy of the full transcript of the BBC news film in which the priests and others made statements immediately after the shootings. It will be interesting to see whether these tally with what they say in front of the tribunal. Criticism of Army Doctors 8. 
The Irish press have published a letter which the indefatigable 
Father Fall has sent to the British Medical Council, calling in question the professional detachment of British Army doctors who have been present when alleged atrocities against prisoners and detainees have occurred. (Similar criticism was voiced by the County Court judge

in the W J Moore case). Consideration is being given to ways of countering such criticism; this could include publicity for the work of the RAMC in coming to the aid of civilian casualties in the streets of Northern Ireland. There might also be an inspired letter to the same newspapers, asking whether Father Fall now intends to complain to the medical authorities in Dublin about the conduct of the doctor at the Infirmary in Dundalk (para 5 above).

22 February 1972 The Prime inister has asked that the Defence 
Secretary should look at the attached telegrams nos. 18 and 19 of 17 February from Belfast to the Home Office about a paper put forward jointly 
and the R.U.C. 
assessing the security implications of the release of internees. 
the Joint Security Committee, 
wrong that the Army should have joined with the R.U.C. in putting a paper on this subject to the Joint Security 
Committee and that we should endeavour to 
prevent this kind of thing happening in the future. The Prime Minister was also surprised to learn 
that the Northern Ireland Government were contemplating issuing a statement about internment. In his view no such statement should be made at this time. 
the paper it was asserted that the members of the R.U.C. Special Branch "are for the most part known to those internees whom they have arrested or interrogated". If this is so, it removes part of the objection to bringing internees to trial, if necessary In some special court.

more favourable views began to be heard. Father Paul, for 
examples said that the civilians should perhaps cooperate if there was no other way of getting the facts established. The seven Londonderry priests decided on February 17 that they will appear. 
7. Allegtions of brutality continue. Fathers Paul and Murray are making army doctors their target. The Irish News of 
February 17 printed a copy of a letter sent to the British Medical Association and the Medical Practitioners’ Union, which accused Army doctors of unthical paticipation in interrogation. The BMA and BMU are asked to investigate thse serious allegations. 
8. The same issue carried two stories, which inferred that the leal profession is increasingly opposing certain aspects of the security operation. Seven defence lawyers threatened to walk out of the Newry Petty Sessions court if their clients were not granted a month’s adjournment of the hearing of charges arising 
from the Newry Civil Rights larch. A Belfast solicitor walked out of the Advisory Committee reviewing the cases of internees,

Terrorist activity during the week has followed the recent were well down compared with the previous week. An 
has been a marked improvement in Garda cooperation at the local level. It remains to be seen whether the release of Mechan, Docherty and five others at Dundalk without trial will affect this. 
10. In the evening of 11 February four armed men broke into the houses of UDR soldiers in the Armagh area and stole three SLRs and 60 rds of ammunition. On 16 February an ACF cadet was kidnapped and questioned for two hours by four masked men near Armagh. This is the first incident involving cadets. On 13 February the body of a RAOC Private soldier serving in Northern Ireland was found Last of the border town of Newtonbutler. He was officially on leave to visit his ailing mother in the Republic. He had been bound and gagged and then shot in the back of his head. 
11. An incendiary bomb started a fire in one of the fuel storage tanks in Newry on 14 February destroying approximately 20,000 gallons of petrol. The Fire Brigade had the fire under control within a quarter of an hour. On the same day a patrol went to investigate an explosion at Aghalane Customs Post when it came under fire from across the border. Fire was returned but no hits are claimed. 
12. Following an explosion near Belleek on 11 February, a 16/5 L ambush captured four armed men in a car who admitted their guilt for that and other acts of terrorism. They were based in Hire.

14. On 11 February a bomb severly damaged the Fire Station in Dungiven and the Tootal Tie Factory near Londonderry Was destroyed by an explosion and fire. On 12 February a large bomb caused severe damage to the Woodleas Hotel in the Creggan Estate whilst a wedding reception was in progress. The best man was shot in the head while he was trying to tackle the gunman as he planted the bomb. These latter two incidents were strongly attacked by the Goulding IRA, largely because of public anger within the Catholic community in Londonderry. 
15. On February 16 a Catholic budriver, who was a member of 5 UDR, was abducted by four armed men in the Croggan Estate and later brutally murdered. Five internees attempted to escape from Magilligan Camp but were recaptured by the staff without military assistance. 
39. InfantryBrigade 16. Shootings continue on a reduced scale but certain areas, and in particular Ballymacarrett, appear to be returning to normality. An attempt was made to murder a member of the UDR which failed when the weapon failed to fire. 17. The recent reduction in explosions has not been maintained. An influx of explosive has resulted in some 20 explosions and several unsuccessful attempts. Lost have been concentrated on commercial property in and around the city centre, but included has been the first attempt at a major explosion on a ferry. 18. The "wanted" arrest level still remains nigh with several important IRA officers amongst those captured. There have also been several good arms finds. In general, the Security Forces grip on both win g s of the IRA continues to tighten. 
JOINT SECURIT COMMUNITEE MEETING - 17 FEBRUARY 
19. The security implications of the release of internees was discussed. It was agreed that a comprehensive press release setting out the law relating to internment and other pertinent facts should be produced. UK Rep agreed to advise on this. 
Outlook 
20. Security force activity in Belfast is likely to reduce still further the ability of either faction of the IRA to undertake sustained activity in the City. It is to be expected that crossborder activity, and activity in other rural areas, will continue to be the main IRA tactic. 
21. There are four or five Ulster Vanguard Rallies planned for 18-19 February, which collectively should provide an indication of the support which the new organisation has attracted. The Rallies are unlikely to present serious security problems. 
22. Northern Ireland has, so far, been comparitively unaffected by the power shortages resulting from the minors’ strike, but the situation could deteriorate towards the and of the period. Any large scale labour disputes arising from this could have security repercussions.

SPECIAL COURT Recognizing the political impasse, and feeling of community 
alienation, resulting from internment, but also recogizing that the needs of justice demand that witnesses and jurors should be free from physical fear we recommend the follwing:- 
That a Special Court should be set up to try offences under the undermentioned Acts: (i) Explosive substances Act 1893 S2,3,4, & 5. (11) Firearms Act (N.I.) 1969 S14,15,16,18 18(1), 19. (111) Explosive substances Act 1875 S4, & 5. (lv) Protection of Persons and Property Act (N.I.) 1969 S1,2,3. (v) 
Public Order (Amendment) Act (N.I.) S7.8.(if on indictment) Any person charged under the above provisions shall be tried at the 
Special Court. No bail shall be allowed on any of these charges unless there are special humanitarian reasons. COMPOSITION: A High Court Judge; and two Senior Queen’s Counsel appointed by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland to sit and assist the Judge. 
Those sitting on the Bench would have Inquisitional powers. 
PROCEDURE: A Crown Representative to present the case, and the Defendant would have a right to legal representation. WITNESSES: 
Police should attend the Court in person, but with the right to remain anonymous. Identities to be disclosed only to the bench. They would be subject to examination and cross-examination. CIVILIAN WITNESSES: 
- Witnesses who are members of the Security Forces or th - Would have the right if they so wished to giv

THERE SHOULD BE TALKS BETWEEN THE IRISH AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS, ITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ELECTEC REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO 
(III#) IMMEDIATE MEASURES. on INTERIM POLICIES, I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THE GOVERNMENT’S 
POSITION. WE CALLED LAST AUGUST FOR THE ENDING OF THE STORMONT REGIME AND FOR ITS REPLACEMENT BY A NEW FORM OF ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH POWER AND DECISION-MAKING WOULD BE EQUALLY SHARED BETWEEN UNIONIST AN NON-UNIONIST. I EXPLAINED OUR REASON FOR THIS IN DAIL EIREANN LAST OCTOBER. IT IS THAT NORTHERN IRELAND IS NO ORDINARY DEMOCRACY: IT IS INSTEAD A CAREFULLY CHOSEN ENCLAVE WHOSE DEMOGRAPHY ENSURES THAT, EVEN IF DEMOCRATIC 
NORTHERN COMMUNITIES, TO ARRIVE AT THE KIND OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS SUITABLE TO THE NORTH: AND REMEMBER I AM TALKING ABOUT INTERIM PROPOSALS. IT MAY BE NECESSARY, WHILE SUCH TALKS TAKE PLACE , TO ADMINISTER 
PRINCIPLES WERE STRICTLY 
OBSERVED AND APPLIED, ONE COMMUNITY HOLDS POWER PERMANENTLY. IN ITS GREEN PAPER OF OCTOBER LAST THE STORMONT REGIME ADMITS THAT ’’ IT IS A FACT THAT NORTHERN IRELAND HAS NOT, IN THE COURSE OF FIFTY YEARS, BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT HIGH DEGREE OF STABILITY AND GENERAL ACCEPTANCE WHICH CHARACTERISES THE BRITISH DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.’ IN CREATING A NEW FORM OF ADMINISTRATION, THEREFORE, THE FIRST 
ESSENTIAL IS THAT THE MONOPOLY OF POWER NOW RESIDING IN ONE COMMUNITY, BECAUSE OF THE OPERATION OF THE BRITISH SYSTEM OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A DIFFERENT KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN WHICH POWER IS DELIBERATELY SHARED BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES: THE SECOND ESSENTIAL IS THAT THE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR POLITICAL ACTION MUST INCLUDE THE THE INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS TO ADVOCATE AND WORK FOR A CHANGE IN RELATIONS WITH LONDON AND DUBLIN WITHOUT BEING DEBARRED IN ANY WAY FROM PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SO DOING. MY VIEW IS THAT, UNTIL THE DAY COMES WHEN AN IRISH PARLIAMENT 
AND GOVERNMENT WILL LOOK AFTER THE WHOLE OF IRELAND, WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE FUNCTIONING IN THE NORTH A SPECIFICALLY IRISH, INSTITUTION APPROPRIATELY STRUCTURED SO AS TO ENABLE THE ENERGIES OF THE TWO COMMUNITIES TO BE USED IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. /THERE SHOULD 
THE AFFAIRS OF THE NORTH THROUGH AN INTERIM COMMISSION. SUCH A COMMISSION WOULD REPRESENT NO THREAT TO DEMOCRACY SINCE ITS PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WOULD BE COTERMINCUS WITH THE DISCUSSIONS IN PROGRESS, THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF WHICH COULD BE DECIDED IN ADVANCE. CLEARLY A PROLONGED INTERRUPTION OF THE SERVICES OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES 
TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS WOULD BE UNDESRIREABLE. THE DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY SO DEEPLY AFFECTS ITS WELLBEING 
AND HAPPINESS AS TO RULE DUT ANY HOPE OF PERMANNENT PEACE IN IRELAND UNLESS OPPORTUNITIES AND PROCEDURES ARE OPEN WHICH CAN LEAD TO IRISH UNITY. THE NEW POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD BE SET IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN ULTIMATELY 
UNITED IRELAND 
AND THEY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO ENABLE CUMULATIVE PROGRESS TO BE MADE, BY AGREEMENT, IN THAT DIRECTION. TIME IS SHORT AND THE WAY SHOULD PROMPTLY BE CLEARED FOR THE 
POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WHICH ARE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO A WORSENING OF CIVIL CONFLICT AND ECONOMIC DISTRESS. AS A NECESSARY PRELIMINARY OBVIOUS BARRIERS WOULD HAVE TO BE LOWERED. THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ADND THE TIME HAS COME TO DISCHARGE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. 
(IV) INTERNMENT. 
INTERNMENT IS THE KEY AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THEMSELVES REALISTICALLY TO THE MATTER. FURTHERMORE, 
BRITISH ARMY MUST CEASE THEIR AGGRESSIVE ACTIVITIES IN DENSELY POPULATED CATHOLIC AREAS.

TO IMMEDIATE HOME OFFICE TELNO 019 OF 17 FEBRUAY FOLLOWINGIN PERSONAL FOR WOODFIELD. MY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TELEGRAM. 
SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES (JOINT ARMY/RUC PAPER FOR CONSIDERATION BY JSC) INTRODUCTION 1. IN VIEW OF SPECULATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING THE INTERNMENT PROCESS AS PART OF A POLITICAL REQUIREMENT, THERE IS A NEED TO SET OUT THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF A RELEASE OF INTERNEES, OTHER THAN THROUGH THE EXISTING MACHINERY. SECURITY IMPLICATIONS 2. ALL THE INTERNEES ARE MEMBERS OF THE IRA: CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO POOL OF INTERNEES WHO ARE MERELY POLITICAL ACTIVISTS. THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK THAT ANY INTERNEE RELEASED AS A POLITICAL GESTURE WILL RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND, REPAIRING THE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE WHICH HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON BOTH FACTIONS OF THE IRA SINCE 9 AUG 71. 3. THE PRIME TARGETS FOR RETALIATORY ACTION BY INTERNEES AFTER RELEASE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY THE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH OF THE PUC: THESE ARE FOR THE MOST PART KNOWN TO THOSE INTERNES WHOM THEY HAVE ARRESTED OR INTERROGATED. INTHE PAST THE RISK TO SPECIAL BRANCH HAS BEEN REDUCED BY REQUIRING RELEASED INTERNEES TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO A FORM OF OATH, AFFIRMATION OR UNDERTAKING TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL FORMS OF MILITANT ACTIVITY. SOME SIMILAR UNDERTAKING IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANY FUTURE RELEASES. 4. IN ANY PROGRAMME OF RELEASE FOR POLITICAL REASONS THE IRA WILL CERTAINLY REGARD THE MEASURE AS PROOF OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS. IT MAY ALSO BE SO REGARDED BY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE EFFECT OF THESE TWO FACTORS COULD WELL BE TO INCREASE IRA RESISTANCE TO INTERROGATION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO WEAKEN THE DETERMINATION OF MEMBERS OF THE BRANCH TO PURSUE INTERROGATION TO SUCCESS. IT COULD ALSO SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE RECRUITMENT AND RUNNING OF AGENTS. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE, THEREFORE, THAT INTELLIGENCE PROCUREMENT WILL SUFFER. 5. ANY ATTEMPT TO LINK A PROGRAMME OF RELEASES WITH AN UNDERTAKING NOT TO MAKE FURTHER ARRESTS WOULD BE REGARDED BY THE IRA AS A STILL GREATER SUCCESS AND THEY MUST BE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOUP THEIR LOSSES AND TO EQUIP THEMSELVES TO INTENSIFY OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE AT A DATE OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING. TO RESTRICT ARRESTS FOR DETENTION TO LEADING IRA MEMBERS ONLY MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES ALREADY DOMINATE THE TWO IRA FACTIONS BUT SUCH A DECISION WOULD INHIBIT SECURITY FORCE ACTION IN AREAS WHERE THE IRA IS STILL OPERATING EFFECTIVELY. EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO 9 AUG 71 MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT POLICE QUESTIONING WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF DETENTION OF INTERNMENT IS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AS AN INTELLIGENCE WEAPON IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THOSE ARRESTED HAVE BEEN WELL BRIEFED ON THEIR RIGHTS. IRA RECRUITING WILL BENEFIT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RELUCTANCE TO JOIN OF THOSE WHO FEAR INTERNMENT IS OVERCOME, AND THOSE ON THE RUN WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO RETURN: THERE ARE ABOUT 140 SUCH PEOPLE OPERATING FROM SOUTH OF THE BODER. 6. THE SEGREGATION AND REHABILITATION OF SELECTED INTERNEES AS A PRELIMINARY TO THEIR RELEASE CAN HOWEVER BE TAKEN WITHOUT THESE DISADVANTAGES. 7. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT, IN SPITE OF CAREFUL EXAMINATION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN PRESENT CONDITIONS (EG INTIMIDATION) TO BRING PRESENT INTERNEES TO TRIAL. CONCLUSIONS 8. ALL INTERNEES ARE MEMBERS OF THE IRA AND THEIR PREMAT

17 FEBRUARY 
1. MY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING TELEGRAM CONTAINS THE TEXT OF A PAPER ON THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES TABLED AT THE JOINT SECURITY COMMITTEE MEETING THISMORNING. DISCUSSION WAS BRIEF. GENERAL TUZO SAID THAT THE PAPER SIMPLY REPRESENTED THE VIEWS OF THE ARMY AND THE RUC ON THE SECURITY ASPECT. HE RECOGNISED THAT ITS ARGUMENT HAD TO BE BALANCED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT SOME RELEASE OF INTERNEES MIGHT HELP TO ATTRACT CATHOLIC OPINION AWAY FROM THE IRA. THE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND THE HEAD OF SPECIAL BRANCH EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMING AND OF NOT DOING ANYTHING TO RAISE THE MORALE OF THE INTERNEES. MR FAULKNER REFERRED TO THE BELIEF IN CATHOLIC CIRCLES (INCLUDING CATHOLIC MEMBERS OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY WHO HAD SEEN HIM) THAT SOME OF THOSE INTERNED WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE IRA, A BELIEF WHICH WAS CONTRADICTED BY PARA. 2 OF THE PAPER. HE WONDERED WHETHER IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO DEVISE A PROGRAMME FOR RELEASE OF INTERNEES WHICH COULD BE STARTED ONCE VIOLENCE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL. I DID NOT OFFER ANY COMMENT ON THE PAPER. THE MEETING TOOK NOTE OF IT. 2. MY VIEW IS THAT THE PAPER SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT TO THE JSC AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NOT TO PRODUCE A PAPER JOINTLY WITH THE RUC. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ARMY ARE WELL ENOUGH AWARE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH AND OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THEM TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THEIR INTEREST TO WHITEHALL WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES WITH SPECIAL BRANCH POSITIONS IN A JOINT PAPER. 3. THE DISCUSSION IN JSC MOVED ON TO A SUGGESTION BY BLOOMFIELD THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC STATEMENT WHICH WOULD BE DESIGNED TO CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT INTERNMENT EG THE LEGAL BASIS FOR IT AND THE RIGHT OF INTERNEES TO SECURE LEGAL ADVICE IN PRESENTING THEMSELVES TO JUDGE BROWN’S COMMITTEE. IT APPEARED TO BE THE THOUGHT OF SOME PRESENT AT THE MEETING THAT SUCH A PAPER WOULD ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT ONLY IRA MEMBERS WERE INTERNED. MR FAULKNER SAID THAT HE WAS SURE THAT UK MINISTERS WOULD LIKE SOMETHING TO BE PUT OUT. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE STATEMENT SHOULD ISSUE FROM THE JSC, AND ASKED THAT A DRAFT SHOULD BE READY WITHIN 48 HOURS. I QUESTIONED WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH A STATEMENT TO ISSUE FROM THE JSC AND SAID THAT IN THAT CASE I WOULD HAVE TO ASK FOR TIME TO REFER IT TO LONDON. MR FAULKNER SAID THAT SINCE THAT WOULD CAUSE DELAY HE WOULD DROP HIS SUGGESTION THAT IT SHOULD BE A JSC STATEMENT. 4. AFTER THE MEETING I SPOKE TO BLOOMFIELD AND POINTED OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE STATEMENT ISSUED FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT THE SUBJECT OF INTERNMENT WAS SO SENSITIVE THAT QUESTIONS MIGHT WELL BE DIRECTED TO HMG IN PARLIAMENT, ESPECIALLY IF THE STATEMENT DEALT WITH MATTERS SUCH AS THE IRA STATUS OF ALL INTERNEES AND THE OPERATION OF JUDGE BROWN’S COMMITTEE. HE READILY TOOK THE POINT THAT THE DRAFTING WOULD NEED TO BE DONE CAREFULLY. 5. SEE M.I.F.\T. SMITH

8. ALL INTERNEES ARE MEMBERS OF THE IRA AND THEIR PREMATURE RELEASE AS A POLITICAL GESTURE WOULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE GENERAL SECURITY SITUATION, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF INTELLIGENCE, VITAL IN ANY COUNTER-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN. 9. THE SEGREGATION OF INTERNEES COUPLED WITH A REHABILITATION PROGRAMME, AND PERHAPS A MORE ACCEPTABLE UNDERTAKING ON RELEASE SHOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASED FLOW OF INTERNEES BEING RELEASED THROUGH THE EXISTING MACHINERY OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL (JUDGE BROWN). AT THE SAME TIME, PROGRESS IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE IRA IS LEADING TO A GRADUAL DECREASE IN THE NUMBERS BEING INTERNED, AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER BEING CHARGED. THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE RELEASES EXCEED ADMISSIONS AND THE TOTAL INTERNMENT POPULATION STARTS TO DROP. RECOMMENDATION 10. THE JOINT SECURITY COMMITTEE IS INVITED TO TAKE NOTE. ENDS. SMITH

6. There was one explosion in Belfast during the period. When 
he night ferry from Heysham was about to dock in Belfast in the morning, a 40 lb gelignite bomb with a timing device was found in a suitcase on the deck, over some cabins which had been used by Service families. 7, 
Another attempt to steal a firearm from the home of an UDR 
member was toiled. Five armed men tried to enter the home of a member of 8 UDR, between Cookstown and Dungannon, but he refused to open the door to them and telephoned for help. A military patrol arrived but the gunmen had by then escaped. 8. 
At Magilligan Camp five internees tried to escape, four of them 
managing to reach the inner perimeter area. The prison staff were able to recapture all of them without assistance from the military guard. Some of the internees sustained injuries, and a prison officer is believed to have had his arm broken: a doctor was called to examine the injuries. Court hearing at Dundalk 9. 
There is full Press coverage for the fact that, when Meehan 
and Docherty and their five fellow Provisionals appeared again yesterday before the District Justice at Dundalk, all the charges against them alleging unlawful possession of firearms were dismissed. This is perhaps the most blatant example yet of the reluctance of the courts of the Republic to risk a collision with the IRA.

You mentioned to me that the Prime Minister wished to 
classification of all the internees into three categories. Those in the category Of least danger- which contains roughly 
25 percent (or 150) of the present internees - are mostly those who actually throw the bombs and fire the rifles. They 
are all IRA men; and their release carries the risk that they would go straight back to their previous activities, with an 
detention. 
obviously with some reluctance - that all the people in this category of least danger could be progressively released if political considerations ade this desirable 
Nevertheless the Army would accept in principle - 
that the political initiative was not followed by a major set back, (It would be greatly preferable to wait until those in the category of least danger had been physically separated from the others, and had experienced at least a short period away from the hardore category, before starting to release them). 
- and provided 
As regards new internments, we would be totally opposed to calling a complete halt, while being prepared to see greater 
selectivity. We quite apreciate that the political impact 
would be greater if it could be announced that, along with accelerating the release of those already interned, there would be no further internment orders: but there are important security reasons for not doing this. The morale and operational effectiveness of the IRA, and hence their level of intimidation, 
would inevitably rise the moment they knew that arrests under the Special Powers Act had stopped. It has to be remembered that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast, 
to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged. 
in mopping up known IRA member, has not so far been matched in other parts of the Province. In Belfast the build-up of intelligence, as a result of internment, has enabled this process

limit future new internments selectively to ring leaders of whom a number of the most important are still at large, But the Army consider it vital that the option should remain of detaining and interning terrorists who are captured in the rural areas, where the intelligence picture is less complete and the IRA may well build up their activities. 
Further, the Army’s willingness to see a larger 
number of the present internees released rests on the assumption that it will still be possible to re-arrest any who are found to be engaging in violence again. If that power no longer exists, the situation even in Belfast could quickly deteriorate again as those who are released come back into circulation. It will be necessary to keep a very close watch on whether the first releases are followed by any significant move towards reprisals against the Security Forces, especially the RUC Special Branch and the rest of the intelligence community, who will be extremely vulnerable at that stage. There should be no relaxation of the present requirement that before an internee can be released he must first sign an undertaking not to engage in unlawful activity (though the form of the present oath or affirmation may need to be modified). 
The Army hope that those internees who are released 
can be made subject to some form of licence or probation we understand that the legal means may exist to do this. But whether or not that practice is adopted, we consider it essential 
- at least for the first few months - to 
have the sanction of re-arrest and re-internment available. The Northern Ireland Government will, of course, 
have views about all this and we must expect them to be much influenced by the attitude of the RUC Special Branch which we know to be strongly opposed to a release rate which is more than marginally faster than is now being achieved. The matter is due to be discussed at the next meeting of the Joint Security Committee on 17th February and I will let you know the outcome of that meeting as soon as possible, That said, however, it is difficult to see how any policy less forthcoming than the one I have outlined above could make much of a contribution towards a successful political package.

16 February, 1972 As you know, the Embassy in Dublin is still 
having to improvise. We have received a letter from Sir John Peck dated 14 February containing a number of points which might, in easier circumstances, have been sent by telegram and received a wider distribution. It seems worth recapitulating these. 
SDLP Talks "Talks between the Irish Government and the 
SDLP went badly and there was no meeting of minds. The Irish Government would, I think, almost certainly settle or a coalition Government in Stormont including non-Unionists, 
and talks about phasing out internment. They regard Fitt’s ’no talks until internment ends’ as unrealistic, and believe that the SDLP would no longer accept a Stormont Government but will insist upon rule by commission. 
Reunification "Reunification has only come to the fore because 
every other road ahead seems to be blocked, and the Irish Government would certainly not regard it as a live issue. 
Political Initiative "It is universally assumed that The Sunday Times 
publicity about the ’political initiative’ was an inspired leak and there is something in the wind. As a result of Londonderry and the burning of the Embassy, Jack Lynch, contrary to hopes and expectations, is likely to have a very rough time at the party conference which starts on Friday, 18 February. He will do his best to damp down the post-Derry fury and endeavour to be constructive. If there were any pointer that he could be given to our thinking on the North it is important that he should have it, and before Friday. I have made it clear that in my opinion it seemed unlikely that we should have anything, but please note that the bid is there.

minority" will still not be able to make its voice effectively heard in the forum in which political decisions are made. Either this will have to be tolerated and defended on the ground that one cannot reasonably be expected to do more than give the minority their proportionate share in executive Government; or there will have to be machinery whereby certain decisions of Government require more than a simple majority. 
Responsibility for law and order 7. 
The plan is to take from Stormont the law and order powers and to 
be ready to give some of them back if circumstances should make it appropriate. One question that arises is whether a definition of the functions of law and order by reference to particular topics (see paragraphs 13 and 14) will quite do the trick. Does it, for example, cover the responsibility for legislating on the criminal law? (At some stage we shall need the comments of the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General). Internment 8. 
The phasing out of internment will be a tricky business - although the 
supplementary note by the Home Office suggests that it should be manageable if we can make even more prison staff available. It will also be the principal item of bait with which to lure the minorities and Mr. Lynch. Should it be an explicitly conditional element in the package 
- i.e. conditional on the rest 
of the package being accepted? Tactics and Procedure 
Proposals or Intentions ? 9. 
The first question is whether the project is to be put forward as a 
proposal for discussion or as a definite plan which we have decided to put into operation. It seems hardly conceivable that more formal discussion of the plan would produce agreement; and, although the Home Secretary has said that so long as we have reasonable and honourable propositions to make we can defend our position.against criticism here and abroad, this does not constitute any advance towards solving the problem of Northern Ireland. If we are to wait until we can secure an agreed plan, that problem may never be solved. We should, of course, be equally criticised if we went forward without agreement. But this should not be too damaging if we had undertaken adequate private consultation in advance and had shown ourselves willing to modify the detail of the plan where appropriate.

February 14 1972. My dear Prime Minister, 
hesitant in taking up any of your time but hope you will not mind my sending you these points on Ireland in view of our conversation of a few weeks ago. I know that you will be receiving advice from any sources, such of it better informed than mine, but hope this may be of some small help. 
Knowing how many problem you are dealing with I as 
1) Although londonderry has made the situation much more difficult I believe that the principal point which emerged from our discussion, namely that the Catholic minority is not irremediably alienated from the United Kingdom connection remains valid. Policy can thus continue to be based on the two bases : 
1. No separation from the U.K. without the consent of the sajority. 2. A new deal for the minority by offering full participation in the life of the province, both political and economic. 
2) Even if any new offer fails, it will have been worth doing, as opinion both at home and overseas requires or expects the government to take an initiative. This is not the situation "something must be done" which usually means that the wrong thing is done if the mood is heeded, but one where there is recognition that responsibility and power lies with the U.K. government. 
The government here will be in a stronger position 
in relation to N.I. if a reasonable offer is made and rejected, and not in a weaker one. 
3) I believe that talks with the Opposition in this situation are very worthwhile. They will spread the responsibility. Furthermore it is in the government’s interest to preserve the bi-partisan policy much more of which remaind in existene than the press allows. Its notable that Harold Wilson has not pressed for the end of internment immediately. Labour has it own difficulties over N.I. since the left wing while hating Ulster Unionists also detests the Catholic Church. 
A final point is 
that the government will look silly if while exhorting the Catholic parties in N.I. to come together it cannot itself talk to the Opposition. I quite agree in principle about the Privy Council limitation but one could get the same safeguard by confining talks to front-benchers e.g. Merlyn Bees instead of Kevin Macamara, or deputing certain security matters to privy councillors. 
4) Over the last few days and the weekend I have been taking soundings in Northern Ireland re the position of the Opposition parties, the Civil Rights Movement, and the I.R.A. The fo lowing picture emerges of their wishes : 1. They want the end of imprisonment without trial. I take this to mean that they do not want immediate release of all internees but want them to be brought to trial. 2. 3. 
They want Stormont to be suspended. 
to govern 4. 
5. 
They would like to see a commission appointed acceptable to the minority the province in the interim. 
They would like what they call "a count down" for a United Ireland. They would like quadripartite talks between the S.D.L.P. /the Ulster 
Unionists / the Irish Republic / the United Kingdom under a neutral chairman such as a European lawyer.

I realise that these "demands" as they stand are not acceptable but something could be done on each of them to provide a basis for a move 
5) My judgment is that in the present sitution it is necessary to offer a fairly radical package to secure a Catholic response. It is preferable to err in the Catholic direction rather than in the Protestant one. The Protestants after all have nowhere else to go. 
6) I would think it desirable to do the following : 1. Modify internment by scaling down and bringing trials : separating sheep and goats. 2. Transferring security to London. 3. Offer a for of community government within Stormont by offering the Catholics participation at every level including the //////////// cabinet. 4. On the other hand reassure the Protestants about the border by providing for an alteration only by referendum. 
7) The creation of a separate Northern Ireland Ministry is obviously a difficult and delicate question. There would be a danger if it was set up of it being isolated from the ordinary machinery of government and therefore ineffective. Nevertheless I think there is a strong case for some form of concentration. Some mind should be concentrating wholetime on the problems. 
6) Great patience is needed in trying to understand the Irish viewpoints. There is a danger of losing one’s temper and becoming exasperated with both sides ( at least this is what I have found.) One has to remember effectively all the time that the Irish are not English (unfortunately). 
9) There is a propaganda war going on which we have to win. We have to try and influence first British opinion, then opinion in Northern Ireland, then in the Republic, and finally in the rest of the world. This requires an major operation. World opinion has now become much more important than it was some weeks ago. 
10) It may well be that Northern Ireland is ungovernable and there is no possibility of an opening yet. Perhaps there has to be further bloodshed and exhaustion before a settlement can be reached. 
One has to recognise 
this even if one is not acting upon it. In other words I believe that the risk of failure in any initiative is very high, but it is a risk which has to be taken. 
from the Church authorities I would be most happy to do what I can both with Cardinal Conway and Cardinal Heenan, and with Protestant leaders. All good luck in this most difficult of tasks, 
sincerely yours, A If I can be of any help in securing support for proposals P.S. I have sent a copy of this letter to Donald Maitland.

NORTHERN IRELAND PART I : THE PLAN 
1 . A new policy for Northern Ireland might be made up of the 
following elements:periodic referenda; 
changes in the size, composition and method of election to the Northern Ireland Parliament, on the lines proposed in the Northern Ireland Government’s Green Paper; 
provision for community government; 
possible changes in responsibility for law and order, including a move towards running down internment. 
PERIODIC REFERENDA 2. 
The object is (a) to reassure Protestant opinion and (b) to 
attempt to remove the border as an issue from the ordinary government and administration of the province. 
The following scheme is 
proposed: (i) Repeal of the provision in the Ireland Act 19`9 that Northern Ireland or any part of it will not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. 
(ii) A new provision providing for the consent of a referendum in place of the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament. (The question would be raised whether local boundary adjustments could be made with a local poll only; this seems to us an unlikely starter.) 
(iii) The question to be put in the referendum might be: "Are you in favour of Northern Ireland leaving the United Kingdom?"

10. The scheme proposed is as follows (the terms ’Government party’ and’opposition party’ are used for convenience, although the expressions ’majority party’ and ’minority parties’ might be more accurate): (i) Every opposition party numbering 4 or more would be entitled to have one minister for the first 4, and another for every subsequent 7 members of that party. At least one half of these ministers would have appointments as heads of departments of the Government. 
(ii) The remaining ministers, apart from the Prime Minister himself, would not exceed 1 for the first 4 and 1 for every subsequent 7 members of the government party or parties. 
These ministers would probably, but not necessarily, be government men. 
(iii) The Prime Minister would not be obliged to go on offering ministerial posts to the members of an Opposition party after refusals from two members of the party. 
(iv) No party would be recognized as such unless it was in existence at the beginning of the Parliament or had subsequently been in existence for six months. 
Any 
question arising would be determined by the Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons. 
LAW AND ORDER. INCLUDING INTERNMENT 11. In times of tranquillity, there are clear advantages in a large measure of local responsibility for law and order. 
If community 
government works, and passions are cooled, there is much to be said for substantially maintaining the present system, perhaps (in respect of the police) with a strengthened Police Authority.

12. The possibility has to be faced however that at present it might well be found that no member of a community government would be able to discharge responsibility for law and order with the consent of his colleagues and of the population at large, and it would seem necessary to be prepared to make other arrangements, with the hope that the need for them would be temporary. 13. The main law and order functions are police; prisons (including internment camps); the functions of the Attorney-General in relation to prosecutions; judicial appointments; and the exercise for so long as necessary of the Special Powers Act. If there were a decision to transfer to Westminster, these functions would be provided for specifically, and in addition power should be taken to transfer the various minor matters in connexion with law and order, but for use only if experience showed it to be necessary. 14. 
(i) As regards police, the police authority would be retained, but the powers of the Minister for Home Affairs exercised by the Home Secretary. 
These 
powers are more extensive than those he has in relation to provincial forces in England and Wales (e.g. in relation to appointments and discipline) but less than those which he has in relation to the Metropolitan Police. 
(ii) The main prison in Northern Ireland, Crumlin Road gaol, does not at present hold any internees and the treatment of ordinary prisoners is not a contentious matter. 
But the internment camps are run by the 
Northern Ireland prison service and the Ministry of Home Affairs, and it would not seem possible to deal with them separately from the ordinary prisons.

15. The suggestion was made at the Ministers’ meeting on 9th February that one possibility might be to entrust law and order to a Governor having effective executive powers; he would be responsible to the United Kingdom Government, but the control would remain a local one. 
The main difficulty is that it seems 
unacceptable that, at any rate for more than a very brief period, responsibility for the main functions involved - control of the police, running the prisons, operating internment policy, all of which raise issues as to the rights and liberty of the subject should be exercised without there being ultimate responsibility to a democratically elected body; and responsibility to the United Kingdom Government would probably in the end turn out to be not very much different than if there were a direct transfer to Westminster. Concern with the police also involves close relationships with the Army, and the position could become extraordinarily complicated if there were a surviving Stormont Government; a separate Northern Ireland arm which took responsibility for (among other things) the police; and the continuing responsibility of the GOC for security matters. 
The arrangement would also look too much like a Colonial 
set-up. 16. In any fresh plan for Northern Ireland, proposals for changes in internment policy are clearly of the first importance, and would be crucial to the reaction of others to the plan. 17. It is difficult to be sure what scope there is for running down internment since our knowledge of the case against individuals is limited. 
The Home Office are reviewing internment in detail at a 
conference on 11th February with the Ministry of Defence, to be attended by the Chief of Staff and the Director of Intelligence, HQ Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom Representative in Belfast;

and by the time this paper is considered it should be possible to report further on the prospects of differentiating between the less and the more dangerous of the internees. 18. The present Advisory Committee under Judge Brown have asked to be relieved of their duties by the end of March so that they can resume their ordinary callings. 
A new Committee, perhaps 
headed by a more weighty figure than a Northern Ireland county court judge, could be appointed sooner than the end of March and given a directive that the policy was to run down internment and that they were required to reduce the numbers, if necessary by specified amounts over stated periods, selecting so far as possible the less dangerous for release. 19. 
As a corollary to a run-down in the numbers at present 
interned, it would be sensible to have some limitation on, if not a complete suspension of, further arrests under the Special Powers Act. 
This could perhaps be coupled with more concentration on cases where a prosecution could be mounted.

There were twelve arrests of wanted persons. 
Planned march in Enniskillen on 13 February 10. NICRA are due to stage a further illegal march against internment, in Enniskillen this Sunday. The town is 55 percent Protestant and the march is not expected to attract a crowd of more than 1,000 or 1,500. There may be the odd bus-load of supporters from Belfast, but there is no indication that residents of the Republic are expected to turn up. The date clashes with the NICRA annual general meeting in Belfast (and also with a rally which the IRA are apparently intending to stage outside the Dublin post office, with Cahill and Francis McGuigan - 
who escaped from Long Kesh earlier this week - as the 
speakers). 11. The main speakers at Enniskillen are expected to be Miss Devlin, Mr. McManus (whose constituency it is in), Kevin McCorry and Kevin Agnew. 12. The plane of the security forces are on the same line as those used for Newry last Sunday, namely an outer ring of vehicle check points and an inner ring of barriers to prevent marchers from reaching the centre of the town. This latter task should be a fairly easy matter in Enniskillen, since the town centre is virtually an island among the lakes, which can only be reached by one of three bridges or causeways.

to take place early next week. It is understood that the Sunday 
Times also have copies of the twenty-one statements and there is therefore the possibility of their being built up into another Insight feature; but the fact that these allegations had been made, and were being investigated, has already been reported in the Guardian over a fortnight ago. 18. Cardinal Conway is reported in today’s Press to have released the text of a telegram which he has sent to Roman Catholic bishops in Australia, in which he states "impressive evidence indicates that physical assault of arrested and uncharged persons, especially during questioning, is continuing." This seems something of a prejudgement of the outcome of the very investigations for which he asked.

Wednesday 9 February 1972 NORTHERN IRELAND 
- SEEKING THE NEXT STEP by George Holt LPS Political Correspondent Authoritative sources in London gave no (repeat no) credence tonight 
Wednesday to a report accredited to the London Correspondent of the Washington Post and appearing today in the British newspaper, The Guardian, that the British Government has tentatively decided on a three-pronged plan to relieve the conflict in Northern Ireland. 
The Washington Post’s correspondent’s story indicated that there were 
three key elements in such a plan: a) A relaxation of the internment policy b) Massive economic aid to reduce unemployment c) Some form of community government 
It added that best informed sources expected a favourable decision 
probably to be announced next week. This is not (repeat not) the position. 
The Government in London does 
indeed seek the earliest possible opportunity for a constructive initiative. It is undoubtedly true that Ministers have been giving the most urgent consideration to the Northern Ireland situation in the light of what happened recently both in Londonderry and in Newry. (repeat not) yet led them to basic decisions. 
on the first major question to be answered - namely, whether the present situation does indeed provide the opportunity for initiative. 
But their deliberations have not They have yet to make judgment 
Nor have they 
yet taken decisions on the shape of any initiatives, for the right moment whenever finally they may judge that to be. This is, moreover, a situation which might yet continue for some time. 
Meanwhile, as Ministers pursue this extremely difficult process of 
assessing the situation it is the merest speculation to indulge in discussion of the steps which might eventually be taken. It is also clear in London tonight that British Ministers are anxious that 
when any initiative is possible it will be launched in an atmosphere and at a time which augurs adequate response from all the parties involved. 
In this 
respect the Government has for long been mindful of the failure of previous initiatives because of this lack of response. 
One has in mind the Northern 
Ireland Government’s Consultative Document on the Future Development of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland, which it published last October and on which it has been impossible to get proper discussion in the light of the situation which has since existed.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 73 9 
FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours By recent standards there were not a great many incidents. There 
were a dozen shooting incidents altogether, including eight in Belfast. In one of these, a man named Bernard Rice - a member of the Catholic Ex-Servicemen’s Association 
- was shot dead from a passing car. The 
reason for this murder is not at present clear; speculation ranges from Protestant backlash to rivalry betwen the supporters of the Glaspow football teams, Celtic and Rangers (ice being a angers supporter). 2. 
There were three shooting incidents in Londonderry; and, in rural 
areas, patrols of UDR twice came under sire. There no casualties at all. 3. 
There were also about a dozen bombing incidents in all. 
Explosions caused major damage to a car salesroom in Belfast, a garage just outside Londonderry, the telephone exchange at Benburb, Co. Armagh and a bridge at Forkill. A vehicle was blown up in Newry; and near Portadown a fire burned down the garage of a Customs official. 4. 
Two soldiers sustained injuries in the Ardoyne when a claymore- 
type mine exploded. Other patrols in Belfast had blast-bombs thrown at them on two occasions, but no harm was done. 5. 
There were two minor finds of arms in the area of Armagh which 
included a rifle fond in the car park of a Catholic church. Disruption Day, 9 February 6. 
One cannot predict exactly what form the demonstrations will take 
to mark the expiry of six months since the introduction of internment. The likely possibilities are: a. 
Blocking of trunk roads and minor roads into Belfast; 
b. Picketing of police stations and Army posts;

You asked me :-

Philip Woodfield did see some of the statements which were prepared in the early stages in early September when he want to Northern Ireland on a visit. 
there is no regular arrangement whereby the UK Goverment is given this information. 
On (ii) there are two aspects :- 
(a) Mr. Faulkner’s criteria for signing an internment order; 
(b) Judge Brown’s criteria for release. 
These were announced in Mr. Faulkner’s statement on l5 September when he made the first 219 internment orders. 
The passage dealing with (a) is as follows :- 
"I have made no interment order without being satisfied on evidence placed before me that the person concerned was and still is an active member of the official or provisional ting of the IRA or has been closely implicated in the recent IRA campaign." 
The passage relevant to (b) is as follows :- 
"The Special Powers Regulations provide for the setting up of an Advisory Committee to consider representations from internees. 
His Honour 
Judge Brown nas agreed to act as Chairman of this Committee 
............ The Committee’s 
main function will be to assess whether or when the internee’s release can be safely permitted and, where appropriate, the Committee will consider whether or not they can accept any undertaking on his part that he will not engage in violence on his release."

Northern Ireland: Statement by the Home Secretary The Home Secretary does not say when or in what circumstances he 
proposes to make his statement and this is one of the issues which will have to be considered. But the/question for consideration is whether the policy implicit in the statement would command the support of the Cabinet and stand a reasonable chance of acceptance in Northern Ireland. 2. 
propositions:(a) Periodical plebiscites on the Border, the first being held at the 
outset, the second 15 years later and others at successive ten-yearly intervals. (b) The reform of the Northern Ireland Parliament, probably on a 
PR basis. (c) A guarantee of minority representation in the central Government, 
local government and all the organs of administration. The Home Secretary seems 
representation would be on a proportionate basis. (d) 
- though this is not entirely clear - to envisage that Responsibility for law and order to remain vested in "the elected 
authorities in the area subject to the overruling authority of HMG". This is not entirely clear and is in any case not wholly accurate. There is no question of any "overruling authority of HMG" in Great Britain 
The essence of the proposed policy seems to consist of the following - except in 
so far as the Exchequer finances police authorities in part and the central Government have power to make general regulations. The point is of some importance since, if the Home Secretary is thinking in terms of some overriding executive authority by Westminster, he cannot argue that this would follow normal practice in Great Britain; it would in fact be exceptional. (e) A period of transition before the new arrangements in (b)-(d) 
above come into force. During this period the administration of the Province would be vested in "a Commission responsible to the Government at Westminster". (d) A modification of internment in order that it may be progressively 
phased out.

8. There were three arrests of wanted persons. Shortly after midday 
it was discovered that an internee was missing from Long Kesh Camp: he is Francis McGuigan, formerly an officer on the staff of the Belfast brigade of the Provisional IRA. The indications are that he escaped in the company of some visitors to the camp, possibly a group of priests. At 6.30 p.m. another internee was found hiding in a laundry basket which was awaiting collection. IRA in the Republic 9.

Northern Ireland After Ministers have discussed, this afternoon, the preparations 
for dealing with tomorrow’s "anniversary of internment" march, they should perhaps consider:(a) The plans for coping with the Civil Rights march due to take place at Enniskillen on Sunday, 13th February. 
(b) The lessons to be learned from Newry in respect of tactical dispositions against marchers. At Newry the security forces appear to hate been successful both in avoiding provocation and in diverting the march from its original objective in the centre of the town. But they also seem to have been taken by surprise by a well-concealed change of plan on the part of the marchers; and, although all ended peacefully, a repetition of this tactic on another occasion might not have an equally peaceful outcome. 
Is there room for improvement in our intelligence about the demonstrators’ intentions? 
(c) The public relations aspect of these occasions. At Newry the tactical success of the security forces was obscured by an impression that NICRA scored points by holding an illegal march despite the ban; by demonstrating alienation from Government policy in such strength that the security forces were powerless to intervene; and by conducting the proceedings in a peaceful and disciplined way. This was a very one-sided presentation of the matter; and it did less than justice to the Army and the RUC, who are entitled to claim that the victory lay with them. Not least for the sake of their morale but also in the interests of the Government’s policy, we should do better than this in future.

HQ NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING General 1. 
during and after the illegal NICRA march on Sunday 30 January and its repercussions throughout the Province. 
The week has been dominated by the events in Londonderry Those took the form 
of widespread demonstrations, protest meetings, token strikes and closures, and intimidation as well as an upsurge in violence, particularly in Belfast. 
It has boon most noticeable that those areas of Belfast where the IRA. have been hardest hit - Ardoyne, New Lodge, Markets and 
place in those areas whore the IRA still has considerable influence and the power to intimidate 
West Belfast. 3. 
Conversely, the vast majority has taken - the Falls, West and South 
2. 
East Belfast, have played very little part in the reactions to the Londonderry shootings. 
In the early part of the week terrorist attacks continued and of bombs in parked stolen cars, particularly in Belfast. 
Bomb attacks continued with increasing use being made One 
assassination attempts were made on police officers and UDR members as well as sniping and ambush attacks on security force patrols and posts. 
policeman and one soldier have been killed during the week while nin regular soldiers, a UDR sldier and three policemen were wounded. A number of civilians have also been injured by terrorist bombs and gunfire. Arrest operations have continued. 
NICRA March - Sunday 30 January 4. 
The illegal NICRA. march in Londonderry on Sunday 30 January followed the prediction made before the event. 
The organisers, 
intent on defying the ban, led the marchers into direct confrontation with the Security Forces and lost control of the hooligan element. Arrest squads of 1 PARA, which were sent in to arrest the rioters, came under attack from IRA gunmen and bombers. In the exchanges of fire 13 people were killed and 15 wounded, 5 soldiers received minor injuries. 
5. The whole incident is now sub judice pending the investigation 
by the Widgery Tribunal. Propaganda 6. 
amongst Catholics in the North as well as moderates in the Republic. There were signs that the Irish Government might be steeling itself to curb IRA activities, particularly in border areas. NICRA marches had been poorly attended. 
By mid-January 1972 the IRA was in danger of losing support Several It was therefore vital 
for the IRA that Irish emotions should be aroused and commonsense set aside, if their campaign to achieve a united Ireland by force was to succeed.

PORARILY RECALLED FROM HIS POST IN LONDON. 
IRISH GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED TO SHOW THAT THE IRISH ARE UNITED IN THEIR APPROACH TO THE CRITICAL SITUATION 
IN THE NORTH OF IRELAN AND THEY CONSIDER THAT IT NOW MUST BE CLEAR TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THAT BRITISH POLICIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND ARE MISGUIDED. 
THE IRISH GOVERNMENT CONSIDER THAT WHAT IS NOW REQUIRED ARE: (1) 
THE IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF BRITISH TROOPS FROM DERRY CITY AND CATHOLIC CENTRES ELSEWHERE AND THE CESSATION OF THE HARASSMENT OF THE MINORITY POPULATION IN THE NORTH OF IRELAND (WHICH AMOUNTS TO BETWEEN 35 TO 40% OF THE POPULATION OF THE NORTH) 
(2) THE END OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL: AND (3) A DECLARATION OF BRITISH INTENTION TO ACHIEVE A FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THE IRISH QUESTION AND THE CONVOCATION OF A CONFERENCE FOR THAT PURPOSE. 
THE IRISH GOVERNMENT ARE SATISFIED THAT NOTHING LESS CAN BRING ABOUT PEACE IN THE NORTH OF IRELAND AND THEY ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSALS OUTLINED ABOVE WILL PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE. 
THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WISH TO EMPHASISE THE EXTREMELY CRITICAL SITUATION THAT NOW EXISTS IN THE NORTH OF IRELAND AND TO EXPRESS THEIR GRAVEST ANXIETY ABOUT (A) THE REPRESSION OF THE MINORITY IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY AND (B) THE FAILURE ON BRITISH PART TO RECOGNISE THE NEED FOR AN IMMEDIATE POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED. 
THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA WOULD EXPRESS THEIR SYMPATHY TO THE PRESENT CRITICAL SITUATION AND WOULD HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA SHOULD APPROACH BRITISH AUTHORITIES TO RECOMMEND THE THREE FOLD REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND AS OUTLINED ABOVE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A PEACEFUL SOLUTION IN THE PRESENT SITUATION. 
THE IRISH GOVERNMENT HAVE ALSO INSTRUCTED THE IRISH EMBASSY AT LONDON TO INFORM THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT EXPECTS THEM TO TAKE THE MOST STRINGENT PRECAUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS PARADE TO TAKE PLACE IN NEWRY IN NORTH IRELAND ON SUNDAY NEXT THE 6 FEBRUARY DOES NOT BRING A RECURRENCE OF ANYTHING LIKE THE TRAGIC HAPP- 
ENiNGS IN DERRY ON SUNDAY LAST. IN THIS CONNECTION THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WOULD ASK THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT TO USE THEIR GOOD

NORTHERN IRELAND -THE 
SCHEDULES FOR 6 FEB 72 General 1. 
Background Area a. 
NEWRY has a population of 11,750, 70% Catholic. The 
NEWRY area is traditionally a very Republican area. The canal and river in the centre of the town is completely impassable except at the bridges. 
b. 2. The long range weather forecast is that the weather 
will be changeable with rain at times, high winds but temperatures normal for this time of the year. 
The Intelligence Assessment a. 
Previous marches in NEWRY, whether Catholic or Protestant sponsored, have always caused tension. 
b. In the context of the march on 6 February, with Catholic feelings running high on both sides of the border, there is likely to be a very large attendance, certainly numbered in thousands. Estimates quoted in the Irish Press indicate that 30,000 are expected; Bernadette DEVLIN has said that civilians would outnumber soldiers by 125 to 1; and on 3 February 1972 Dr O’CONNELL, a Labour member of the Dail, telephoned the Home Secretary to say that he had heard from a reliable IRA source that there were plans to launch 250,000 men across the border. We can be certain that many thousands will in the event march, whether from the South or from within NEWRY itself or other places in the Province, and late on 3 February 1972 there were still NO reports of bookings of coaches in DUBLIN or DUNDALK. But this negative information must be balanced against the fact that 
a firm decision to hold the march was only announced at about 1800 hours on 3 February. 
PROPOSED ILLEGAL MARCH IN NEWRY

Northern Ireland This morning’s Cabinet seemed to be moving towards agreement on 
four points:(a) The appointment of a separate Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. (b) A referendum on the Border. (c) A beginning of a phasing out of internment. (d) The transfer of law and order to Westminster. (a) was argued on merits; and it is probably true that it is something which could be done - and justified - regardless of whether there was a 
political initiative or not. But it is surely wrong to consider (b), (c) and (d) on the same plane 
i.e. as steps which should be taken irrespective of a political initiative. Thus, a referendum on the Border would be a "bonus" for the Protestants; and, as such, it should not be conceded except in return for an assurance of their co-operation in a programme of change designed to put them on equality with the rest of the United Kingdom of which they profess to wish to be an integral part. 
Similarly, a phasing out of internment would represent a 
major concession to the minority in the North and to Mr. Lynch in the South; and it is therefore essentially a bargaining card, which should not be played except in return for counter concessions in the wider political context. Rather different considerations apply to a transfer of law and order to 
Westminster. Even if it were reluctantly accepted by Mr. Faulkner, it would still leave responsibility awkwardly divided between Westminster and Stormont since, although Westminster would gain control of the security forces, Stormont would still retain such functions as housing, education, etc.; and it is these which are often the occasion for the grievances with which the security forces have to deal. And, if the transfer were not accepted by Mr. Faulkner, the progression to direct rule would be almost inevitable and very swift. Either way, therefore, the transfer of law and order alone is a half-way house, at which it would be difficult to stop for long.

For these reasons it may be wrong to suppose - as the Cabinet were inclined to suppose - that the Government couldor would be wise to confine 
action to the points listed above. Once one has embarked on a process of radical reform it acquires its own momentum,which it ought to be allowed to develop to the full. Is the next step some private discussion with Mr. Lynch in order to 
try to establish whether, in return for a concession on internment, he would be prepared to take stronger action in the South and so help us to build up the kind of political pressure which would compel Mr. Faulkner either to co-operate in the wholesale reform which the Home Secretary advocates or at least not to stand in its way?

(vi) A gradual phasing-out of internment (which would probably stop short of the hard core internees until it was reasonably clear that the IRA campaign was at an end), possibly coupled with the institution of some form of quasi-judicial procedure in special courts. 
(e) Are the Cabinet prepared to face the implications of so drastic an interim measure? Many of the consequences are unpredictable 
- not least 
the reaction of the Ulster Unionist Members at Westminster during the critical stages of the European Communities Bill. Moreover, direct rule is what the IRA have always wanted; and its introduction may therefore be claimed by them as a victory and may provide them with a fresh incentive to even greater intransigence and violence rather than to accommodation and compromise. All of this is speculation. What is certain is that legislation will be required; that, if there is local opposition, a short period of "Governor’s Rule" (based on the Governor’s powers under the 1920 Act), may be inevitable; and that in certain circumstances even this might need separate legislation of its own, of the one -clause-in-one -day variety. 
It is 
impossible to foresee whether opposition will in fact develop on a scale which would make action of this kind unavoidable. Mr. Faulkner’s own statements on the point are ambiguous. But the tone of his most recent letter, particularly its conclusion, is not encouraging; "Peterborough" in today’s Daily Telegraph reports that he is launching a world-wide publicity campaign "to put the record straight"; and there has been an oblique hint from Sir Harold Black that, if a solution is "imposed" on Stormont, he and his colleagues may rally behind Mr. Faulkner rather than behind Westminster. We may take all this with several grains of salt. But we should not ignore it; and we should be prepared to impose our will by force, if necessary, over a long period. The Cabinet should be under no illusion about what this would entail - in manpower, expenditure and political odium both at home and abroad. (f) 
Finally, if the Cabinet decide to endorse the Home Secretary’s 
proposals, are they content with the consequential timetable? The effective choice lies between completing the legislation before Easter or not introducing it until after Easter. The Ministerial group were inclined at their last meeting to favour the former course. If so, and if one makes allowance for the Budget in the week beginning 20 March, the Bill (or Bills) will have to clear the Commons within the next fortnight. And before then:(a) The Opposition must be brought into line, if possible. The Lord President has throughout emphasised the importance of establishing a bipartisan basis for whatever policy we adopt.

in it escaped. Two caches of arms were found in Belfast on Friday, totalling four firearms and 2300 rounds of ammunitions and some explosives material was found in Ballymurphy on Sunday. Possibilities of Protestant terrorism 9. 
Both wins ofthe IRA have denied responsibility for the 
Abercorn Restaurant explosion, and have sought to pin it on Protestant extremists. However, this may well be simply because they have realised how much revulsion it has caused. The RUC, who are fairly ell in touch with the plans of Protestant extremists, have no reason 
to suppose that this was their work; and it has the usual characteristics of an attack by the rovisionals. Some of the other events of the weekend are open to the suggestion that they were the ork of Protestants. The fatal shooting of a soldier in the Shankill on Friday is perplexing - 
although it is believed that the gunman 
made his escape by car, and might therefore have come from any where. Catholics were the victims of the explosion in Plevna Street on Saturday 
- but the bomb might for various reasons have been left in 
the deserted house by the IRA. The shots at Catholic youths on Sunday evening are not easily explained as IRA activity: there is little information about this incident on which to form a view either way. 
Political activity 10. The Ulster Vanguard held two rallies on saturday afternoon at Coleraine and Ballymeena 
- attracting rather over 2,000 people in 
the first case and about 1,600 in the second. Roth were uneventful. 11. On Sunday afternoon an attempt was made to stage an illegal march against internment from Pomeroy to Carrickmore. This one, unlike those of the past fortnight, apparently had the backing of NICRA and the SDLP collectively, as well as Miss Devlin personally. About 1,000 people had collected by the time the march approached Carrickmore, where it was halted by the police outside the town. Most of them then dispersed, but about 350 re-assembled on a disused railway line

THE FACT IS, AS INDICATED IN THE REPCRTS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TRIBUNALS OF CAMERON, HUNT AND COMPTON, AS WELL AS IN ThE WORKS OF MNY SERIOUS AUTHORS INCLUDING PROFESSOR RICHARD ROSE, THAT THE ORIGIN OF VIOLENCE IN THE NORTH LIES IN THE KIND OF TREATMENT METED OUT BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES TO A MINORITY OF UP TO 40% OF THE POPULATION EVER SINCE STORMONT WAS FOUNDED. THIS TREATMENT IS A COMPOUND OF POLICE VIOLENCE, DELIBERATE DISCRIMINATION, CONTEMPT FOR CULTURAL VALUES AND DEPRIVATION OF CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHT 
THE REVULSION OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY AGAINST SUCH TREATMENT HAS BEEN MET BY A PRETENCE AT REFORM TO FOOL THE UNWARY, BY MILITARY ACTIVITIES THAT INTIMIDATE THE MINORITY POPULATION AND NOW A HYSTERICAL ATTEMPT TO SHIFT ELSEWHERE THE BLAME FOR THE STORMONT REGIME’S POLITICAL BANKRUPTCY. 
REFORM. ON REFORM, THE POSITION IS THAT SOME PIECES OF LEGISLATION HAVE BEEN ENACTED MOST OF WHICH CHANGE NOTHING iMMEDIATELY AND SOME OF WHICH CANNOT SERICUSLY BE TAKEN TO HAVE ANY GENUINE INTENTION AT ALL OF CHANGING EXISTING CONDITIONS. SO MUCH HAS THE IDEA OF REFORM UNDER THE STORMONT REGIME BROKEN DOWN THAT IT MUST EE OBVIOUS TO EVERYCNE CONCERNED, INCLUDING THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THAT WHAT IS NEEDED IS EXCEPTIONAL AND RADICAL CHANGE OF POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES. NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH A CHANGE WILL PREVENT UNIONIST AUTHORITIES, AND CERTAINLY NOT LEGISLATION IMPLIMENTED BY THEMSELVES, FROM CONTINUING THEIR OLD METHODS OF DEPRIVING THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS OF A FAIR SHARE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AFFAIRS. 
INTERNMENT. MISGOVERNMENT REACHED A NEW PEAK IN THE NORTH WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL DIRECTED’SOLELY AGAINST THE MINORITY COMMUNITY. IN VERY MANY CASES - PROBABLY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES - THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MEN HAVE BEEN INTERNED WITHOUT TRIAL WHO HAD NO CONNECTION WITH VIOLENCE. THEY ARE KNOWN TO BE OUTSPOKENAND COURAGEOUS OPPONENTS OF UNIONISM AND HAVE BEEN INTERNED FOR THAT REASON. PHYSICAL AND MENTAL TORTURE, AS REVEALED LAST YEAR IN THE COMPTON REPORT AND YESTERDAY CONDEMNED AS MORALLY UNJUSTIFIABLE IN LORD GARDINER’S MINORITY REPORT FOR THE PARKER COMMISSION, HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST SOME OF THEM: BRUTALITY HAS BEEN EXERCISED FREELY AGAINST VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM AND HUNDREDS MORE SEIZED ON THE STREETS OR ’’LIFTED’’IN THEIR HOMES HAVE ALSO BEEN ILL-TREATED, ALTHOUGH NEITHER DETAINED NOR CHARGED WITH ANY OFFENCE. DETAILED INFORMATION HAS RECENTLY BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TENANTS ASSOCIATIONS IN DERRY ABOUT THE AGGRESSIVE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE TACTICS BEING USED BY THE BRITISH ARMY IN AND AROUND THEIR AREAS. CS GAS IS PUMPED INTO STREETS MOSTLY INHABITED BY ELDERLY PEOPLE: SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE TERRORISED ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL ALMOST EVERY DAY. SOLDIERS ACT UNCER ORDERS. THE QUESTION ARISES 
- WHOSE ORDERS? COMPLAINTS 
MADE ABOUT THESE THINGS ARE FILED AND THEN IGNORED. SUCH PROCEDURES CONTINUE DAILY IN THE NORTH IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FINAL, DESPERATE ATTEMPT BY THE STORMONT REGIME TO MAINTAIN ITS POWERS AND PRIVILEGES INDEFINITELY.

NEAR THE BORDER ARE CONCERNED, THESE REPRESENT AN INSIGNIFICANT 
PROPORTION OF WHAT HAPPENS EVERY 24-HOURS ELSEWHERE IN THE NORTH. IN SAYING THIS, I DO NOT INTEND FOR A MOMENT TO BE TAKEN TO CONDONE THEN. I HAVE, HOWEVER, ON SEVERLL OCCASIONS SUGGESTED TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THAT THEY AND WE SHOULD APPROACH THE UNITED NATICNS JOINTLY TO ASK FOR A UN OBSERVER GROUP ALONG THE BORDER. BRITAIN HAS TURNED DOWN THIS AS SHE HAS ALSO TURNED DOWN THE OFFER CF THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO MAKE HIS GOOD OFFICES AVAILABE. IT REMAINS A FACT, HOWEVER, THAT OF THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DETAINED, INTERNED WITHOUT TRIAL, OR CHARGED WITH POLITICAL OFFENCES WRING THE PAST THREE YEARS, HARDLY A HANDFUL OF THEM CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE SIX-COUNTY AREA. 
THE POLICIES FOLLOWED BY THE PRESENT STORMONT REGIME ARE CLEARLY DESIGED TO PUT DOWN THE WHOLE MINORITY POPULATION IN THE NAME OF ERADICATING COMPARATIVELY FEW MEN OF VIOLENCE. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY WHATEVER THAT SUCH POLICIES CAN SUCCEED. THE IRISH GOVERNMENT ARE NOT REPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE POLICIES. ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT THE BLAME OR TO INDUCE US TO REPEAT HERE THE MONUMENTAL AND TRAGIC BLUNDER OF ONE-SIDED INTERNMENT ARE FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THAT GOVERNMENT’S BANKRUPTCY IN REALISTIC POLICIES. 
IRA IN THE SOUTH SO FAR AS INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN THE TWENTY-SIX COUNTIES ARE CONCERNED, SUCH MEASURES AS ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE ARE TAKEN AS AND WHEN NECESSARY. ADVICE RECEIVED FRPM THE STORMONT REGIME IN SUCH MATTERS NEEDS ONLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE GRAVE DESTRUCTION OF SOCIETY WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE NORTH FROM POLICIES PURSUED THERE IN ORDER TO BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND. THE IRA ARE ENEMIES OF OUR STATE AND OF OUR INSTITITUONS AND SERIOUSLY DAMAGE AND DELAY THE PROSPECTS OF REAL IRISH 
PROSECUTIONS HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY BROUGHT SUBJECT TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW IN RESPECT OF ILLEGAL IRA ACTIVITIES, MANY OF THEM SUCCESSFULLY, IN RECENT YEARS. I REPUDIATE ANY SUGGESTION THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE ALDERSHOT OUTRAGE THAT RECENT LAW ENFORCEMENT DECISIONS WERE TAKEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WAS PURSUING CHARGES OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES AGAINST PERSONS WHO WERE DISCHARGED IN RECENT WEEKS BY THE DISTRICTEURT WAS MADE BEFORE, AND NOT BECAUSE OF, THE TRAGIC ALDERSHOT AFFAIR. 
POLITICAL INITIATIVES WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATINGG, INDEED EXPECTING A BRITISH POLITICAL INITIATIVE FOR A LONG TIME. WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH AN INITIATIVE IS IMMINENT. ANY DECISIONS NOW BEING MACE ANDUMEASURES TO BE ADOPTED IN RESPECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE NORTH SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONAL AND RADICAL. IF SUCH A CHANGE IS FORTHCOMING I HOPE THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH WILL, IN THE INTERESTS OF PEACE, AGREE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPERATION OF A NORTHERN ADMINISTRATION, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THEIR LEGITIMATE ASPIRATION OF IRISH UNITY, ACHIEVED BY AGREEMENT AND IN INDEPENDENCE.

IT WAS THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THEY COULD BE REALLY DEFEATED. HE COULD NOT MEASURE THE STOENGTH OF THE PROTESTANT EXTREMIST THREAT BUT HE FELT SURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF PROTESTANTS WOULD COOPERATE. IF HMG WERE TO ADOPT THE POLICY HE PROPOSED, HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT, IN PRESENTING IT, TO EMPHASISE THAT THE OVER-RIDING NEED FOR THE COUNTRY WAS A MASS-IVE EFFORT AT REHASILITATION AND TO ARGUE THAT THIS RADICAL POLITICAL STEP WAS THE ONLY 0AY OF COMPININ THE ENERGIES OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY TO AC" HIEVE THAT END IN AN ATMOSPHERE FREE FROM POLITICAL QUARRELLING AND THE DELAYS AND LACK OF PURPOSE WHICH CHARACTERISED THE PRESENT W;ORKING OF THE STORMONT PARLIAMENT. A. MORTON SAID THAT GIVEN THIS CHANGE OF POLICY THE CATHOLICS WHO HAD BEEN ON THE COMMISSION WOULD RETURN IMMEDIATELY. ALTHOUGH THEY ’1 THDREW IN PROTEST AGAINST INTERNMENT AND WOULD EXPECT SOMETHIr11G TO BE DONE ABOUT INTERNMENT, THEY WOULD NOT IMPOSE THE CONDITICN THAT IT MUST BE ENTIRELY ENDED BEFORE THEY WOULD COOPERATE. MOPTON ALSO SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THE DECISION TO WIND UP THE COMISSICH MIEN THE NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS CAME INTO FORCE HAD ITEN A GREAT MISTAKE. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE COMIISSION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT FUNCTIONS, RELIEVING IT OF ITS PPESENT NUNICIPAL FUNCTIONS, WHICH WOULD OF COURSE HAVE TO PASS TO THE NEW LOCAL AUTHORITY. 5. AS YOU KNOW MORTON IS A MAN OF MODERATE VIEWS, AT ONE TIME ONE OF THE BIGGEST ESTATE AGENTS HERE AND A FORMER UNIONIST COUNCILLOR ON THE BELFAST CORPORATION. S`ITH

the Government for inclusion. this fact. 
But one immediate proposal I would urge on And it starts from 
It is clear that no agreement will be 
possible unless the package includes measures for a progressive ending of internment, defined in terms of imprisonment without trial or preferred charges. Press reports indicate that this is bein considered by the Government, and that once the releases begin, their number and timing will depend upon the scaling down of violence. 
We can all understand the anxieties that the 
progressive closure of Long Kesh and Magilligan will create in the minds of all who fear an intensification of violence. 
this proposal: 
I want the Government, therefore, to consider They should announce their willingness 
to carry through a policy to end imprisonment without trial, by a phased programme of releases of every detainee and internee except those against whom criminal charges are preferred in the Courts. 
They 
should announce a date for this to begin, let us say, at some point early in April. 
They should further 
announce their willingness for all-party talks, on an open agenda, nothing barred that any of the parties wished to have discussed. 
This, I believe, would enable leaders of the 
minority community in Northern Ireland, political leaders, Church leaders, to use their influence throughout the community to produce an offer that, from the moment of the announcement, there would be an undertaking that violence would cease, for one month in the first instance. 
This would provide 
an assurance to those whose fears need to be stilled. At the end of that month, the all-party talks, on the open agenda basis, would begin.

3rd March, 1972. NORTHERN IRELAND: INTERNMENT Your letter of 29th February to Robert Andrew recorded 
the informal meeting which the Prime Minister had with the Defence Secretary and the CGS after GEN 47 on 28th February. There is one point in it on which you would probably like our comments - the extent to which the Army had information which would enable them to say with confidence that those interned were members of the IRA. 
The information on which recommendations for internment 
are made by the RUC Special Branch is naturally held by the Special Branch themselves. 
But a senior Army intelligence 
officer has always had complete access to these records; and he is satisfied that, subject to two reservations, virtually all the internees are IRA members. 
The first is that three 
of the internees cannot be assigned to specific appointments in the IRA’s order of battle, though the dossiers concerned show that the Special Branch regard two of them as members of the IRA and the third as having strong links with the IRA. The other reservation is that one cannot entirely rule out the possibility that in a few cases the information provided to the Special Branch might have been prompted by personal spite, 
or something similar, on the part of the informants. I am sending a copy of the letter to Brian Norbury.

’WHAT IF I WERE TO LISTEN NOW TO MR HUME AND HIS COLLEAGUES, 
AND EMPTY THE CAMPS TOMORROW? WHO CAN SERIOUSLY IMAGINE THAT IN THAT SITUATION THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO EXERT ANY INFLUENCE FOR PEACE? THEY WOULD BE SWEPT ASIDE BY THE TRIUMPHANT GUNMAN. 
’’LET US EXAMINE THIS BUSINESS OF INTERNMENT BEING A ’RECRUITING SERGEANT FOR THE IRA’. 
- IT’S A GOOD ROUND PHRASE, 
BUT IT HAS LITTLE FOUNDATION IN FACT. THE INTERROGATION OF PECPLE RECENTLY TAKEN INTO DETENTION SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT IT WAS THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY BEFORE INTERNMENT 
JUNE, JULY AND EARLY AUGUST - WHICH BROUGHT THE GREAT UPSURGE IN IRA STRENGTH. 
WE ARE TOLD, TOO, OF A COMPLETE ALIENATION OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT EASY FOR PEOPLE IN MANY AREAS TO EXPRESS PUBLICLY A CERTAIN VIEW, BUT I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT IN JUST SUCH AREAS MANY, MANY PEOPLE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE RID OF THE THUGS WHO HAVE FOR TOO LONG OPPRESSED THEM. 
’’YOU MAY ASK WHY IT IS, AS SO MANY OF THE IRA LEADERS ARE REMOVED FROM THE SCENE, THAT THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES? IT CCNTINUES - 
I BELIEVE - BECAUSE OF IRRESPONSIBLE SPECULATION, 
WHICH ENCOURAGES AMONGST THE DIMINISHING RANKS OF THE TERRORISTS THE IDEA THAT THEY ONLY HAVE TO KEEP IT UP A LITTLE LONGER AND RESISTANCE TO THEIR EFFORTS WILL CRUMBLE:- THAT THE INTERNEES WILL BE RELEASED: THAT STORMONT WILL BE ABOLISHED: THAT A UNITED IRELAND, ENGINEERED BY THEM AND DOMINATED BY THEM, WILL BE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. THAT IS WHY IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT 
- IN WHATEVER TALK THERE IS ABOUT 
POLITICAL MOVES - TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IN NO SENSE WILL THE IRA BE ALLOWED TO WIN. RESPONSIBLE POLITICAL INITIATIVES ARE OF NO INTEREST TO THE IRA:- WHAT THEY WANT IS SURRENDER. 
’’PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE THAT DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. 
’’A VICTORY FOR TERRORISM IN ANY PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WOULD BE A SIGNAL TO EVERY ANTI-DEMOCRATIC ELEMENT IN THE NATION THAT THE FABRIC OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY IS WIDE OPEN TO ATTACK. THE MAIN LINE OF BATTLE MAY, AT THE MOMENT, LIE THROUGH ULSTER, BUT IT IS TRULY A NATIONAL STRUGGLE AND THE WHOLE BRITISH PEOPLE MUST, IN A FULL REALISATION OF WHAT IS AT STAKE, BE DETERMINED TO WIN IT. AND IF THE IRA SEE THAT DETERMINATION - SEE IT MANIFEST IN PUBLIC OPINION, IN THE EXPRESSIONS OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, IN THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT 
- THEN THEY WILL COME QUICKLY TO THE REALISATION 
THAT IT IS POINTLESS TO CONTINUE. THEN, AND ONLY THEN, CAN MEASURES FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC BE RELAXED. 
’’IS IT, I WONDER, JUST POSSIBLE, THAT OUR NEIGHBOURS IN THE SOUTH 
- AS THEY GAZE AT THE EMPTY AND SILENT STANDS AT 
LANSDOWNE ROAD RUGBY STADIUM OR THE DESERTED HOTELS ONCE FULL OF BRITISH TOURISTS 
- MAY SEE AT LAST HOW THIS POISON INFECTS 
THEM? INDEED, THERE IS THE VERY SOURCE OF THE POISON ITSELF FOR IT IS IN THE SOUTH THAT THE WHOLE, ROMANTIC, VIOLENT, BLOOD-STAINED ’PHYSICAL FORCE’ TRADITION OF IRISH REPUBLICANISM HAS ITS HOME. TOO MANY OF THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE BEEN NURTURED IN THAT TRADITION TO BREAK FULLY FREE OF IT: TOO MANY HAVE HONOURED THE GRAVES OF YESTERDAY’S ASSASSINS TO BE WHOLLY RESISTANT TO TODAY’S. THEY HAVE SHOWN NO ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND OR SYMPATHISE WITH A MILLION OF WHAT THEY THEMSELVES CLAIM TO BE THEIR FELLOW IRISHMEN. WHAT A STRANGE FORM OF FELLOWSHIP IT IS TO VOTE MONEY FOR THE FINANCING OF SEDITION: TO EXERCISE THE JURISDICTION THEY CLAIM OUTSIDE THEIR OWN TERRITORY ONLY TO ENCOURAGE THE MOST NEGATIVE POLICIES OF ABSTENTIONISM AND CIVIC IRRESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE SEEN THE VAST CROWD GATHERED IN THE HEART OF DUBLIN TO HEAR THOSE VERY MEN WHO, WE WELL KNOW, ARE THE PRIME MOVERS OF THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE IN THE NORTH. WE HAVE SEEN THE GARDAI ’’STANDING IDLY BY’’ 
- A PHRASE FOR EVER TO BE

We would point out that Sections 5 and B(6) of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 already prohibit the making of any law or the exercise of any delegated executive power which imposes a disability or confers an advantage on grounds of religion. We believe that the most promising and practical course would be to examine these provisions 
(i) with a view to re-enacting them with, perhaps, greater precision of definition, as a Bill of Rights; and 
(ii) providing therein for a quick and effective access to the Courts to test any enactment or executive act alleged to have been in breach of its provisions. 
16. Finally, I come to the question of internment. I have received on this issue the clearest possible advice from the Army and Police, which is embodied in the attached Memorandum to the Cabinet here. My colleagus fully share my view that, even to secure some form of political or negotiating advantage, it would be quite wrong to take action which would be contrary to the clear security advice. 
17. This does not, of course, mean that there are no useful steps which we can take in relation to the internment issue. As you know, and as paragraph 10(4) of my Memorandum points out, I am attracted to the idea of introducing at an early date a form of legislation to replace the Special Powers, which would come into effect on an appointed day after violence had ended, and would inter alia then place the power of internment in suspense, to be subsequently invoked only on the declaration of a State of Emergency. The detail of such legislation is now being discussed with the Home Office. We also propose, as you will see, to issue a much more comprehensive explanation of the need for, and operation of, internment than we have done to date, and the text of this is being considered at tomorrow’s Joint Security Committee. 
18. I am, of course, most anxious that while internment lasts, as effective action as possible will be taken to improve the conditions under which internees live, including better welfare, educational and recreational facilities, with provision for rehabilitation, including if possible the provision of training. The extent to which these facilities can be provided may, of course, be conditioned by two factors - (a) security, and (b) the readiness of internees to avail of them. 
19. Moreover, serious though the effect of internment has undoubtedly been in hardening Catholic opinion, there are very real signs 
- in the view of those, like

Dr Newe, whose opinions I respect - of some degree of softening at this time, to 
which the flow of information would lend further weight. We are also reaching the point where areas of Belfast are being freed of IRA dominance and intimidation. We must be ready to move in behind this clearance with an imaginative rehabilitation exercise which will encourage people, physically and psyohologially, to restore the normal tenor of life. 
Concrete proposals to this end are about to be considered by the Cabinet. 
20. When you have had an opportunity to consider with your colleagues this letter, as well as my letter of 16 Febuary. I would very uch welcome some form of statement from you on the situation as you see it. Frankly, these matters are of such vital importance to us all, that I would like to have an opportunity of reviewing the position with my Cabinet colleagues before the further early meeting between us which is clearly desirable. 
21. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Home Secretary.

MEMORANDUM BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS ON INTERNMENT 1. 
There has been considerable speculation in the press about the possibility 
of ending internment, and when I met Mr Heath on 4 February 1972 I has asked whether I saw any early prospects of its being phased out. 
I replied that I 
shared the view of the Army that it was vital to get on top of the IRA before making any move in this direction. 2. 
In spite of the continued bombings and shootings there is ample evidence 
that the effectiveness of the IRA,especially in the Belfast area where the security forces have recently concentrated their efforts, has been very seriously reduced. 
The removal from circulation of 700 - 800 members of the 
two main organizations is creating increasing problems for them in terms both of morale and losses of key personnel. 
made good, but the officers of some companies have had to be replaced two or three times over and volunteers are now reluctant to come forard. 
in Belfast have ceased to exist and others have been amalgamatod. 
areas have been completely cleared of IRA and increasing pressure is being brought to bear on areas where groups are still active. 3. 
technical skill in the use of explosives. These losses have to some extent been 
Some units Several 
In Belfast the IRA are particularly short of leadership, experience and Taking the situation in Northern 
Ireland as a whole, about 140 important members on the wanted list are now in the Irish Republic. 
The severe dislocation of command and communication systems 
has left behind something more in the nature of a cell structure, and operations are largely carried out by small active service units, many of them based in the South. 
It must be added that these are capable of inflicting casualties 
on the security forces and of maintaining limited attacks on civilian targets for some time to come, especially outside Belfast. 4. 
There are two answers to the claim that internment has not worked. 
The first is the fact, already noted, that the IRA presence has been removed from certain areas and that this is continuing; though it is unfortunately true that those who have most to fear from the IRA are least articulate in pointing to the comparative freedom from intimidation which they are beginning to enjoy. 
Secondly, insofar as internment has not yet succeeded, this is due in no small measure to the fact that there are many people outside the IRA who do not want it to work. 
They include those who while ostensibly deploring the methods of 
the IRA have little desire to see the IRA put out of action until some at least of the organization’s aims have been achieved. 
5. in IRA recruitment. 
There is little evidence that internment has led to a substantial increase On the contrary, recent arrests indicate that most of 
those taking part in terrorist attacks were recruited in the period leading up to August of last year.

campaign to end internment and the belief that it rill succeed keeps their morale higher than is generally the case with men still at large. 6. In spite of successes against the IRA it may still be claimed that the present strategy of attrition offers steadily diminishing returns in terms of opportunities for a political settlement. 
It may indeed appear to some that efforts to secure 
a settlement cannot await the prior defeat of the IRA, or even the scaling down of violence to an acceptable level, and that there are greater chances of terminating violence by putting internment into reverse than by pursuing it to the bitter end. In pursuit of this argument it might be argued that internees should now be released at the rate of, say, 50 per month and that the rate might be increased as the situation improved; conversely that it should be cut back if there were no improvement, and that all releases should stop if a further deterioration occurred. 
Alternatively there might be a programme of releases geared to the progress of talks with the Northern Ireland opposition. 
The possibility of phasing out internment in this way has been studied, but is open to the following objections:- 
(1) All internees are, on the evidence available, either members of the IRA or otherwise involved in terrorism, and there is no pool of mere political activists from which releases can be made. 
There is, therefore, the likelihood that internees 
released as a political gesture would return to their previous activities and so repair the substantial damage which has been inflicted on both factions of the IRA since 9 August 1971. (2) If internees were released prematurely, ie before the IRA were defeated, the prime targets for retaliatory action would undoubtedly be the members of the Special Branch of the RUC: these are for the most part known to those internees whom they have arrested or interrogated. (3) The IRA would regard any programme of release for political reasons as an important success. 
and the general public. 
It would also be so regarded by members of the Security Forces The IRA could, therefore, dictate future terms. 
(4) Any decision to make no further arrests would be regarded by the IRA as a still greater achievement; they could be expected to take the opportunity to recoup their losses and to equip themselves to intensify operations at a date of their own choosing. 
Those on the run would be encouraged to return to their units. 
(5) The process of internment has provided, and continues to provide, a flow of intelligence on the membership, resources and plans of the IRA. 
interrupted the IRA could re-group with impunity. 7. 
If this flow were The Joint Security Committee have noted these conclusions and have accepted

that security grounds rule out any releases other than through the machinery of the Advisory Committee. 
a serious risk of the prolongation of the terrorist campaign. 8. 
Any other course would it is felt carry with it It is difficult to visualize any solid advantages which might outweigh 
these security objections. It may well be that internment continues to be the main cause of Catholic alienation and that it has attracted to the IRA the sympathy of sections of the Catholic population which would otherwise have no use for terrorism. 
ut it can hardly be supposed that the confidence of the minority 
is to be on back by letting the gunman loose to reimpose their will in areas from which they have been expelled. 9. 
defeated can in any way assist towards a political solution. 
Nor is it easy to see how the ending of internment before the IRA are The opposition 
have no control over the IRA and therefore no means of bringing terrorism itself under control. 
And even if a total or partial ending of internment enabled 
political talks to start a fully armed terrorist organization in the background with its ranks re-filled would inevitably dominate the course of any negotiations. 10. 
If it is accepted that there is no painless way of ending internment it 
will be necessary to say so publicly and to face the unfavourable reactions which will inevitably follow.In order to minimize these reactions certain steps can, however, be taken 
(1) The need for internment to continue may have to be spelt out more effectively. For this purpose it is proposed to give as much publicity as possible 
to a general defence of the policy and to the correcting of some of the grosser forms of misrepresentation to which it has been subjected. 
to include proposals for ending internment as soon as the IRA campaign ceases. (2) 
There will be greater stress on the easing of conditions under which 
internees live, including better welfare facilities and provision for rehabilitation. (3) 
Amending Regulations have already been drafted and will shortly be made 
which will remove some criticism of existing procedures as being too arbitrary. (4) 
As indicated in a separate memorandum, legislation is under consideration 
which would have the effect of putting the Special Powers Acts into suspense on termination of the present emergency.

January as far as William Street, at which point it was 3,000 strong. However on this occasion the stewards were able to prevent hooliganism from developin on a large scale and it was felt unnecessary to attempt an arrest operation. Most of the marchers moved on to "Free Derry Corner" where they held a rally. 8. 
Three shots were fired in the course of the afternoon: two 
from somewhere in the Creggan, which it is believed were aimed At an helicopter, and one from the area of the Rossville flats towards some armoured personnel carriers which had moved - late in the afternoon 
- into William Street to deter a handful of hooligans 
who persisted in stoning one of the barriers. A soldier had previously been knocked unconscious by a stone. The Army did not fire any shots, rubber bullets or CS. The ITN News last night gave the imression that the Army did fire rubber bullets during the afternoon; a check is being made on whether an old piece of film was being used. 9. 
The rally was addressed by two MP, Mr. McManus and Miss Devlin- 
despite the fact that it was not a NICRA occasion. It is understood that the RUC intend to prosecute Mr. McManus, but not Miss Devlin since she was not identified as taking part in the march itself. Another speaker was Farrell, a leading light of the People’s Democracy which does seem to have linked up with the NRM, both being Provisional orientated.

10. It was reported that the rally was also addressed by Fulvio imaldi, the Italian journalist who was present on 30 January and has 
since been expressing strongly anti-British view. He has already been identified as a Communist. Investigations are being made as to whether he is an accredited member of the Foreign Press Corps and, if so, whether the Corps approve of his 
activities. 
Segregation of internees 11. During the weekend the 
internees in the category of lowest 
danger who are held at Long Kesh were segregated from the remainder and moved into the newly completed compound. At the same time, 112 internees were moved to Long Kesh from Magilligan and the MAIDSTONE. The resulting distribution of internees of the three categories, and of detainees, between the three places is shown at annex. Possible Soviet Mission in Dublin 12. Speculation in the Press that a Soviet Mission may shortly be set up in Dublin reflects no new development. There are already trade missions from two other iron curtain countries there, and there has been talk for some time of inviting the Russians to set up a trade mission. It is believed that the Irish Department of External Affairs has taken a decision in principle in favour of doing so. This might of course develop in due course into an exchan e of ambassadors.

YOUR THOUGHTFUL LETTER SHOWED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US, IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ACCEDE TO THEIR DEMAND THAT INTERNMENT SHOULD FIRST BE COMPLETELY ENDED. IT WOULD NOT HELP THE CAUSE OF PEACE, IF A LARGE NUMBER OF GUNMEN WERE RELEASED. AS FOR DR.

those allegations; at an allegation of a beating-up in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast has already been investigated and refuted 
by the hospital authorities; and that some of the complainants have since been convicted of serious crimes and sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment. 12. It will of course continue to be claimed on behalf of the Catholic communitythat the RUC cannot be relied upon to conduct a genuinely independent investigation: and the continuing Compton machinery, when it becomes available to look into complaints arising from arrests and 48-hour custody at Police Holding Centres, is hardly likelier to satisfy the Catholic hard-liners or their supporters at Westminster. It will have to be argued that there is a limit to the extent to which any Government is prepared to hand over the investigation of complaints to outside agencies or to demonstrate lack of confidence in the good faith of the properly constituted civil authorites. Long Kesh 13. A further compound at Long Kesh is now ready for occupation and it is intended to use this one for those of the internees in the lowest of the three categories who are at Long Kesh.

Northern Ireland The questions for discussion at tomorrow’s meeting can perhaps be 
grouped under 3 heads:A. The substance of the Policy. B. 
The hazards of acting. C. The timing of action. 
A. 2. 
The substance of the Policy The memorandum before Ministers deals only with the interim period 
of commission government. For this purpose it assumes approval of the long term plan to be worked out during the interim period (i.e. a revised form of Government and Parliament at Stormont coupled with periodical referenda on the Border and a progressive relaxation of internment). is acceptable so far as tomorrow’s meeting is concerned. 
But when the 
matter is put to Cabinet it will, of course, be necessary to expose the long term plan in detail, as well as the arrangements for commission government; and we shall in particular,have to decide how much should be said about the long term plan - especially as regards the relaxation of internment 
- when 
commission government is instituted. 3. 
As regards the interim period of commission government itself, the 
following points need to be noted and/or decided:(i) 
There is to be a separate Minister for Northern Ireland. Is this right, as distinct from leaving the Home Secretary in charge? If so, how many junior Ministers will he need? Possibly one in the Lords and one in the Commons, the latter being required to spend a great deal of his time in Belfast. And is the Minister to be wholly separate from the Home Office; or can he rely on it for such "common services" as establishments, finance, etc. ? 
(ii) 
On any of these hypotheses it would be wise to select the individual who is to be the Minister and to give him as much advance notice as possible in order to enable him to get to grips with the problems which he will face. 
(iii) He will need supporting United Kingdom staff - both in London 
and in Belfast. How many? Where from? And how easily available ?

NORTHER IRELAND - MR FAULKNER’S LETTERS OF 16th FEBRUARY AND 1st MARCH 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
Mr Faulkner’s proposals consist of the following:(a) his Green Paper with certain additions; (b) periodic referenda on the border, though in some important respects on a different basis from our ideas; 
(c) a solemn and binding agreement by the Republic to recognise the Government of Northern Ireland leading to 
(d) 
a common policy North and South on the suppression of illegal organizations and if this is agreed 
(e) a joint Irish Inter-Government Council with equal members from the Governments in the North and South as a form for discussion of economic and social questions; 
(f) a willingness to accept the enactment, presumably at Westminster, of a Bill of Rights. 
2. 
Specifically rejected are:(a) any place in Government for representatives of the minority community as of right; 
(b) the transfer of "law and order" powers to Westminster; (c) any change, while the violence continues, in the policy of internment; 
(d) the transfer to the Republic of any part of Northern Ireland. 
GREEN PAPER 3. 
The following additions to the Green Paper proposals are offered:(a) an extension of the role of functional committees to include law and order as well as other matters; 
(b) an additional power allowing the committees, subject to safeguards, to originate their own proposals on policy.

INTERNMENT 11. In his letter of 1 March Mr Faulkner deals at some length with internment and attaches a copy of a memorandum on the subject which he had circulated to his Cabinet. Both the memorandum and the letter rely heavily on the joint paper which the army and the police submitted to the Northern Ireland Joint Security Committee 
No modification to the 
operation of the internment policy until violence has ended except for some improvements in the conditions of the internment camps. TRANSFER OF PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE REPUBLIC 12. Mr Faulkner records his conclusion that to attempt to ease the security problem by transferring parts of the Province to the Republic would create more problems than it would solve. FURTHER CONSULTATION 13. Mr Faulkner stresses in his letter of 16 February that it is his understanding and that of his colleagues that "... any new, albeit provisional, conclusions reached by the United Kingdom Government will be put to our Cabinet for our consideration and comment before any concrete action is taken or any public disclosure made". He repeats the point in a different form in his letter of 1 March. We know from contacts at official level that Stormont Ministers will not be slow to complain if they can assert that they were faced with a fait accompli. SUMMARY 14. Mr Faulkner’s proposals,with the exception of a pretty tightly drawn referendum ammount to a development, not in itself without merit, of his present ideas for changes as set out in his Green Paper. The Northern Ireland Parliament continues with its present range of functions and responsibilities; Westminster assumes no new role in the Province and responsibility for law and order stays as it is; representatives of the minority community are not to be brought into Government except on invitation of the Prime Minister; any change in internment policy is stoutly resisted; there are proposals for closer association with the Republic but they have no real chance of acceptance in the South.

March 9 1972 
We have been asked to relea the following statement: I.R.A. PEACE PROPOSAlS 
The leadership of the Republican Movement wishes to state that the following conditions are considered necessary to secure peace in the present conflict between British and Irish forces:

Northern Ireland Perhaps the simplest way of guiding tomorrow’s Cabinet to the 
necessary conclusion would be as follows:(1) Some form of political initiative is now inevitable. 
Public 
expectation has been too far aroused, and speculation has become too widespread, to enable the Government to remain inactive any further. Alternatively, if they do refrain from any action, the situation could very rapidly turn very sour indeed. (2) At the same time there is no point in launching an initiative unless:(a) (b) 
the scheme is workable in practice; 
it is worth it in terms of the probable result, South of the Border no less than North; 
(c) (3) 
it is politically sustainable in the sense that the Government can carry it through, if necessary, against determined opposition. The Home Secretary’s proposals (possibly amended as the Foreign 
and Commonwealth Secretary suggests in the minute which he has sent you today) broadly satisfy (a) and (b). 
It is at (c) that they are most vulnerable 
in terms both of criticism from the Government’s supporters at Westminster and of the risk of a Protestant backlash in Ulster. And I suspect that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary’s variant would not be much less exposed to hostility - if only because few people would believe that at the end of six months we should really be able to impose a solution in default of agreement. (4) 
If the Cabinet would prefer something less than the Home Secretary’s 
proposals, they must decide how much less. Should it be only a referendum on the Border, the appointment of a separate Secretary of State and the transfer of law and order to Westminster? Or even merely the transfer of responsibility for internment? On either hypothesis:(a) This limited initiative should be workable in practice 
- but at the cost 
of making an arbitrary division between law and order on the one hand and other functions of government on the other hand, with the implication that Westminster would carry the responsibility for the

most sensitive and odious of those functions in Northern Ireland while Stormont would retain the power in other areas of administration which are often the occasion of the grievances which threaten law and order. If the transfer were limited even more narrowly, i.e. to internment alone, there would be the additional complication of dividing the allegiance of the RUC. 
(b) 
It would be very doubtfully worth it in terms of the probable result. The minority in the North would be unlikely to offer their co-operation if Stormont were left in existence in any form or to any extent; and we could expect little from Mr. Lynch, if he were offered merely a referendum on the Border (the outcome of which would be predictably in favour of the Protestants) and a transfer of law and order to Westminster unaccompanied by any guarantee of greater minority participation in the Government at Stormont. His reaction would be even more unfavourable if we proscribed the IRA in Great Britain at the same time. If the package also included an undertaking progressively to ease internment, the position might be rather different. But an easing of internment might not outweigh the proscription of the IRA. And in any case could Mr. Faulkner stand it? 
(c) 
It would probably be more sustainable politically than the Home Secretary’s proposals 
- both as giving less offence to the 
Government’s supporters at Westminster and as involving less risk of a Protestant backlash in Ulster. But even this cannot be assumed too lightly relaxed as part of the deal. 
- especially if internment were (5) The Cabinet must face up to this choice and decide which way they 
wish to go. And the longer they defer a decision, the more vulnerable they will be to the charge of doing too little too late. 
In any event it will not be 
possible to postpone some overt indication of the Government’s intentions beyond this week; and the most probable timetable now seems to envisage a Government statement in the next few days to the effect that Mr. Faulkner (? with some of his colleagues) is being invited to London for discussions next week. We cannot move more quickly, since it is now essential to get President Pompidou’s visit and the Budget out of the way before running into what may be a critical situation in Ulster. This points to a meeting in the

NOTE OF A MEETING WITH DR. O’CONNELL. I spent an hour and a quarter with Dr. O’Connell this morning. He 
began by saying that his objective was to meet the Home Secretary and he agreed to see me under the impression that our discussion would be only preliminary. 
see the Home Secretary, and that the Home Secretary had asked me to see Dr. O’Connell on his behalf and report our conversation to him. 
I explained that we certainly understood that he wanted to If the 
Home Secretary considered it appropriate to see Dr. O’Connell himself this might follow, but I could give no commitment. 
Dr. O’Connell was prepared 
to go ahead on this basis. He had had discussions with leaders of the I.R.A. and with Dr. Paisley. 
The proposal which had emerged from these discussions was that the I.R.A. would declare that they were calling off the campaign of violence on the understanding that after 30 days of peace, internment would be ended and a week thereafter talks would begin. at these talks. 
The I.R.A. wanted to be represented Dr. O’Connell suggested one from the Provisional and one 
from the Official I.R.A., though they need not appear at the table behind I.R.A. labels. 
Dr. O’Connell claimed that he had persuaded Paisley to 
accept their presence at the table; there was a precedent in Michael Collins’ discussions with Sir James Craig. There was a certain amount of obscurity as to what was to happen during Dr. O’Connell suggested that if the violence stopped, the 
I gained the impression that the the 30 days. troops could be withdrawn to barracks. 
I.R.A. envisaged the 30 days as a kind of truce in which the army would not take "offensive" action against them, and perhaps might even withdraw from the streets, whereas Dr. O’Connell emphasised that it would be a unilateral cessation of violence by the I.R.A. 
The public presentation of the agreement 
was also flexible; it was not necessary to announce on day 1 that internment would end in 30 days. 
It could be that the I.R.A. would publicly announce

that they were calling off their campaign without making public the agreement that 30 days later the British Government would respond by ending internment. In response to my question about what would happen if talks broke down, Dr. O’Connell said that the I.R.A. were prepared to agree in advance a minimum period during which discussions could continue without their resuming violence; in his discussion with the leadership three months had been mentioned first, and six months had been quite easily agreed. 
The I.R.A. 
were particularly anxious to establish a place for themselves at the conference table. Dr. O’Connell was very vague about the solution which should emerge 
from the talks, but he was clearly thinking in terms of a move towards a united Ireland. 
The I.R.A. want an Ulster Parliament, for nine counties, -prisoners". 
which would be one of several, looking eventually to an all-Ireland Parliament. Dr. O’Connell said he had persuaded them to accept that agreement to discuss a united Ireland at the talks, without a prior commitment to it, was acceptable Also on the agenda for talks should be "an amnesty for political By this Dr. O’Connell meant people imprisoned in Great Britain 
for offences involving obtaining arms for the I.R.A., as well as marchers subject to a mandatory six-month sentence. 
was looking to a phased withdrawal of British troops. follow what he meant by this. 
More important, Dr. O’Connell It was difficult to The emphasis was more on getting them off the 
streets so that their presence was similar to that of troops in England and Wales rather than leaving Northern Ireland without any armed forces whatever. Dr. O’Connell was clearly thinking towards a united Ireland, but he 
accepted that reform of Stormont giving a guaranteed place for the minority in the Government might serve as an interim arrangement, leading to a united Ireland by agreement.

to enter into such talks so long as internment is maintained in Northern Ireland. 
The events at Londonderry on 30 January, when thirteen 
people were killed in clashes between the security forces and people associated with a Civil Rights march, were a very considerable shock to public opinion not only in Northern Ireland but in Great Britain and in the Irish Republic. It seemed as if they might have created a climate in which there was a prospect of making a political initiative which could be acceptable to majority opinion in Northern Ireland and at the same time to a great body of moderate Catholic opinion on both sides of the border. The essentials of such an initiative would be that there should be no change in the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, but that changes should be made in the form of Government of Northern Ireland which would give the minority parties the assurance of an active and permanent share in the decisions which shape the Government and the future of the Province. The situation is one of great complexity, because of 
the difficulty of finding a solution which will commend itself to so many different and disparate shades of opinion. The Protestant majority in Northern Ireland clearly 
wish the Province to continue as part of the United Kingdom.

more prospect of persuading them to pursue a more vigorous policy against the I.R.A. in the Republic. It is of course in the end in their interests to do so: the official wing of the I.R.A. is as great a threat to the Irish Government as it is to Stormont. It is necessary also to have regard to public opinion 
in Britain. I do not need to remind Your Majesty that Ireland has a long history in British politics, and it is important that any political initiative which is taken should command as wide as possible a measure of support in this country, and especially in Parliament. It seems likely that among the ingredients of any 
political initiative should be the appointment of a new Secretary of State in the British Government, to take over from the Home Secretary his present responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs, some indication that the policy of internment is being wound down (so that there is a prospect of increasing releases as and when violence dies down), and probably the transfer of responsibility for law and order from Stormont to Westminster. This last ingredient, however, is likely to be particularly controversial in Northern Ireland. It is not clear whether Your Majesty’s present Ministers in Northern Ireland would be prepared to continue to serve, if they no longer had responsibility for law and order in the Province. If they

Cabinet: Northern Ireland The Cabinet will wish to hear from Mr. Whitelaw a report on his 
visit to Northern Ireland over the weekend. Perhaps the main points to be dealt with can be grouped under the following headings A. 
The Security Situation (1) What were the reactions of the minority (and the IRA); the 
majority (according to whether they are followers of Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Paisley or Mr. Craig); the RUC; and the public service? In particular, how far can we continue to rely on the loyalty of the last two groups? (2) What are the risks of renewed violence and/or civil disobedience 
and industrial action? Are the security forces confident that they can deal with situations of this kind? (3) Are the preparations for the Easter marches adequate and complete? B. 
The Legal Basis of the New Regime 
(1) Are arrangements for the Commons debate agreed; and can we be reasonably sure that the Bill will receive Royal Assent before close of play on Thursday? In so far as certain Orders in Council may be needed immediately thereafter, are these ready? (2) How much Northern Ireland legislation which may be urgently 
needed will not reach the Statute Book before Stormont is prorogued? Is the Chief Whip satisfied that this potentially heavy item of additional Westminster business can be accommodated in the Government’s legislative programme without too much difficulty? (3) What are Mr. Whitelaw’s intentions about the establishment 
of his Advisory Commission in Northern Ireland? C. 
The Longer Term (1) How rapidly will Mr. Whitelaw be able to start releasing internees? 
Does he propose to deal with these cases entirely on his own responsibility? Or will he want to discuss at least the basic principles and criteria with his colleagues?

Labour Party in Parliament to Mr. Heath’s decision to impose direct rule in Northern Ireland -- a decision that was desperate but a decision that was right. 
Ana, just as he had the full support of all Parties in the House of 
Commons, to-day I want to give our fullest backing to the appeal he made on television on Friday and to Mr. hitelaw’s appeal yesterday in Belfast for toleration and understanding and an end of bitterness and violence.

the British Government’s new proposals. During the long period of waiting for the Government promised package, there were many who feared that Northern 
Ireland was heading for civil war. Both sides armed and British troops caught in a cross-fire. 
After seven weeks of anxious waiting, last week 
the Government finally agreed on their plan. It contained two essential decisions for which we had pressed through all these weeks. 
The phasing out 
of internment, of imprisonment without trial, and the transfer of responsibility for security from the Stormont Government to estminster. 
There was a reason for our insistence. 
British tro s, who were cheered in the streets when the Labour Government put them in August, 1969, to guarantee firmly and fairly and impartially all communities from any threats of violence are now, through no fault of their own, being pilloried and attacked as the military support of a sectarian regina.

of the security role. It was Stormont’s rejection that brought us unevitably to direct rule.

urgently required will be immeasurably more difficult unless all Parties, all people, can come together in an atmosphere of peace and of hope.

DUBLIN TELEGRAM 222 OF 25 MARCH RFI UPREP BELFAST DIRECT RULE: IRISH REACTIONS. 
1. APART FROM THE SINN FEIN/IRA’S THE REACTION OF ALL POLITICAL 
GROUPS IN THE REPUBLIC HAS BEEN ONE OF RELIEF AND THEIR LEADERS, PARTICULARLY THE TAOISEACH ARE EVIDENTLY PRESSING HARD UPON THE NORTHERN MINORITY TO BE COOPERATIVE. THIS MORNINGS DECLARATION BY THE SDLP IS THE FIRST VISIBLE RESULT, AND SUCH PRESSURE IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE. 
2. I MUST HOWEVER UTTER A NOTE OF CAUTION AMIDST AND ABOUT THE 
PRESENT GENERAL EUPHORIA IN THE REPUBLIC. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COULD GO SERIOUSLY WRONG IN AREAS OF POLITICS IN WHICH DUBLIN HAS CONSIDERABLE AND NOW INCREASED INFLUENCE AMONG THE MINORITIES. WE NEED TO APPRECIATE JUST HOW THIS INFLUENCE WILL BE EXERTED DURING THE NEXT FEW CRUCIAL WEEKS, ON THE SUBJECTS OF (1) SECURITY AND THE ENDING OF VIOLENCE (2) INTERNMENT (3) REUNIFICATION (4) TIMING. 
3. OF THESE, (1) AND (2) ARE CLOSELY INTERCONNECTED. THE BASIC 
ISSUE IS THE EXACT WAY IN WHICH THE IRISH SEE THE IRA BEING DEFEATED THROUGH THEIR LOSS OF POPULAR CATHOLIC SUPPORT. ONLY TO A LIMITED DEGREE WOULD THEY VISUALIZE IT HAPPENING THROUGH AN INCREASED FLOW OF INTELLIGENCE TO THE ARMY AND TE RUC, DENIAL OF SAFE HOUSES AND ARMS CACHES ETC, THUS MAKING IT EASIER FOR OUR SECURITY FORCES TO SEARCH AND CAPTURE OR DESTROY. THEY FORSEE THE IRA IN THE NORTH EVAPORATING IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT ALWAYS HAS. PUBLIC SUPPORT WITHERS AWAY, THEY JUST BURY THEIR ARMS AND MERGE INTO ORDINARY NON-VIOLENT LIFE, AND THE STRUGGLE IS EITHER DORMANT OR NON-VIOLENT. IT FOLLOWS THAT THE IRISH ARE EXPECTING MODIFICATIONS IN CURRENT SECURITY PROCEDURES IN PURSUIT OF SUSPECTS, SEARCHES OF HOUSES ETC, AND ANY EVIDENCE THAT DIRECT RULE HAS PRODUCED NO CHANGE AFTER A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD WILL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD DISILLUSIONMENT.

4. SIMILARLY THEY EXPECT MORE ABOUT INTERNMENT THAN GRADUAL hASING OUT. APART FROM NATURAL BUT MANAGEABLE IMPATIENCE FOR AN EARLY START AND MORE RAPID RELEASES THAN IS REALISTIC THE IRISH HOPE THAT NEW INTERNMENTS WILL BE KEPT TO AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM AND NORMAL JUDICIAL PROCEDURES SUBSTITUTED. 
5. REUNIFICATION. ALTHOUGH THE IRISH GOVERNMENT HAVE SO FAR 
CAREFULLY AVOIDED ANY EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO HIS, MOST PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH WILL ASSUME THAT HMG’S INITIATIVE IS A STEP ON THE WAY. THE DANGER WOULD LIE IN THEIR FINDING ANY GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION THAT WE WERE YIELDING TO PRESSURE TO INTEGRATE NORTHERN IRELAND TOTALLY IN THE UK. OUR PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THIS POINT GIVE FULL REASSURANCE, BUT WE MAY NEED TO REPEAT THEM AT INTERVALS. THERE IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE GROWING INTEREST BOTH IN THE TIMING AND THE TERMS OF THE QUESTION OR QUESTIONS PUT IN THE PLEBISCITE IE WILL IT ALLOW FOR ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS FEDERATION, REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS, ETC? 
6. TIMING. THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERS ARE 
VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE NEED TO GO SLOWLY ENOUGH TO HELP THE UNIONISTS ADJUST, BUT THEY ALWAYS ATTACH MUCH STORE BY EVIDENCE OF FUTURE INTENTIONS, AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH MOMENTUM. POPULAR OPINION WILL OF COURSE WANT TO GO TOO FAR TOO FAST. 
7. I MUST REPEAT THAT ALL GOES WELL HERE, AND THIS TELEGRAM 
IS DESIGNED ONLY TO CALL ATTENTION TO POSSIBLE AND AVOIDABLE PITFALLS IN THE ROAD ON WHICH WE HAVE EMBARKED.

THE SDLP NOW BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONALS IN THE NORTH WILL BE SPLIT INTERNALLY AND FROM THEIR SOUTHERN HQ OVER THE QUESTION OF CONTINUED VIOLENCE. 
2. HALLIGAN URGED A PERSONAL SUGGESTION THAT AN 
INVITATION FROM MR WHITELAW TO THE SDLP TO MEET HIM IN BELFAST DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS WOULD HELP STIFFEN THEIR RESOLVE. THERE ARE OBVIOUS DIFFICULTIES OVER FLATTERING THE SDLP AT THIS TIME, BUT AS SEEN FROM HERE SUCH A GESTURE, AS SOON AS IT IS PRACTICAL POLITICS, WOULD BE USEFUL.

"TODAY PROGRAMME" Transmitted 24 March 1972 EDWARD HEATH: Memories of the past are 
long lived. In all conscience you have suffered enough. What....(PAUSE 
Memories of the past are long lived. In all conscience you have suffered enough. What the government has done today, it is intended to give us the opportunity to put the past behind us. And to concentrate on the future. Let us take that opportunity together. Goodnight. 
PAUSE.....MUSIC EAMONN ANDREWS: 
Hello there. Crisis in 
Ulster, the suspension of Stormont, the introduction of direct rule, and the gradual phase out of internment, the guts of the Prime Minister’s long awaited Ulster initiative. Well here in the studio we have all shades of political opinion. And in the next hour we’ll try to present a picture to you of just what the massive change over’s going to mean, whether it’ll lead to eventual peace, or bloody civil war. And we start with Irish reaction. And just at this stage of the programme we’re going to just have opinions that will take about a minute, and then we come back and discuss them in more detail, and we start with the man you’ve probably just seen a moment ago, on the news, the Reverend Ian Paisley. What is your reaction and your prediction for the future as a result of this? 
REV IAN PAISLEY: Well I think that the 
government ah, at Westminster ah, has launched itself on a voyage of catastrophe, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, and ah, my reaction is great disappointment, that they should after taking soundings on Northern Ireland about this situation, ah, persisted in this particular policy. About the future we can only hope and pray, and wait, events and I do trust that this will not lead to more violence. God knows we’ve had enough violence in Northern Ireland. 
Q: A: When you say a voyage of 
catastrophe, do you in fact mean, or think, a voyage of violence? 
Ah, I certainly do, because of 
the situation is simply this: That ah, ah, Mr Heath tells us tonight we are part and parts of the United Kingdom, we’re equal with all the other citizens in the United Kingdom, and now he proposes to rule us by decree

A MINISTERIAL BROADCAST by 
THE PRIME MINISTER 
Sund recorded from No. 10 Downing Street 1600 for transmission BBC-1 1800 
24th March 1972 I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - and in 
particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion. 
Northern Ireland and by the suffering it has caused. 
All of us have been horrified by the violence in As a government 
we have been doing everything in our power to bring that violence and that suffering to an end, because the United Kingdom, Parliament and government have the same duty towards the people of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country, to 
protect their lives and property and to give them 
-- all of them -- a fair say in the decisions that shape their future. No single measure can overcome the bitterness of the past few years the bitterness, indeed of far too much of Northern Ireland’s history. The government have concluded, after long and anxious thought, that we must make possible a completely fresh start; and so we have worked out a set of proposals to provide this fresh star, the fresh start which is needed if we are to break out of the vicious circle of violence and yet more violence. 
1: 2: 3: 
Last Wednesday I put these proposals to Mr. Faulkner: That the United Kingdom government should take over 
responsibility for law and order in Northern. Ireland That there should be a gradual reduction in 
internment, beginning with those internees who could be released without unacceptable risks. 
That the people of Northern Ireland should be 
given a chance as soon as it is practicable and again at intervals later, to decide for themselves in a plebiscite whether or not they want to remain in the United Kingdom.

MR. FAULKNER’S VIEW ON INTERNMENT 1. 
In the course of our discussions the Prime Minister of Northern 
Ireland explained that he also would be prepared to accept a start being made on the release of internees. There is no difference of principle between us on this point. A VICTORY FOR THE IRA 2. 
The IRA have demanded: the withdrawal of the Army from the streets; the abolition of Stormont; an amnesty; 
The army will not be withdrawan from the streets until their presence is no longer necessary; Stormont is not being abolished 
- the Parliament simply stands 
prorogued; We aim to reduce the level of internment but there is no question of an amnesty for those who have been convicted of offences of violence. 
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO INTRODUCE A PLEBISCITE ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND BUT NOT ABOUT ENTRY INTO THE EEC? 3. 
In the United Kingdom we have a fully effective Parliamentary 
system for debating and deciding on issues such as entry into the EEC. One of the problems in Northern Ireland has been the organisation of political parties on a sectarian basis which has in turn meant a permanent one-party majority in the Northern Ireland Parliament. In Northern Ireland there has not been the same confidence in all sections of the community in the Parliamentary system as a means of reaching decisions on vital issues such as the Border. It seems right therefore that in these special circumstances, a plebiscite should be used to permit a direct expression of opinion of the people.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE POSITION OF THE GOC AND HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ISLAND NEW 4. The GOC will remain responsible to the Chief of the General 
Staff, and through him to the Secretary of State for Defence, for the conduct of operations by the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland. He will of course act in close consultation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. [If pressed: The detailed arrangements for such consultation are now being drawn up; I would prefer not to say any more about them at this stage.] WILL THE GOC HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE RUC? 5. 
will therefore continue, as Director of Operations, to co-ordinate the allocation of duties to the RUC where security operations are concerned.] WILL THE JOINT SECURITY COMMITTEE CONTINUE? 6. 
The GOC’s relationship to the RUC will remain unchanged. [He It is at present envisaged that the Joint Security Committee 
will remain in being; [if so, the GOC and the Chief Constable will Of course remain members of it.] 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE MEASURES JUST ANNOUNCED ON THE ARMY AND ITS OPERATIONS 
7. The Army will continue, as at present, to act in support of 
the civil authority in maintaining law and order. [The Army’s main tasks will thus remain unchanged: to prevent intercommunal clashes and to take such action as in necessary to counter terrorism. Precautionary steps have been taken to enable additional units to be moved to Northern Ireland if they should be required. 
IS IT TRUE THAT THE ADVICE GIVEN BY THE ARMY (IN A PAPER CONSIDERED BY THE JSC ON 17 FEBRUARY WAS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE TO START 
RELEASING INTERNEES IN ANY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS? 8. It is not the practice to reveal the confidential advice 
given by military officers or by officials and I am not prepared either to confirm or to deny that advice of the kind described /wa s given on

was given on the future policy for internment. But I can say that the decision which I have just announced in relation to interment is fully endorsed by the Government’s professional military advisors. 
9. As my rt. hon. Friend the Home Secretary said in the House 
on the 28th of February, we are examining all means that night be used to oounter th terrorist activities of the IRA. The police are doing everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for the outrage at Addershot. [But as my rt. hon. Friend also said in the House yesterday, while we fully understand the feelings of those who argue that the IRA should be proscribed, the translation of these feelings into a law on the Statute Book presents considerable difficulty.]

TIMES STORY THAT "THE RUC AS AN ENTITY WOULD CEASE TO EXIST AND THE POLICE WOULD BECOME JUST ANOTHER PART OF THE BRITISH FORCES" 
10. This is not the case. The RUC Police Authority will continue as now. But the powers now held by the Minister of Homo Affairs in Northern Ireland will pass to the new Secretary of State. WHEN WILL THE BILL BE AVAILABLE? 11. Copies of the draft Bill are now available in the Vote Office. The Bill will be presented on Monday. JUDGE BROWN’S COMMITTEE 12. An appeal committee to hear applications from internees is mandatory under the existing regulations.

TEXT OF A MINISTERIAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RIGHT HON. EDWARD I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: and in particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion. All of us have been horrified by the violence in Northern Ireland and by 
the suffering it has caused. As a Government we have been doing everything in our power to bring that violence and that suffering to an end. Because the United Kingdom Parliament and Government have the same duty towards the people of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country property, and to give them - 
all of them - a fair say in the decisions that 
shape their future. No single measure can overcome the bitterness of the past few years - the bitterness indeed of far too much of Northern Ireland’s history. The Government have concluded after long and anxious thought that we must make possible a completely fresh start. And so we have worked out a set of proposals to provide this fresh start 
out of the vicious circle of violence and yet more violence. Last Wednesday I put these proposals to Mr. Faulkner: First, that the United Kingdom Government should take over responsibility 
for law and order in Northern Ireland. Second, that there should be a gradual reduction in internment beginning 
with those internees who could be released without unacceptable risks. Third, that the people of Northern Ireland should be given a chance as soon 
as it is practicable, and again at intervals later, to decide for themselves in a plebiscite whether or not they want to remain in the United Kingdom. These were the proposals which I put to Mr. Faulkner on Wednesday. We 
had hoped that he and his colleagues might see their way to accepting them. I was very sorry when he told me that he and his colleagues could not continue as the Government of Northern Ireland if responsibility for law and order were transferred to Westminster. But we believe that nothing less than the proposals I have described would enable us to break out of the deadlock of the last few months. The Government here in London is therefore obliged to take over for the time being full responsibility for the conduct of affairs in Northern Ireland. The Army will stay in Northern Ireland as long as any faction seeks to terrorise or intimidate ordinary people. There will be no let-up in the fight against terrorism. All the security forces will continue to have our full backing and support. I want, before I end, to say a special word to those of you who are our fellow citizens living in Northern Ireland. You are the ones who have had to endure the years of violence and fear. We admire the steadiness and courage with which you have done this. Now only you can take the decision to live together peace.

Regulation 10 empowers the RUC be arrest and hold for up to 48 hours any person in order to question them. The initial arrests in the internment exercise have been under this power. Regulation 11 allows the detention of persons without trial for an unspecified period on the order of the Civil Authority. Those initially arrested under Regulation 10 since internment began have been held under this regulation after 48 hours but before internment. Regulation 12 provides for internment. Regulation 23E was made by Major Chichester-Clark on 11 February 1971 requires everyone to tell a policeman or soldier if they believe someone has been wounded etc by a firearm or bomb. Regulation 24 made by Major Chichester Clark on the same day makes it an offence to dress or behave in a public place so as to cause reasonable grounds for assuming that one supports the IR. Regulation 33 provides an all-embracing power for the direction and restriction of the use of vehicles. Regulation 34A allows the requisition of land and buildings. Regulation 38A allows restriction on the use of premises for the purpose of entertainment or sport. This allowed a game of rugby football involving the Springboks touring team to be banned. Regulation 39 made on 16 October 1969 enables licensing hours to be restricted. Regulation 40 made on 23 July 1970 allows the banning of processions or public meetings.

TO IMMEDIATE THE HOLY SEE TELNO. 6 OF 24 MARCH INFO SAVING DUBLIN UKREP BELFAST. NORTHERN IRELAND. THE PRIME MINISTER WILL MAKE A STATEMENT AT 11 A.M. OUR TIME 
FRIDAY, 24 MARCH. YOU SHOULD DELIVER THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM ME TO THE CARDINAL SECRETARY OF STATE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE MESSAGE IS SELF-EXPLANATORY. YOU SH ULD STRESS THAT IT IS CONFIDENTIAL, AND THAT THE CONTENTS MUST NOT BECOME KNOWN BEFORE THE PRIME MINISTER SPEAKS. 
2. (QUOTE. AS YOU KNOW, MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN GIVING URGENT CONSIDERATION TO THE PROBLEMS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WITH A VIEW TO SEEING WHAT COULD AND SHOULD BE DONE TO BRING US CLOSER TO ACHIEVING A LASTING PEACE IN THE PROVINCE. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD WITH DR. HILLERY IN FEBRUARY. ’’I AM THEREFORE SENDING THIS MESSAGE SO THAT YOU 
ARE INFORMED OF THE DECISIONS WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE ANNOUNCING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS. WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT A SOLUTION TO THIS WHOLE PROBLEM CANNOT 
BE ACHIEVED OVER NIGHT. BUT THE MEASURES WE HAVE DECIDED UPON ARE NOT MERE PALLIATIVES. OUR AIM IS TO ELIMINATE THE PRESENT CAUSES OF STRIFE AND ACHIEVE A CLIMATE IN WHICH BOTH COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WILL COME TOGETHER TO CREATE A PEACEFUL AND JUST SOCIETY. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NEVER BELIEVED THAT THE PROLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND CAN BE RESOLVED BY PURELY MILITARY MEANS. UNFORTUNATELY, DESPITE CONTINUING ATTEMPTS. TO GET INTER-COMMUNAL DISCUSSIONS GOING, THERE HAS HITHERTO BEEN NO MOVE TOWARDS RECONCILIATION, AND OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF GETTING WORSE. WE HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED THAT A NEW AND MORE RADICAL EFFORT MUST BE MADE. THE ESSENTIAL MEASURES ON WHICH WE HAVE DECIDED INCLUDE THE TRANSFER OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER FROM STORMONT TO WEST MINISTER: A REVIEW OF EXISTING INTERNMENT ORDERS SO THAT THE LESS IMPORTANT OF THE INTERNEES ARE PROGRESSIVELY RELEASED: THE APPOINTMENT OF A SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AS A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT; AND A SYSTEM OF REGULAR PLEBISCITES ABOUT THE BORDER, THE FIRST TO BE HELD AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND OTHERS AT INTERVALS THEREATFER.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL APPOINT A COMMISSION OF PERSONS RESIDENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND TO ADVISE AND ASSISTHIM. THE AIM WILL BE T PEOPLE FULLY REPRESENTATIVE OF NORTHERN IRELAND OPINION. 
I DO NOT PRETEND THAT WHAT WE ARE NOW DOING CONSTITUTES THE WHOLE SWER. MEANS MUST STILL BE FOUND WHICH WILL ENSURE FOR THE MINORITY D THE MAJORITY COMMUNITY AN ACTIVE, PERMANENT AND GUARANTEED ROLE THE LIFE AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE. OUR IMMEDIATE 
WE HAVE ALSO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE TO BRING INTERMENT TO AN END, WHEN RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND A NORMAL SITUATION OF ORDER HAVE BEEN RESTORED THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE. AFTER RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED, WE WILL RELEASE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THOSE INTERNEES WHOSE FREEDOM IS NOT NOW CONSIDERED TO INVOLVE ANY UNREASONABLE RISK TO SECURITY. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IS ESTABLISHING IMEDIATELY A PROCEDURE TO REVIEW EACH CASE PERSONALLY. IF THE MEASURES WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN LEAD, AS WE HOPE THEY WILL, TO A REDUCTION IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER FURTHER RELEASES: BUT THIS MUST OF COURSE DEPEND ON A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION. AS LONG AS ACTIVE TERRORISM PERSISTS AND BOMBING AND SHOOTING CONTINUE, WE MUST RETAIN THE POWER TO ARREST AND INTERN THOSE WHO THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED. 
THIS GOVERNMENT, AND ITS PREDECESSORS, HAVE GIVEN SOLEMN AND REPEATED ASSURANCES THAT THE.CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF NORTHERN IRELAND AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL NOT BE CHAGED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND. I KNOW YOUR OWN FEELINGS ON THIS MATTER, AND I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR FIRM ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT ONLY THROUGH PEACEFUL AGREEMENT IS UNIFICATION POSSIBLE. WE HAVE DECIDED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE PROVISIONS OF THE IRELAND ACT (1949) WHICH REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARLIAMENT TO ANY CHANGE IN THE BORDER REMAIN IN BEING iT WOULD NOW BE HELPFUL IF ARRANGEMENTS WERE TO BE MADE FOR THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND ON UNIFICATION TO BE MADE KNOWN FROM TIME TO TIME. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FOR A SYSTEM OF REGULAR PLEBISCITES ABOUT THE BORDER, THE FIRST TO BE HELD AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND OTHERS AT INTERVALS OF A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF YEARS THEREAFTER. AS I HAVE SO OFTEN SAID BEFORE, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF THE PEACEFULLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF NORTHERN IRELAND CITIZENS. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH THIS CANNOT BE ASSURED, A PLEBISCITE SYSTEM SHOULD, WE CALCULATE, ENSURE A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND ENABLE NORTHERN IRISH POLITICS TO BE CONCENTRATED ON MATTERS OTHER THAN THE BORDER. 
PROPOSALS ARE PUT FORWARD AND.WILL BE ACTED UPON IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL SO CHANGE THE CLIMATE OF POLITICAL OPINION IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT DISCUSSIONS CAN BE RESUMED IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AGREEMENT ON A NEW WAY FORWARD. 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT PERIOD - DIFFICULT NOT ONLY FOR US, AND FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND, BUT ALSO, I RECOGNISE FOR THE REPUBLIC, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT I CAN NOW LOOK TO YOU AND TO YOUR GOVERNMENT FOR ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO PREVENT TROUBLEMAKERS FROM EXACERBATING THE SUTUATION. THE PROTESTANTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AREHAVING TO SWALLOW SOME HARSH MEDICINE: ANY SUGGESTION THAT, IN ADDITION TO CHANGES AT HOME, THEY MUST FACE IMMINENTLY A CHANGE IN THEIR NATIONAL STATUS, OR ANY SUGGESTION THAT THESE CHANGES ARE A VICTORY FOR THE I R A, WILL ONLY SERVE TO INCREASE THE CHANCE OF A BACKLASH. 
SUCH SUGGESTIONS WILL CERTAINLY BE FORTHCOMING FROM THE THOUGHTLESS, OR THE TROUBLEMAKERS, AND IN THESE CICUMSTANCES I HOPE YOU WILL USE YOUR INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY TO MAKE IN PLAIN TO ALL CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC, AND TO ALL THOSE IN NORTHERN IRELAND WITH WHOM YOUR WORDS CARRY WEIGHT THAT THE ONLY COURSE THAT OFFERS ANY HOPE FOR PEACE IN IRELAND IS WHOLE-HEARTED CO-OPERATION WITH THE FORCES OF LAW AND ORDER, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE BORDER. THIS DOES NOT MEAN ANYONE NEED ABANDON HIS VIEWS, BUT IT DOES MEAN ALL MUST FOLLOW YOUR LEAD IN INSISTING THAT PEACE AND JUSTICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS THE IMMEDIATE ISSUE. 
FINALLY I AM SURE YOU WILL RECOGNISEHOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE ACTION WE ARE TAKING SHOULD BE ACCEPTED BY THE PROTESTANT COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND BY PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY OPINION IN BRITAIN. IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC SHOULD BE SEEN TO BE TAKING EFFECTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE I R A. I KNOW THAT THIS A PROBLEM WHICH IS VERY MUCH IN YOUR MIND AND I HOPE THAT, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF OUR NEW INITIATIVE, THERE ARE SOME HELPFUL STEPS WHICH YOU WILL FEEL ABLE TO TAKE. UNQUOTE

I WANT YOU TO KNOW THE BACKGROUND TO THE DECISION MY GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AND TO HAVE THIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF OUR OBJECTIVES. IN RECENT WEEKS MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN EXAMINING AFRESH 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A NEW STARTING POINT FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION. OUR EARLIER EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE RECONCILIATIONS DID NOT BRING ABOUT A LOWERING OF INTER-COMMUNAL TENSIONS AND WE HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED THAT A NEW AND MORE RADICAL EFFORT MUST BE MADE. THE ESSENTIAL MEASURES ON WHICH WE HAVE DECIDED INCLUDE THE TRANSFER OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER FROM STORMONT TO WESTMINISTER: A REVIEW OF ExiSTING INTERNMENT ORDERS SO THAT THE LESS IMPORTANT INTERNEES ARE PROGRESSIVELY RELEASED: THE APPOINTMENT OF A SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AS A MEMBER OF MY GOVERNMENT: AID A SYSTEM OF REGULAR PLEBISCITES ABOUT THE BORDER, THE FIRST TO BE HELD AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND OTHERS AT INTERVALS THEREAFTER. MR FAULKNER AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT, 
ALTHOUGH AGREEING WITH CERTAIN OF THE MEASURES PROPOSED, HAVE DECIDED THAT RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER ONLY TO WESTMINISTER, THEY WOULD PREFER ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO BE TRANSFERRED TO HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOW BEING PUT IN HAND, AND A COMMISSION OF PERSONS RESIDENT IN, AND REPRESENTATIVE OF, NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE APPOINTED TO ADVISE AND ASSIST THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE.

5. The increased burden which this transfer of responsibilities will 
entail means that it will no longer be possible for my right honourable Friend, the Home Secretary, to discharge these duties in addition to his many other responsibilities. A separate Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is therefore being appointed. He will be empowered to appoint a commission of persons resident in Northern Ireland to advise and assist him in the discharge of his duties. 
It will be our objective to invite to serve on this 
commission a body of persons fully representative of opinion in Northern Ireland. 
Internment: 6. 
First Alternative As soon as responsibility has been transferred an immediate review 
will be put in hand by this Government of all internment orders with a view to revoking as many of them as possible consistent with public safety. The Government have taken this decision after consultation with their military advisers. They have also consulted the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who agrees with this course. The pace of releases will depend on the state of public security and the effect upon it of the release of particular internees whose cases are under review. The more quickly terrorist activity by the IRA subsides, the more rapid will be the pace of release; but any increase in IRA activity will delay the process. Internment: Second Alternative 7. 
It is Her Majesty’s Government’s intention to release as soon as 
possible those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt as to the danger to security that their release would pose. Their release will be conditional on an undertaking not to take part in or encourage violence or illegal action. 8. 
It is hoped that upwards of /about/ 100 internees can be said to be 
in this category, and it is hoped to release them during the next few weeks. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is establishing immediately a procedure to review each case personally. 9. 
If the measures which Her Majesty’s Government have taken lead, 
as is hopedthey will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly established improvement in the security situation. 10. 
It is Her Majesty’s Government’s clear intention to bring 
internment to an end, when respect for the law and a normal situation of order have been restored throughout the Province.

11. However, as long as active terrorism persists and bombing and 
shooting continues, Her Majesty’s Government must retain the power to arrest and intern those whom there is good reason to believe are actively involved. 12. 
This Government, and its predecessors, have given solemn and 
repeated assurances that the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom will not be changed without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. We have decided that it would now be appropriate if arrangements were made for the views of the people of Northern Ireland to be made known on this question from time to time. We therefore propose in due course to invite the House to provide for a system of regular plebiscites about the Border, the first to be held as soon as practicable in the near future and others at intervals of a substantial period of years thereafter. The plebiscites will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the provisions in the Ireland Act, 1949, which require the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament to any change in the Border. 13. 
in themselves constitute in the view of Her Majesty’s Government a lasting solution for the problems of Northern Ireland. Means must still be found which will ensure for the whole community an active, permanent and guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of the Province. Our immediate proposals are put forward in the hope that they will so change the climate of political opinion in Northern Ireland that discussions can be resumed in an effort to reach agreement on a new way forward to this end; and it is our intention, as soon as circumstances permit, to promote the necessary consultations about the future structure of Government in Northern Ireland. 14. 
I would like to pay tribute to the strength of conviction with which 
the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has maintained his point of view throughout all our discussions. 
It is a matter of deepest regret to 
Her Majesty’s Government that we were unable to reach a final agreement. In the last resort, however, responsibility rests with the United Kingdom Government and Parliament; and we should be abdicating that responsibility if in this critical situation we did not take the action which we believed to be right. 
These, Mr. Speaker, are our immediate proposals. But they do not

SECRETARY CF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS 
My personal assessment of the Irish Government 
reaction to the three possibilities in telegram No. 98 is as follows:(1) unacceptble for the same reason - too late; 
too little and 
(2) acceptable, because they believe that in practice it would prove not very different from (3); 
(3) would be acceptable. I believe that if the Irish liked the rest of our 
proposals Mr. Lynch would regard periodical referenda as taking care of the reunification question if, without changing the substance of our attitude we were able to phrase it in a slightly more forthcomin manner. However, I must stress that the Irish Government and 
public opinion would regard both (2) and (3) as the necessary preliminary to our tackling the real issue, which in their view is how to obtain a political settlement in which the Catholics need no longer feel they are second class citizens. 
It is this issue which in their 
view will determine whether the bombing and violence cease. There are some indications that the Provisional IRA 
leadership might be prepared to call off the campaign of violence even though their extreme demands 
- the abolition 
of Stormont, the release of all internees and "political prisoners" and the withdraal of the British Army from Northern Ireland 
- were not met.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland I suggest that when you see the Lobby at noon 
tomorrow you take the opportunity to chart the course of the Government’s thinking in recent months. 2. 
You might speak on the following lines:In the first few months following the 
introduction of internment on 9 August the IRA terrorism was fairly effective. 
By November 
however the Army’s tactics began to have an impact. In January the Government were able to contemplate a situation arising in the spring or early summer when the IRA’s hold over the Catholic minority (except in London-derry) would have been loosened to the point where it might have become possible to hold talks of the kind envisaged by the Home Secretary in his statement of 7 September. Londonderry administered a shock to opinion 
throughout Ireland. This, and the sequel at Newry, created a new situation in which direct intervention by H.M. Government became a possibility. Ministers therefore set to work urgently to 
consider whether this possibility was real and if so how it could best be exploited. 
Early in the 
process which then ensued Ministers came to the conclusion that the effect of Londonderry on public opinin made it not only possible but in fact desirable for the Government to intervene. 
The 
post-Londonderry situation provided an opportunity by direct intervention to break the circle of violence and make a new start.

Northern Ireland Counter Proposals The Stormont system would remain, subject to the 
following adjustments:(i) Internment. 
It is agreed that a beginning 
should be made with a phasing out of internment, which would continue subject to a satisfactory diminution of violence. The categories for this phasing out will be agreed by the Joint Security Committee, which will be augmented by a United Kingdom Minister, who will be joint chairman of the Committee with the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs; each of these joint chairmen will have a right of veto; 
The formal authority 
in connection with internment, whether for purposes of release or future internment, will continue to rest with the Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs; and the representative of the United Kingdom Government will be associated with him in the decisions on individual cases. 
(ii) The Special Powers Act will be replaced by fresh legislation enacted at Stormont providing that in future emergency measures, including internment, may not be instituted except after the proclamation of an Emergency which will require the approval of the United Kingdom Secretary of State. This legislation could be introduced now; but it would not take effect until the current emergency is over.

The main points which you may wish to put to the Cabinet tomorrow 
are, I think, as follows:(i) 
The decision which the Cabinet took at their last meeting i. e. the transfer of law and order from Stormont to Westminster 
(ii) - has been communicated to Mr. Faulkner. 
Mr. Faulkner has rejected it on the grounds that it would imply a fundamental lack of confidence in his Administration; that the Government of Northern Ireland would cease to be a Government in any real sense; and that the change would be universally seen as a victory by the IRA. He has said thateven though he would intensely dislike direct rule and could not guarantee how he would react to it, he would regard it as less unacceptable than the transfer of law and order. At the same time he has made counter proposals as in the annexed document. 
(Copies are available to be handed round during the Cabinet.) (iii) 
The Cabinet must now decide whether they regard these counter proposals as:- 
(a) 
adequate in substancebearing in mind that internment and security would be only joint functions, with no certainty that the will of the United Kingdom Government would prevail; and that the "further constitutional changes" which the Northern Ireland Government envisage would not in fact guarantee the minority an effective share in the government and administration of the Province as of right; 
(b) 
convincing in presentation, bearing in mind that the whole purpose of HMG’s policy at this moment is to win back the minority to active participation in the discussion of Northern Ireland’s future, and to induce Mr. Lynch to take more effective action against the IRA in the South.

Northern Ireland Counter Proposals 
Internment The Northern Ireland Government have proposed the following 
statement:"The Governments of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland have decided to make an immediate gesture in the interests of an early end to violence and a resumption of normal, constructive political activity in Northern Ireland. 
The Advisory Committee on Internment have been reviewing internment cases and recommending release where, because of a change in attitude, there is considered to be no appreciable degree of risk. 
The two Governments have now agreed that, from amongst those of the internees whose release has not been recommended, but who are recognised by the security forces as constituting a lesser degree of risk [x] should forthwith be released as an earnest of the desire to reverse the entire cycle of violence and the counter-measures taken to deal with it. 
The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and the Home Secretary will from now on meet at regular intervals to assess the situation, and - taking into account in particular any appreciable de-escalation of violence, but also any moves by other sections and groups to normalise public life - will consider together when and in what numbers further internees of lower risk rating may be released. 
It will of course be the intention when violence 
has clearly come to an end to wind down any remaining internment as rapidly as this can safely be done.

22 March 1972 We spoke this morning on the telephone about the proposed 
submission and statement annexed to your letter of 21 March; and just before the meeting with Mr Faulkner started, I was able to hand Peter Gregson the suggested revision of the draft statement which has been approved by the Secretary of State for Defence. 
I enclose, for the record, a copy of this suggested 
revision; and I also enclose a redraft of the covering submission in which the amendments that we would like to see made are sidelined. 
May I take the opportunity to emphasise the following 
points:a. 
In the view of the Secretary of State and CGS, it is essential that a statement about the rundown of internment should be made as part of the "package" and that it should be a statement which will make a convincing impact: this involves a risk which has to be accepted: anything which does not go as far as the revised statement which we now suggest is unlikely to have an adequate impact on the situation. 
b. Gregson. 
It is important to retain an oath or declaration as a condition of release,for the reasons setout in the revised draft submission.

RUNDOWN OF INTERMENT A possible statement by the Secretary of State for 
Northern Ireland on the rundown of internment is attached at the annex. 
It is proposed that this statement should 
form part of the main statement of HMG’s political initiative.. As to the machinery of review, it seems desirable that it should be administrative rather than judicial. 
The 
latter would not be sufficiently responsive to a fast moving situation. 
If that is agreed, it is important 
not to lose sight of the fact that neither releases from internment nor internment orders themselves are pure acts of policy. 
If an internment order depends on the 
individual concerned being a danger to public security, then his release must imply that that danger is no longer present. 
some new situation arises, ie that he himself re-engages in illegal activity or that the general situation has deteriorated. 
public statements made about the review. This means that he cannot be reinterned unless 
But it also implies a need for care in any If in fact the 
category C. internees are all about equal from the point of view of danger to the public safety, then the moment some of them are released the continued detention of the others in category C. is called into question. 
This 
seems to mean that the matter will have to be dealt with on a strictly individual basis, and it also means that only general conditions can be applied to the continued rundown of internment. 
These dangers are somewhat mitigated

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
mitigated by the fact that it is unreasonable to suppose that all the least dangerous internees can be released at once. 
Each case will have to be reviewed and the time 
that that takes may provide the spacing necessary. The machinery might consist of a review by the staff 
of the Northern Ireland Office of individual cases with the object of dividing category C. into those who can be released as part of the initial release and those who cannot. 
The Chief Constable and the GOC would be given 
the opportunity to comment on each case just before the revocation orders were submitted for signature, so that the local situation can be taken into account in relation to each man released. 
the releases. The oath or declaration that has hitherto been 
required of internees released on the recommendation of Judge Brown has been objected to on the ground that it implies that the person concerned has been concerned in the past in terrorist activities. 
The oath runs as follows:- 
"I swear by Almighty God that for the remainder of my life I will not join nor assist any illegal organisation nor engage in any violence nor counsel nor encourage others so to do." The requiring of such an oath by internees has a long 
history on both sides of the border; and the RUC Special Branch whose members are most at risk, would be greatly concerned if it were abandoned. modified 
It could, however, be This process will help to space out

modified by the addition of words such as "This oath does not imply any admission by me that I have been concerned in such activities in the past". Such an oath or declaration is important for two 
reasons. Firstin order to counter the accusation from the RUC and others that we are releasing men who have given no undertaking that they would not immediately rejoin the active ranks ofthe IRA. 
Secondly, that if in fact 
they do so, the case for re-interning them is very much stronger.

however, raise the question whether the releases should be conditional or absolute. 
Regulation 12 already empowers 
the Minister of Home Affairs to make conditions of residence and reporting to the police and the like as an alternative to internment. 
If we took over internment, we could 
further modify the Regulation (and indeed it is understood that the Northern Ireland Government themselves had the possibility of a provision for conditional release in mind in any revision of the Regulations). 
But if under the 
existing Regulation internment were converted to a residence and reporting condition in the case of individuals it would seem to carry the advantage that the individuals would not cease to be persons judged to be a danger to public safety. 
Whether conditions would be enforceable 
(there is a penalty of 6 months imprisonment) is another question

It is HMG’s intention to release as soon as possible 
those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt as to the danger to security that their release would pose. 
Their release will be conditional on an undertaking 
not to take part in or encourage violence or illegal action. It is hoped that upwards of [about] 100 internees can 
be said to be in this category, and it is hoped to release them during the next few weeks. 
The S of S for Northern 
Ireland is establishing immediately a procedure to review each case personally. If the measures which HMG have taken lead, as is hoped 
they will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly established improvement in the security situation. It is HMG’s clear intention to bring internment to an 
end, when respect for the law and a normal situation of order have been restored throughout the Province. However, as long as active terrorism persists and 
bombing and shooting continues, HMG must retain the power to arrest and intern those whom there is good reason to believe are actively involved.

6. A report, which is being checked, has been received that the Ulster 
Vanguard is thinking of organising a strike at Harland and Wolff on 13 and 14 April. (Mr Craig has occasionally spoken of ’lightning’ strikes by Vanguard members.) 
There is still some resentment amongst Protestants at recent 
developments, and officials are paying special attention to the maintenance of morale in the RUC Special Branch. 
7. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will be considering the release 
of some more internees later this week. REPORT OF THE WIDGERY TRIBUNAL 8. 
The Report seems to establish that the soldiers were fired at before they 
opened fire themselves, and in general acted reasonably, but it does make one or two remarks that could be used by those anxious to exaggerate any shortcomings in the Army’s conduct. Subject tothe outcome of discussions between Ministers today the Ministry of Defence will prepare drafts for a possible statement on the Report which will be discussed between the interested Departments. The timing of publication will be considered at the same time.

bomb placed in a parked furniture van near the hotel exploded causing minor structural damage to the building. In another bomb incident in Belfast on Saturday a 50

parked lorry beside the Windsor Park Football Ground grandstand exploded causing structural damage to the stands. 5. 
There were four demonstrations on Sunday in Belfast but no 
violence occurred. The largest was a pro-Republican rally in Andersonstown attended by 1,700 which called for an end to internment. At about the same time 200 Protestant women marched on Crumlin Gaol in protest against the release of internees. An IRA commemoration serviceat Milltown Cemetery was attended by 500. 6. 
There were several minor incidents of intersectarian violence. 
In Belfast on Saturday 25 shots were fired from the Catholic Rodney Parade into the Protestant Tates Avenue. The Protestantsbuilt barricades which were removed by the security forces. In another incident in Belfast on the same day a Catholic youth fired a pistol at a RUC patrol checking a bonfire. A crowd of 400 formed but soon dispersed. 40 youths in Belfast on Saturday stoned each other but were dispersed by vigilantes and security force patrols. 7.

Northern Ireland Office Note of a meeting at 10 a.m. on 7 April 1. The interdepartmental meetings which have taken place in the Ministry 
of Defence, chaired by Sir James Dunnett, have been discontinued. In future meetings will be held in the Northern Ireland Office chaired by Mr Cairncross. Notes of the meetings will be circulated to those listed in Annex B. A daily report on the security situation in Northern Ireland will continue to be circulated by the Ministry of Defence. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
With the security forces not being active in the Roman Catholic enclaves, 
and adopting in general a ’lower profile’ the Director of Intelligence has reported that less information is being obtained from people arrested. This is to be expected. He has drawn attention to the risk that morale in the RUC Special Branch might deteriorate if the terrorist campaign continues during these developments, but has reported no sign of it doing so yet. The future plans of both the Ulster Vanguard and the IRA (Provisional) continue to be uncertain. SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
Although the number of incidents of terrorism is much the same, attacks 
are being pressed home with less determination. The Army is studying further ways of ’lowering its profile’ and improving its relations with the community. INTERNMENT 4. 
The Secretary of State announced today the release of 47 internees and 
26 detainees, which will enable HMS Maidstone no longer to be used as a place of detention. The present members of the advisory committee on internment have agreed to stay on only until 14 April and possible replacements are being considered.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A STATEMENT MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MR WILLIAM WHITELAW, AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN STORMONT CASTLE ON FRIDAY 7 APRIL 1972 
A few days ago, when I first came here I called for an end to violence and asked for everyone to work for peace. 
Since then on all sides I have been struck by the will to end this tragic period in Northern Ireland’s history and to move forward again. 
I have been encouraged by the willingness to think again by those who may have reacted strongly to the measures which were so recently taken by Her Majesty’s Government. Equally I have been impressed by the courage of those who have been prepared to speak up against the law of the gun. 
So it is right that you should ask what My contribution is going to be. 
Without doubt a key issue is internment. Let no-one be under any illusion. The people who are behind the wire were put there because of the dangerous situation confronting this community in the recent past. 
But in this new mood of peace and reconciliation I have now decided it would be right for me to release some of the men interned immediately. 
As I promised I have begun to review personally the cases of the 728 people still interned under the Special Powers Act. This of course takes time. Initially I have looked at those cases which the security authorities have advised might be considered for early release and last night I signed Orders authorising the release of 47 internees. It did not seem to me to be right to delay the release of any internees until I had been able to complete my review of every case. I shall now proceed as quickly as possible to review the remaining cases and intend to authorise the release of any whom I consider suitable as soon as I have completed each one. 
The internees released today were not asked to give an undertaking about their future behaviour.

In addition to the internees, 26 men who were detained under Regulation 11 of the Special Powers Act have been released today. A total of 73 men. 
s this process continues I ant the men I can release to get back to their wives and families as soon as possible. For this reason I hope to see a steady trend back to normality rather than a series of jerky steps. Figures for the number of men going out of internment will be issued regularly by my department although no doubt the news of individual returns will be known quicker by their local communities. 
The conditions aboard the Maidstone have also been worrying me - although here I must stress that I do not accept the charges that are being made. 
But reports I have received from officials at the Home Affairs department and from the military have convinced me that a ship is not suitable for such 
a purpose. I have therefore decided that the ship will cease to be a reception centre for detainees. 
A number of detainees from the Maidstone are of course included in the figures I have already announced for release. But within the next few days I hope it will be possible to say that no men are held upon the ship. 
I have also arranged that in future men who have a genuine reason for parole while my review is taking place 
- to attend a funeral, for example - 
allowed to stay out for twice the present period. From three days, to six days. 
I hope to be lenient in other domestic circumstances too. This week, for example, a man was permitted to leave internment to attend a double wedding and I was glad to authorise it. 
ill be

I hope that today’s releases may here.ld the beginning of a phasing-out of internment but I must place on record once more that in considering the cases of internees I must have regard to the current security situation. It would be quite wrong to release men who might encourage an upsurge of violence against the security forces or the community in general. But I now believe that the great majority of those who share my wish to see internment phased-out, also share my concern that violence should cease. 
This then is my contribution at this early stage to a reduticn in tension. I hope it will be regarded as an encouragement by those who are working for peace. 
I can point the direction - a return to normality but it is the people of Northern Ireland themselves who in large part must determine how far and how fast we move to that dfstination.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND LABOUR PARTY HAVE 
DECIDED TO BE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THE ADVISORY COMMISSION. THIS, IN ADDITION TO THEIR RESPONSIBLE REACTION GENERALLY TO YOUR PROPOSALS, IS A HAPPY AUGURY. WITH THE SPEEDY ENDING OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL THE WAY WOULD BE CLEAR FOR THE S D L P AND THE NATIONALIST PARTY TO ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSIONS YOU ENVISAGE IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AGREEMENT ON A NEW WAY FORWARD. 
I HOPE IT WILL LATER BECOME POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO REFLECT AGAIN 
ON THE PROPOSAL FOR A SYSTEM OF REGULAR PLEBISCITES IN THE NORTH ABOUT THE BORDER. I SHOULD BE LESS THAN FRANK IN THIS MESSAGE IF I DID NOT LET YOU KNOW OF MY RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS IDEA ON GROUNDS BOTH OF PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICE. OF PRINCIPLE, BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF IRISH UNITY CANNOT BE SETTLED SOLELY WITHIN THE BORDERS OF NORTHERN IRELAND: AND OF PRACTICE, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE ADVENT OF THE PLEBISCITORY PERIOD WOULD, ON EACH OCCASION, LEAD TO RENEWED POLARISATION OF THE COMMUNITIES AND ALMOST CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER AND PROBABLY ON BOTH. IT IS MY ABIDING VIEW, OF COURSE, THAT IRISH UNITY MUST PROPERLY BE OBTAINED BY AGREEMENT: TO THIS I HAVE ADDED MY BELIEF THAT OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS SHOULD, EACH IN ITS DOMAIN, MUTUALLY PREPARE THE GROUND FOR OBTAINING THE AGREEMENT OF THE NORTH. THIS WILL BE A DELICATE TASK AND WILL TAKE TIME. A SOFTENING OF OPINION AMONG THE MAJORITY, WHICH WILL BE A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF MY POLICY, IS WHAT WE SEEK. PROGRESS IN THIS WAY COULD BE SERIOUSLY DISRUPTED BY A HARDENING OF ATTITUDES AT EACH PLEBISCITORY PERIOD. HOWEVER THESE ARE MATTERS WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHEN NEXT WE MEET. 
I AM SENDING YOU THIS MESSAGE THROUGH THE AMBASSADOR WHOM I WAS GLAD TO INSTRUCT TO RETURN TO HIS POST LAST FRIDAY.

I understand that the Social Democratic and Labour Party have decided to be available immediately for informal discussions about the formation of the Advisory Commission. This, in addition to their responsible reaction generally to your proposals, is a happy augury. 
With the speedy 
ending of internment without trial the way would be clear for the SDLP and the Nationalist Party to engage in the discussions you envisage in an effort to reach agreement on a new way forward. 
I hope it will later become possible for you to reflect again on the proposal for a system of regular plebiscites in the North about the Border. 
I should be less than frank 
in this message if I did not let you know of my reservations about this idea on grounds both of principle and practice. Of principle, because the question of Irish unity cannot be settled solely within the borders of Northern Ireland; and of practice, because I believe that the advent of the plebiscitory period would, on each occasion, lead to renewed polarisation of the communities and almost certainly encourage violence on one side or the other and probably on both. 
It is my abiding view, of course, that Irish unity 
must properly be obtained by agreement; to this I have added my belief that our two Governments should, each in its domain, mutually prepare the ground for obtaining the agreement of the North. will take time. 
This will be a delicate task and A softening of opinion among the majority, 
which will be a primary function of my policy, is what we seek. 
Progress in this way could be seriously disrupted 
by a hardening of attitudes at each plebiscitory period. However these are matters which we can talk about when next we meet. I am sending you this message through the Ambassador whom I was glad to instruct to return to his post last Friday.

Clearly the Army must remain free to fire on gunmen and bombers and to use CS gas and rubber bullets against hooligans. They must also be permitted to be as tough with Protestant hooligans henceforward as they have been with Catholic hooligans in the past. But what is to be their policy as regards e. g. searching of premises for men on the "wanted list" as known or suspected members of the IRA? Should the "wanted list" be reviewed (like the list of internees) in order to separate active terrorists from those who may have done little more than aid and abet? What should the Army do when they receive information (which may or may not be accurate) that a man on the "wanted list" can be found at a certain address? Should they search the premises, with the risk of provoking fresh antagonism if the search is fruitlessor should they rely on the chance of picking up "wanted" men when they come out into the open and actually commit acts of terrorism? 
5. There are several other questions which it may be convenient to 
deal with tomorrow, if there is time:(i) The arrangements for the immediate appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, which the Attorney General is anxious to complete by Thursday evening. 
(ii) The appointment of the Advisory Commissionon which the Lord President should put forward proposals as quickly as possible.

(iii) The scope and timing of the first releases of internees, where it might be useful to ask the Lord President if he has yet been able to give any thought to the procedure for initiating a review. Sooner or later the Government will be challenged in Parliament about the criteria governing the rate of release and the selection of individuals; and we ought to decide these as soon as possible. 
(iv) The cratering of Border roads, where the Lord President is inclined to favour some degree of unobtrusive relaxation, particularly if there are grounds for hoping that this might lead to closer co-operation between the RUC and the Gardai. Mr. Lynch’s reply to your message suggests that he might be responsive to a discreet gesture of this kind. 
It might be helpful if the Commission could be

The idea of an independent Northern Ireland was, he said, In his first reaction to the proposals announced on 24 March Mr Craig 
said he would deplore any co-operation being given to their implementation, and asked the Northern Ireland Government to call a general election. 
The 
policy of Ulster Vanguard would be to demonstrate continuously that the British Government governed Northern Ireland by an imposed constitution against the wishes of the majority, and to seek a new constitution that would enable the people of Northern Ireland "to actively counter....all who would by force....submerge us in an Irish republic against the wishes of the majority". But he asked for calm, and urged co-operation in the call for a two-day strike beginning on 27 March (see also paragraphs 23 and 25).

A spokesman for the Provisionals in Dublin (Sean Stephenson) "completely and totally rejected" the Government’s proposals on 24 March, and a statement issued by the Provisionals repeated the demands made on 10 March (see HONIP(72) 11 Paragraph 6)The commander of the Belfast Provisionals (Seamus Twomey) said that there was no question of any truce, and that he believed the rank and file He warned the SDLP

16. In Londonderry, however, the Provisional command said attacks on civilian targets would stop for four weeks throughout Northern Ireland. statements from Dublin and Londonderry have repudiated this. 
17. The Official IRA have said that the Government’s proposals are a change for the worse in that they constitute a reduction in democracy in Northern Ireland.

18. On 24 March Mr Lynch said that the British Government’s proposals were a step forward. 
They should be considered maturely and objectively, with the 
aim of making it possible for all Irishmen to find a new way forward towards a society in which peace, justice, understanding and friendship would prevail. The Irish Ambassador to London was returning immediately to his post (he had been withdrawn after the shootings in Londonderry on 30 January).

Note of a meeting at noon on 12 May 
ALLEGATIONS OF ILL-TREATMENT The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has decided that the 
normal police procedures for investigating allegations will continue to be used. The Chief Constable has been asked to furish the Secretary of State with reports on the progress of all such investigations, and, with particular urgency, those into allegations submitted by Father Faul. The Northern Ireland Office will obtain copies of such reports. 2. 
It seems likely to emerge that the people making the allegations are 
refusing to give evidence to the police who investigate them. It will not always be the case that such a refusal will mark the end of any investigation: other information might be available, and investigations hould continue until the point is reached when no reasonable person would say they should be taken further. But whenever investigations come to an end the results and the reasons for them (including any refusals to co-operate) should be publicised. 3. 
The ’Sunday Times’ have not yet been reminded of their commitment to 
send to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the evidence for their article last Sunday on three cases of alleged brutality. The Northern Ireland Office is considering what might be arranged today. 4. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked for a note on the 
methods of interrogation use d by the RUC. This has a bearing on evidence that can be produced in criminal proceedings, as well as the production of intelligence The Ministry of Defence will be kept in touch. INTELLIGENCE 5. 
There have been reports of recruiting by both wings of the IRA, and that about twelve released internees are active again. The Provisional command in

Northern Ireland The agenda for tomorrow’s meeting might best be grouped under the 
three main headings of security; short-term policy; and long-term policy. A. 
Security (1) 
Violence Lord Balniel and the CGS should be invited to give the usual weekly 
report on the level of violence. (2) 
Brutality The Secretary of State and Lord Balniel should be asked to report 
the result of their further enquiries into the renewed allegations of brutality during arrest and detention. The Attorney General might also be asked whether there is any change in the position as regards the civil claims for wrongful arrest or ill-treatment, particularly in the light of the potentially damaging effect on the morale of the RUC of a continuing failure to obtain convictions. (3) Internment The Secretary of State was asked at the last meeting to consider the 
possibility of accelerating the release of, at any rate, a proportion of the internees more rapidly than the process of individual examination would permit. He might be invited to say how far this is proving to be practicable and desirable. (4) Intelligence As I reported the other day I have arranged for the Secretary of State 
and his officials to discuss with MI5 and MI6 the possibility of creating new sources of intelligence 
I hope that the Secretary of State 
will meet the agencies concerned this evening; and, if so, he should be able to report the upshot tomorrow. 
B. Short-term policy (1) 
Political How is the Secretary of State getting on as regards:- 
(a) The Advisory Commission. (b) The creation of machinery in the Parliament at Westminster for discussion of Northern Ireland business. 
(c) The plebiscite on the Border.

1st May. 1972 Northern Ireland Now that we have entered a new phase of our relationship with 
Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister is anxious that, henceforward, the meetings of GEN 79, starting with the first tomorrow afternoon, should tackle the problems systematically on each occasion by grouping them under their main headings and establishing, for each group, a kind of "check list" of points to be dealt with. The final form of this check list must perhaps be allowed to emerge from the first few discussions in the new series of GEN 79 meetings; but, in outline, it might be on the following lines:- 
(1) The security situation. Under this heading the meeting should deal with, inter alia:- 
(a) The current level of violence. 
(b) The disposition of the security forces, including any changes in the strength of Army units which it is possible to contemplate in relation to e.g. the "no go" areas. 
(c) Internment and detention policy. Your Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Defence will 
no doubt indicate if there are other items under this heading which they would wish to raise as a matter of regular routine. 
(2) The short term political situation. This group might comprise:- 
(a) Northern Ireland legislation requiring action at Westminster. (b) The progress of the reforms in 
e.g. local government, etc. 
(c) The state of the Northern Ireland economy, together with any proposals for economic assistance.

Northern Ireland: Situation and Prospects (GEN 79(72) 4) 
I have indicated to the members of the group, as you suggested, that 
GEN 79 meetings should henceforward deal with the questions involved by grouping them, so far as possible, under three main headings and establishing for each group a kind of standard "check list" which could be used as the basis of discussion on each occasion. We should perhaps avoid finalising the precise form of this "check list" until we have had the first meeting or two in the new series; but thereafter it should be incorporated in the agenda for each meeting. A provisional grouping might be as follows: The Security Situation 
(1) 
(a) The current level of violence. (b) The disposition of the security forces, including any changes 
in the strength of Army units which it is possible to contemplate in relation to e.g. the "no go" areas. (2) The Short-term Political Situation (a) Northern Ireland legislation requiring action at Westminster. (b) Internment and detention policy. (c) The progress of the reforms in e.g. local government, etc. (d) The state of the Northern Ireland economy, together with any proposals for economic assistance. (3) 
The Long-term Constitutional Solution (a) The means by which long-term constitutional proposals would 
best be devised. (b) The progress in working them out. (c) The method and timing of their ultimate implementation. If this format is adopted in principle, the discussion of GEN 79(72) 4 
might follow the same order. (1) 
The Security Situation In the light of paragraph 6 of the Secretary of State’s memorandum 
the CGS might be asked to report on the current level of violence and on the disposition and tactics of the security forces. 
This would lead on to a

(2) The Short-term Political Situation The Secretary of State recognises (paragraph 12) that to maintain a 
middle-of-the-road policy "will in the immediate future demand, almost day to day, the taking of political initiatives in the field of law and order with corresponding public relations activity whilst maintaining a sound administration and a dynamic programme of legislation on social and economic regeneration". The specific measures which he has in mind in this context appear to comprise the rundown of internment as rapidly as possible; action designed to show "that we are determined to give the minority the opportunity for full participation in public life"; an increasing disengagement of the Army; steady progress with the legislative programme of social reform; and vigorous measures of economic and social reconstruction. Each of these topics deserves a short discussion to itself; and it will be particularly interesting to elicit the Secretary of State’s detailed proposals as regards the rate of rundown of internment and disengagement of the Army, further measures of political and social reform (including the establishment of the Advisory Commission) and a possible programme of economic reconstruction. He may also wish to comment on the proposal to create some form of committee machinery in the Parliament at Westminster to deal with Northern Ireland legislation, on which he is in touch with the Lord President and the Chief Whip in connection with discussions which are already in train through Parliamentary channels. (3) The Long-term Constitutional Solution The Secretary of State maintains 
- rightly, I think - that "an 
acceptable settlement can only arise out of and will be shaped by, the actual course of events in Northern Ireland over the coming months; and practical decisions on the ground will be a predominant fact in determining whether an acceptable settlement can be found. This means that background thinking must be in close touch with decision-taking on the spot". He proposes, therefore, to set up a small nucleus in his office in London in order "to prepare for the future". 
It would be interesting to know rather more about this proposal - in particular 
about the size of the proposed unit, the nature of its staff and the sources on which it will draw. Without prejudice to the Secretary of State’s insistence that long-term thinking must be organically related to current

Dr Hillery called on the Secretary of State on Thursday 27 April. Mr McCann (PUS to Dr Hillery), Dr O’Sullivan, the Irish Ambassador, Sir William Nield and Mr Trevelyan (Northern Ireland Office) and Sir Stewart Crawford (FCO) were present. 
The Secretary of State welcomed Dr Hillery who asked what were his impressions of Londonderry on his recent visit. The Secretary of State said that there were undoubtedly fears of Protestant reaction but that signs, such as the recent incident in the Waterside area, had been much exaggerated. He added that he had been encouraged by response from the Catholic community so far and hoped that the most recent releases from internment, including Sean Keenan, would help further. 
The Secretary of State said thathe intended to announce the lifting of the ban on marches later in the day together with an amnesty which would cover, amongst others, Miss Devlin and Mr McManus. He was considering the difficult problem of the "hard core" of internees and would welcome advice on how these people, some of whom had been involved in considerable violence, might best be treated. 
Dr Hillery said that Mr Lynch, who had asked him to make this visit, was anxious to help in the new situation which he described as something of a vacuum so far as normal political activity was concerned. It would be important to guide the IRA and other militant groups into politics. From the point of view of the South there was also the problem of bringing moderate middle opinion in the North to take a more open-minded view of the prospects of an eventual united Ireland. Mr Lynch could make a statement in the fairly near future which, if this seemed helpful, might indicate possibilities of constitutional change on the part of the Republic which made it easier for North and South to come together. Would it be useful to initiate contacts at official level, in particular on economic problems? One of the results of internment had been to remove a number of people who might have helped with a transition to politics by the IRA. This was not so much the case in Londonderry where Mr Hume seemed to carry considerable weight but did appear to be so in Belfast where many of those now involved were teenagers who could not easily be controlled by the truncated leadership.

The Secretary of State said that he welcomed Mr Lynch’s intention to influence the situation. He was naturally much concerned at the moment by the difficult problem of reassuring moderate Protestant opinion in the North after the introduction of direct rule. He would, of course, be studying with his colleagues the future constitutional development and would be interested in Dr Hillery’s reaction to the proposal for a plebiscite. Dr Hillery said that it was regarded with suspicion in Ireland, and as something which might delay unification. The fear was that the British would go away, hand the country back to the Unionists and everyone would be back to square one. The idea of integration which was being canvassed by some would mean continuing violence in Ireland and the risk of importing it into Britain. Reassurances about the Government’s intentions would be very necessary on this point. 
The Secretary of State said that the situation since direct rule was in fact radically different and he hoped increasingly to get this point across. Under an impartial administration, for example, and with reform of local government which he intended to pursue, the coming local elections in October would provide an opportunity for political activity quite different from the past. The Government would deal with all local authorities on exactly the same basis. Furthermore, the new area boards in such important fields as education and health would comprise appointed members up to 60 or 70% and the Government would have major influence there. On the security front anything which the Government of the Republic could do to reassure moderate Catholic opinion in the North would be invaluable; an example would be that we had no intention whatever of mopping up suspects in the Bogside and the Creggan in a major army operation if these areas were to open up. We would be much more interested in trying to build up a police force perhaps by a local reserve which might be linked with the RUC. He would gladly consider the possibility of official contacts but this might be best pursued a little later. Any statement by Mr Lynch about constitutional changes in the Republic would be most helpful if made unilaterally. The Government could then take note of it in its own actions, without the necessity for public commitments, on the basis of a common understanding. 
The Secretary of State said that in his examination of internees he would be helped by information from Irish sources about people whose release might be useful in Belfast. Dr Hillery said this could be looked into.

remind the Irish Government that we have taken risks and that it is up to then to support us by clear action, and not merely words, South of the Border - 
i.e. to 
fulfil. their part of the "barain." Mr. Lynch in commenting, showed that he accepted this (Sir John Peck’s teleram is at Annex G).

Shooting of McCann 
Widgery If a reasonable atmosphere is achieved, Dr. Hillery is unlikely to indulge in recriminations on either (e) or (f). If the reference of the McCann case the DPP is raised, the answer must be that the affair is now sub judice.

SECRET TO IMMEDIATE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE TELNO 003 OF 25 APRIL INFO FCO, DUBLIN 
FOLLOWING FOR TREVELYAN. 1. THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE TO MR LYNCH (FCO TEL NO. 118 TO DUBLIN) IS CLEARLY A BASIC DOCUMENT FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S MEETING WITH DR. HILLERY. I ASSUME THAT MR WHITELAW WOULD WISH TO BEGIN BY GIVING HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE POSITION FOUR WEEKS AFTER HIS ENTERING INTO OFFICE. WHEN THE DECISION WAS TAKEN TO IMPOSE UNITED KINGDOM RULE IT WAS RECKONED THAT THE IRA WOULD MAKE A STRONG EFFORT TO FRUSTRATE POLICIES OF RECONCILIATION, AND THAT PROTESTANT BITTERNESS MIGHT WELL LEAD TO SERIOUS TROUBLE FROM THEIR SIDE. THE PICTURE SO FAR HAS BEEN LESS UNFAVOURABLE THAN WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE PROTESTANT SUSPICIONS AND BITTERNESS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY DEEP BUT THE PROTESTANTS HAVE, WITH ONLY A FEW EXCEPTIONS, REFRAINED FROM VIOLENCE THE IRA HAVE CONTINUED THEIR POLICY OF VIOLENCE, NO DOUBT TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY, 
AND WE MUST EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT 
DAMAGE THEY CAN: BUT THE DESIRE OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CATHOLICS TO SEE VIOLENCE ENDED HAS BEEN EVIDENT AND IMPRESSIVE. NEVERTHELESS THE SITUATION IS FULL OF UNCERTAINTIES AND WE MUST EXPECT DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TIMES AHEAD. DESPITE MANY PRESSURES THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS STUCK TO THE POLICY OF RUNNING DOWN INTErNMENT. HE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT WHAT HE CAN DO MUST DEPEND IN LARGE DEGREE ON WHAT THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY AND OTHERS CAN DO TO ISCLATE AND THUS DEFEAT THE IRA. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS KEENLY AWARE THAT MEASURES IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS WELL NEED TO BE TAKEN, OF A KIND WHICH WILL GIVE CONFIDENCE TO ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY AND HOPEFULLY, TO ENCOURAGE THEM TOWARDS A GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY. 
HE IS GIVING URGENT THOUGHT TO THE CRUCIAL PROBLEM OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING MEASURES WHICH WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT, ESPECIALLY ON THE YOUNG UNEMPLOYED. 2. MR WHITELAW MIGHT WISH TO SAY THAT WHILE RECOGNISING, AND APPRECIATING, THE WELCOME THAT WAS GIVEN IN THE REPUBLIC TO HMG’S DECISION AND THE EVIDENT WISH THERE THAT THE INITIATIVE SHOULD SUCCEED, HE BELIEVES THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THESE ATTITUDES

Note of a meeting held on 25 April 
SECURITY SITUATION Shooting incidents continue to be many and explosions few. More shooting 
incidents than usual have been unexplained, possibly reflecting the increased tension between the communities which was evidenced by disturbances in Londonderry over the weekend. The barricades put up in the Waterside area then were removed yesterday as a result of peaceful persuasion. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The Director of Intelligence has reported a deterioration in relations 
between the two communities and increased evidence of Protestant extremists trying to procure arms. 
Although there is still a feeling amongst Roman Catholics 
that the violence should end, practical support continues to be given to the IRA. CIVIL PROCEEDINGS 3. 
The settlement by which damages were awarded to 16 people who have been 
interned has not attracted much unfavourable comment. The claims were based on alleged treatment at Ballykinlar (during the ’exercises’) and Long Kesh (during disturbances there). 4.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 210700 hrs to 240700 hrs APR 72 GENERAL 1. 
The 72 hour period ending at 0700 hrs on Monday 24 April saw the first 
sign in Londonderry of the emergence of a Protestant reaction to the continuing situation in the BOGSIDE and CREGGAN: Protestant barricades were erected in the WATERSIDE area of LONDONDERRY. There were 24 minor instances of intersection activity throughout the province and a higher than usual level of unexplained shooting incidents. During the period there were 104 shooting incidents (in 29 of which Security Forces ore not involved and in 34 of which Scurity Forces returned fire) and 8 bomb explosions. 
2. On Friday21 April there were five explosions throughout the Province 
and a bomb on the border was neutralised with the cooperation of the Gardai. The current high rate of shooting incidents continued with 17 in BELFAST and 14 in LONDONDERRY. There were three Security Forces casualties, one serious; four terrorists are believed hit. On Saturday 22 April the number of shootig incidents was again high - 13 in BELFAST and 14 in LONDONDERRY, but only two explosions. The LAW meeting of 250 Protestants addressed by GlennBARR in LONDONDERRY failed to reach WILLIAM St after the intervention of the RUC, bit followingits dispersion across the FOYLE intersecterian strife flared up in IRISH St. Three barricades were built in the Protestant estate. The Northern Resistance Movement (NRM) rally at LONG KESH addressed by FARRELL, DEVLIN, BOYDE, McMANUS, HUNTER attracted only 120. On Sunday 23 April the two communities in the WATERSIDE of LONDONDERRY were again at loggerheads after a quiet night. The Catholics erected a barricade in IRISH St and stoning of the Security Forces continued with the military trying to keep a low profile. The Official Republican Convention in BELFAST in a DIVIS St building went off without incidents. There were shooting incidents in BELFAST, 19 shooting incidents in BELFAST, 13 in LONDONDERRY, and only 1 explosion overall. Hooligansism was at its normal high weekend level. 4 Security Forces and 3 civilians were wounded. 3 hits are claimed.

NIOM (72) 4 Note of a meeting held on l8 April 
INTELLIGENCE It is tnought that an Active Service Unit coming from the Irish Republic 
and consisting of six members of the Official IRA was responsible for the shooting attack in the Divis area of Belfast yesterday. 2. 
The Director of Intelligence-reports that both factions of the IRA have now 
succeeded in giving the impression that they wish the campaign of violence to go on. Some of the recent violence may be designed to make it more difficult to release internees, but the shooting of McCann (a leading member of the Officials) is being used by the Officials as an excuse for violence in ’retaliation’ His funeral is this afternoon. (Also see paragraph 5). OPERATIONS 3. 
The recent level of shooting attacks has been high, and the rate of Army 
casualties has not dropped in spite of the ’low profile’ currently being adopted. 4. 
Ways in which the Army could broaden its activities by contributing to civil 
projects are being considered with a view to this being further discussed in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office in London will also be kept in touch. DEATH OF McCANN 5. 
The IRA are reported to have claimed that McCann was responsible for the 
death of fifteen British soldiers. He was shot by the Army after he had evaded arrest and taken no heed of warnings. Replies to press enquiries about the incident will concentrate on giving the facts and, sofar as possible, avoid entering into argument about the justification for opening fire. 6. HQ Northern Ireland have been asked to consider whether any further guidance is necessary to cover situations in which people attempt to evade arrest or escape from detention.

NORTHERN IRELAND The Defence Secretary held a meeting yesterday afternoon 
with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Chief of the General Staff and the GOC Northern Ireland were also 
present. Security Situation 2. 
Mr. Whitelaw said that the security authorities in 
Northern Ireland, and in particular the Special Branch, were concerned about the effects of the new low profile security posture, and about the diminution of intelligence which was resulting from the reduction in the number of arrests. There were fears that the morale of the Special Branch might suffer, which would have serious consequences since their continued cooperation was essential. On the other hand, he felt that the continued arrest of relatively unimportant people was of limited value and was likely to have adverse political effects. It was necessary to walk a tight rope between getting the necessary intelligence and not alienating moderate Catholic opinion. He added that he believed it was important to keep up a steady release of internees: from the cases he had examined he was not convinced that there had in many instances been strong grounds for internment. 
3. In discussion the point was made that the arrest of even 
minor IRA members helped to build up the intelligence picture and to contribute to the attrition of the IRA; it could also lead to more important arrests. On the other hand, the collection of intelligence must not be allowed to become an end in itself. It was now important to try to separate the moderate Catholics from the IRA and the arrest by night of minor suspects by the Army could frustrate this objective. The aim should be to try to arrest those extremists whom moderate opinion would like to see removed because they stood in the way of conciliation. It might be necessary in future to play down the arrests, to adopt softer methods and to make more use of the police. General Tuzo undertook to brief General Ford on this aspect

troops were fired on three times, returned fire once and opened fire on a gunman once. In one of the incidents, a soldier was slightly injured. In Londonderry there were six shooting incidents at the security forces. Fire was returned twice and it is believed that one gunman was hit. There were four shooting incidents in the rural areas. Troops were fired on three times, once from across the border near Garrison, Co. Fermanagh. In the fourth incident an ex-B Special was fired on near Newtownhamilton but was not injured. 6. 
Other incidents in the Province included a peaceful demonstra- 
tion in Belfast by 500 Protestant women outside Crumlin Gaol against the release of internees. Two wanted arrests were made in Belfast. There was the usual hooligan activity in both Belfast and Londonderry. There were three armed robberies in the rural areas. 7. 
Journalists at the Europa Hotel, Belfast have been told that 
Frank McManus and Bernadette Devlin are to hold a press conference at twelve o’clock today at which an important announcement is to be made.

7 June 1972 
You wrote to me on 30 May about two Northern Ireland points which the Prime Minister has raised. 
As to a Bill of Rights, we are looking carefully at possible arrangements under which minority and other rights are guaranteed by the United Kingdom Parliament or by the constitution itself. Whether a Bill of Rights, as it is generally thought of, is the most effective guarantee is one of the questions we will have to consider. We are, in fact, at present faced with a Bill of Rights for which Lord Brockway has obtained the first reading in the House of Lords and which is likely to receive a second reading in the second half of June. This Bill is little more than a rather clumsily revised version of a Bill which Lord Brockway presented in 1971 and it will have to be opposed on the main ground that it is not helpful at this juncture to consider such matters piecemeal. This does not mean to say that someformal statutory guarantee, possibly analagous to a Bill of Rights, may not form a helpful part of the framework of a final settlement. 
As to the second point, the Prime Minister probably has in mind the McGilligan camp on the extreme North West point of Northern Ireland which was temporarily used to house internees when Long Kesh could hold no more. (It is a good many miles away from Londonderry - in one of the most remote spots in Northern Ireland.) But now that over one-third of the present internees have been released, it has been possible to bring to an end the use of McGilligan for this purpose. Instead, it is now being temporarily used as an overflow prison for short-term prisoners from Belfast because the prisons in Northern Ireland are over-crowded, a state of affairs which is under review. The Secretary of State was satisfied that there was no alternative course at present.

Note of a meeting held on 6 June 
INTELLIGENCE The overall level of Republican terrorist activity is much the same. 
There have been reports that the Provisionals are considering some form of temporary cease-fire which they will almost certainly attempt to link with their projected election in the Bogside and Creggan. The Ulster Defence Association appears not to have any great stock of arms, but members have mentioned the possibility of obtaining rifles held by members of the Ulster Defence Regiment. OPERATIONS 2. 
The parades at the week-end were handled satisfactorily. It is possible 
that Protestants will attempt to set up permanent barricades this week-end. The spread of this activity in towns outside Belfast and Londonderry creates difficulties for the security forces. ARREST POLICY 3. 
The arrest of eight men last night, four of whom were on a ’wanted’ list, 
raises the question in what circumstances such arrests should be made. Three of the men are thought to be senior officers of the Belfast Provisionals. The question is which people should be arrested and for what purposes; criminal charges, questioning under the Special Powers Act, or in rare cases detention or internment. The Northern Ireland Office will arrange for the subject to be considered by the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland. 4. 
The policy regarding leading notables in the IRA such as John Stephenson 
is that they should be arrested if that is possible without causing disproportionate disorder, even if no evidence of a criminal offence is available. The Northern Ireland ffice is considering further guidance on this problem, in particular dealing with the possibilities of extradition or transfer of persons arrested to the Republic and the attitude to be adopted

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 020700 TO 050700 JUN 72 GENERAL 1. 
The most significant events of another busy but mostly peaceful weekend were the two marches and rallies, one Protestant (6000) in 
Londonderry on Saturday coordinated by the UDA and addressed by CRAIG, the other Catholic (350) in Armagh on Sunday organised by Republican Clubs affiliated to the Official IRA and’addressod by McGOILLA. Both events were marred by minor hooliganism, but there were no serious casualties. Further Portestant temporary ’No Go’ areas wore established on Saturday/ Sunday in Portadown Ballymena, Londonderry and Coagh, Co Tyrone but not in Belfast. Security Forces traffic was not impeded. On Friday two soldiers of 4 Fd Regt were killed near Rossela in a border mine incident. On Saturday night a car bomb exploded without warning outside a Catholic owned pub on the fringes of Ballymacarrett, causing 49 minor casualties only 4 of whom are still in hospital. In the Republic the Provisionals have announced the temporary appointment of David O’CONNEL as President on place of Rory O’BRADY pending the latter’s release. There was a demonstration at the Curragh by 200 people (mostly from NI) against the detention of Republicans. In London there was reportedly a Provisional march to Whitehall by several hundred supporters and Mrs DRUMM spoke outside the MOD. The GB weekend press was mostly devoted to the prospects for peace. 
2. During FRI/SAT 2/3 JUN. There were 32 shooting incidents and six 
explosions. 29 of the shooting incidents were in Belfast but the only casualty was a RC youth who was injured in an incident which did not involve the Security Forces . 
Two of the explosions were on the borders in one 
near Rosslea two soldiers wore killed and two wounded. Two ether bombs exploded in the rural areas (near Bessbrook and Dungiven) and the other two in Londonderry. 
3. During SAT/SUN 3/4 JUN. There were 19 shooting incidents and 2 explosions all of which took place in Belfast. In one of these explosions in the Catholic area of Est Belfast 49 people received minor injuries. One Catholic man was found shot dead in the New Lodge area and a gunman is thought to have been hit in the Ardoyne. The UDA march and rally in the Waterside area of Londonderry passed off with only minr hooliganism. 
4. During SUN/MON 4/5 JUN. There were 18 shooting incidents in which the Security Forces wore involved in 12. There were two explosions. There was one minor UDR casualty, one hit was claimed on a gunman in Belfast, and five civilians were wounded.

BELFAST PEACE PETITION 7. 
The Catholic peace movement announced on Thursday that it had collected 
40,000 signatures to a petition condemning the use of violence. The names have been collected outside churches in West Belfast in the past two weeks. 12 more churches in Belfast are hoping to start similar petitions. 
SDLP 8. 
In a major policy statement on 26 May the SDLP urged support for the 
Whitelaw administration and called on Catholics to return to their positions in public life. They repeated their call for an end to violence and announced that they would be seeking meetings with leaders of the Protestant community, in an effort to break down sectarianism. The Party asked Mr Whitelaw to make clear his intention with regard to the ending of internment, and said that every major step forward would be matched by a positive response from them. 
9. All the available members of the group of 32 leading Londonderry 
Catholics who withdrew from public office following internment have offered to return to public service and stated their support for Mr. Whitelaw’s policies. 
ADVISORY COMMISSION 
10. Mr. Whitelaw announced the names of the 11 members of the Advisory Commission on Northern Ireland in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 26 May. Mr. Faulkner restated his view that the Commission was undemocratic while almost all other political organisations expressed some reservations. 
SECURITY SITUATION 
11. The number of shooting incidents fell during the earlier part of the period, but now appears to have returned to the level of recent weeks. The bombing campaign continues and appears at present to be directed particularly towards commercial targets. A Loyalist march in the centre of Belfast on Saturday caused little disturbance, though conducted in a para-military fashion. Protestant barricading was not as widespread as had been feared. 
12. A shooting incident in the Ardoyne on Sunday evening caused 5 casualties, one of whom, a 12 year old girl, has since died. A civilian shot and wounded two men who approached his house between Banbridge and Rathfriland early on Tuesday morning. The men were arrested by the RUC and one died later of his wounds. An RUC inspector was wounded in Londonderry after an explosion in Waterloo Place. On Wednesday afternoon one soldier was fatally wounded on the same day when a mobile patrol was ambushed in Andersonstown Road, Belfast. 
13. Explosions during this period have caused numerous casualties and extensive damage to property. An Army medical officer was shot shilst examining a soldier who was injured when a 50-100 lb.bomb exploded in the Ardoyne. There were 4 other civilian casualties. 
One woman died, 42 civilians were injured 
and extensive damage to surrounding property was caused when a 100-150 lb.bomb exploded in a car in a Protestant-owned garage in the Falls. A 20-40 lb.bomb exploded outside a house in Ballymacarrett early on Sunday morning. Six civilians of whom two were known IRA members were kiLed and at least 17 others were injured. The Provisional IRA claimed that the bomb had been planted by

25 May, 1972. 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMARY FOR THE PERIOD 19 MAY - 24 MAY, 1972 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL The period has again seen attempts to set up Protestant "no-go" areas 
in Belfast, but these were contained by the security forces with the assistance of the local inhabitants. Explosions remain low in number if not in intensity though shooting incidents continue with both military and civilian casualties. There have been demonstrations by Catholics in Londonderry against IRA violence. 
2. Mr Faulkner has invited Mr Craig to join a Unionist committee on a new constitution for Northern Ireland, while in the Republic, Mr Lynch has announced his intention of strengthening the laws against illegal organisations. 
THE REPUBLIC 3. 
4. There have been several instances of incendiary devices being found in 
Dublin stores, though so far no serious injury has been caused, although there was some damage to property. 
The fact that some of the prisoners involved in the Mountjoy Prison 
riot have been removed to the Curragh has led to charges that internment is being introduced by the back door, but this was denied by the Minister for Justice, Mr O’Malley. 
MR LYNCH 5. 
In Dublin on Monday, Mr Lynch said that he intended to ask the 
Government to consider how the laws against illegal organisations could be strengthened. The Government was determined to ensure that private armies would not use the Republic as a base. The Irish Government had welcomed the British initiative in the North and Mr Whitelaw’s efforts to bring peace, but extremists of both communities tried to frustrate Mr Whitelaw’s efforts. Current IRA activities were postponing community reconciliation in the North and ultimate Irish unity. 
THE UNIONIST PARTY 
6. At a meeting of the Unionist Party’s Standing Committee in Belfast, Mr Brian Faulkner announced that he was setting up a committee which would try to draw up a constitution for a new Northern Ireland, acceptable to all

GEN 79 - Northern Ireland You will no doubt wish to organise the meeting’s discussion under the 
usual headings of the Security Situation; the Current Political and Economic Situation; and Long Term Policy Planning. A. The Security Situation 1. 
The Chief of the General Staff might be asked to give his usual 
report on the operational situation, with particular reference to:(a) 
(b) 
The attempts to establish "no-go areas" in Protestant areas of Belfast. 
The apparent hostility between the "Provisional" and "Official" wings ofthe IRA in Londonderry; and the reported revulsion against the "Official" wing among Roman Catholic women in Londonderry following the murder of Ranger Best. 
(c) (d) 2. 
The effectiveness of the reorganisation of the intelligence arrangements in Northern Ireland in terms of both political intelligence and information about the IRA. The possible need for reinforcement of the garrison. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might be asked to 
report to the Meeting on progress with:(a) 
The release ofinternees. (b) (c) 3. 
The investigation of allegations of brutality by the Security Forces. 
The drafting of a directive for the RUC on the conduct of interrogation. 
further rulings in the Courts bearing upon:(a) 
(This is becoming increasingly urgent.) The Attorney General might be asked whether there have been any 
The admissibility in evidence of "confessions" obtained by the RUC Special Branch. 
(b) The applicability to the "Provisional" IRA of Regulation 24(a) made under the Special Powers Acts. 
B. The Current Political and Economic Situation 4. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has circulated a 
memorandum (GEN 79(72) 7) inviting Ministers to confirm the provisional conclusion of their last meeting that the local government elections and the reorganisation of local government should proceed on the planned dates and

GEN 79: Northern Ireland The following are points which might be pursued under the customary 
headings of the security situation; the current political and economic situation; and long-term policy planning. A. 
The Security Situation (1) The Chief of the General Staff might be asked to give his usual report 
on the security situation, with particular reference to the weekend incidents of the explosion in Kelly’s Bar and the shooting on the "frontier" between the Ballymurphy and Springmartin districts of Belfast. (2) The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might report on progress 
with the release of internees, with particular reference to the possibility (which he is considering) of a measure of accelerated release. There will still, however, remain the problem of the "hard core". (3) 
Following the renewed allegations of brutality by the security forces 
and the doubt surrounding the validity of a number of confessions, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was asked to put forward proposals (with a view to a decision at this meeting) about the desirability of allowing the forms of interrogation employed hitherto by the RUC Special Branch to continue. He might be invited to report on this. (4) At the meeting on 2nd May the Secretary of State was asked to put in 
hand a study of the legal sanctions which might be invoked against prominent members of the IRA from the Republic who might be arrested by the security forces. He might be invited to report on this also. B. 
The Current Political and Economic Situation 
(1) and (2) The Secretary of State is circulating a memorandum on the application of Proportional Representation to local government elections; and he intends to raise orally the question of the Border plebiscite. 
It 
might be convenient to deal with these subjects at this point in the agenda. Separate briefs will be coming forward. (3) The Lord President might be asked to report on the discussions 
which he is conducting, in consultation with the Chief Whip and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in order to create satisfactory machinery at Westminster for dealing with legislation about Northern Ireland. (4) 
If the Secretary of State has not, by Thursday afternoon, been able to 
announce the setting up of the Advisory Commission, he might be asked how this stands.

Northern Ireland: Contingency Planning A short time ago Ministers commissioned a contingency study of the 
"worst case". This is attached; and I am sending copies of it, together with copies of this covering minute, to those Ministers whose Departments have been involved - the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Defence and the Home Secretary. 
I am also sending a copy to the Attorney General. The essential features of this report are as follows:(a) 
Legislation would be required (on the lines indicated in Appendix C) in order both to confer on the Government the necessary additional powers and, subsequently, to indemnify all concerned. 
(b) In order to be fully effective the policy would require an additional 27 major units plus supporting elements. 
(c) The reinstatement of internment and interrogation would be inevitable (on the basis of a potential "bag" of about 1600 additional internees in the first two weeks); and it would also be necessary to arrest on suspicion alone. 
(d) A great deal would depend on the extent to which we could continue to count on local co-operation as regards the maintenance of essential services and on the loyalty of the RUC. Otherwise, the result might be complete anarchy. 
(e) The impact on the Republic and on international opinion generally is unpredictable but would be bound to be adverse; and, in certain circumstances, a renewed threat to sterling might emerge. 
(f) For all these reasons we could not sustain this policy indefinitely or, perhaps, for very long. 
we should launch some new political initiative - possibly on an all-Ireland basis 
It would therefore be essential that - very soon after we had taken the drastic measures 
envisaged. Otherwise, or if the political initiative failed, the last state might be worse than the first. 
I have discussed the report with the Permanent Secretaries concerned 
and the CGS. It is explicitly addressed to a situation in which we are on the point of losing control of events unless we take very severe action indeed. Such a situation means that the IRA have intensified their campaign still

1. We were directed to examine a specific course of action that 
Ministers might wish to consider if the security situation in Northern Ireland had deteriorated so far that the Government were on the point of losing control of events. 
2. We have taken as a basic assumption that the Government’s aim remains 
the restoration of a stable society in Northern Ireland, which will remain part of the United Kingdom unless and until the majority of its inhabitants wish otherwise. 
We have not examined the option of a direct 
military assault upon the extremist-dominated Roman Catholic areas of the Province with the aim of securing a total military victory over the Irish Republican Army (IRA), on the ground that it would so completely alienate the.Roman Catholic community from the British Government as to destroy for many years any remaining prospect of re-establishing a stable society within the United Kingdom. 
Nor do we believe that Ministers 
would be willing to consider a complete withdrawal of military forces. 3. 
The course we have been asked to consider is one of strong but 
impartial action, aimed at the removal of arms and explosives by means of a massive reinforcement of troops, and accompanied by searches, interrogation, and probably internment. 
against extremists of both communities to restore law and order, to put an end to intersectarian violence, and to administer a shock in the hope of forcing both factions to realise the necessity of an agreed political solution. We have borne in mind the need to define a clear political objective, and to link military operations with a political initiative directed towards that objective. 
If the course of action contemplated did not achieve this result, the imposition of a political settlement It would be directed as necessary

of some of whose members would be subject to similar strain, could be reinforced by police from Great Britain is subject to limitations mentioned in Anne B. 
9. As to the conduct of the operation itself, Annex A describes a plan 
for an initial saturation of critical urban areas providing strongholds for extremists or offering particular scope for intersectarian violence; followed by the provision of coverage for other areas. 
An important 
question is whether this should be accompanied by a general search of all premises for arms and explosives, and a ban on movement enforced by the most rigorous means. 
Experience shows, however, that an indiscriminate 
search of premises for arms is hardly ever productive; and that a more effective method of obtaining information about arms would be to arrest and interrogate persons believed to have knowledge of their whereabouts, along with a more selective policy of searching premises for wanted individuals and arms. 
It is hoped that the selection of individuals for 
questioning would now be considerably more accurate than in the internment operation of 9 August 1971; but it must be recognised that only a limited proportion of unlicensed arms (most of which are held by Roman Catholics) would be recovered. 
We have assumed that in general arrests will fall 
into three categories:(a) Persons whom it is intended to detain for up to 5 days for questioning. 
(b) Persons against whom it is intended to prefer criminal charges, including the unauthorised holding of firearms. 
(c) Persons whom it is desired to intern (or detain for more than 5 days for purposes other than interrogation), if it is decided that a policy of internment will not jeopardise the political objectives of the operation. 
10. We are advised that an operation of this character could not be completed within less than one month and could not be sustained for more than three without the greatest difficulty. 
We have considered the practicability of imposing widespread restrictions on movement, wheeled

or on foot, throughout this period. If the warning announcement were 
made as in paragraph 7 above, the population might not have time to prepare for such restrictions by storing foodstuffs and other essential supplies. 
Even if they did have time, however, we believe that the 
imposition of total restriction on movement for a lengthy period would be met with civil disobedience comparable in kind, but greatly superior in scale, to that which followed the imposition of a "curfew" upon the Falls Road area in early July 1970. We do not believe that Ministers could expect officers to order soldiers to fire upon, or use other extreme measures against, unarmed and peaceful civilians, many of whom would no doubt be women and children, or soldiers to obey such orders. We have therefore assumed that comprehensive restrictions on movement will be applied only within limited areas for limited periods of time; and that the only sanction for their enforcement will be arrest under the Special Powers Acts. At the same time, however, we have assumed that there will be a widespread and strict control of the movement of vehicles throughout the Province; and, in the second phase of the operation, a tighter control of movement across the border (though this could never have more than limited effect). 
11. We have considered whether the overall control of the implementation of this policy should remain with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who would be responsible to Parliament for its general execution, subject to the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence for the specific actions of military personnel deployed in aid of the civil power; or whether alternatively Ministers would wish to vest emergency powers in the Governor of Northern Ireland, under whom a political figure (conceivably one of the Ministers of State in the Northern Ireland Department) would discharge the functions of the civil authority, while the General Officer Commanding (GOC), as Military Commander, would be vested with all powers necessary for the effective military conduct of the operation, but would not assume functions belonging to the civil power. The vesting of such powers in the Governor would involve a modification of part of the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, which could be secured only through a Bill at Westminster.

15. We conclude that an operation on the lines discussed is militarily feasible provided that Ministers accept the implications described below; and that it could be mounted within ten days of a Ministerial decision to launch it, provided that the necessary legislative measures could be introduced in advance of the completion of the build-up and passed through Parliament without delay. 
Implications 
16. We believe that, before adopting this completely new approach, Ministers should be aware of the following implications, all of which are likely to arise to a greater or lesser extent as indicated in the following paragraphs or in the Annexes:(a) the disruption of the life of Northern Ireland for which the security forces will be held responsible; 
(b) the loss of life and damage to property virtually certain to be inflicted by the security forces upon persons not themselves guilty of violence or terrorism; 
(c) the operation will in our opinion harden the polarisation of the two main factions and the alienation, certainly of the Roman Catholic community and probably of the Protestants as well, from the British connexion; 
(d) a need to resort again to internment, possibly on a large scale and certainly with a sectarian imbalance that would be represented as evidence of anti-Catholic bias; 
(e) 
a substantial requirement for legislation, which would need to be passed rapidly but which would contain elements unlikely to command bi-partisan support or to be accepted by Parliament without extensive discussion; 
(f) a need to seek legislation to indemnify Crown servants in respect of actions whose scope it will be impossible to define;

an end to intersectarian violence, and the administering of a shock to both factions) and in bringing nearer the Government’s ultimate objective (namely the restoration of a stable society in Northern Ireland). 
Assessment The Security Situation 
18. The IRA would use such warning time as was available to them to hide as many weapons as possible and to take men and material into the Republic. 
Secret sources have shown that their intention in the past 
if faced with such operations would have been to hide or abandon their weapons and to merge with the local population as their areas were occupied, retaining the ability to resume violence under more favourable conditions. They need relatively small quantities of arms and men to maintain an embarrassing level of violence; and, although internment on a large scale could be expected to have a significant long term effect, they would be capable of provoking serious incidents in the short term even if we managed to find most of the weapons they now have available in the North. 
When they found it safe to do so, the IRA could infiltrate 
men and bring in quantities of arms and explosives from the South. There is no reason to believe that even a major operation using 47 major units could stop them doing this altogether. 
19. The UDA are more vulnerable than the IRA insofar as a large number of the weapons available to them are registered. 
They have so far, 
however, not depended a great deal on firearms for their political effectiveness. 
weapons in the event of a search. 
They would probably succeed in concealing at least some In an emergency they might also 
expect to get weapons from elements of the UDR or help in hiding those already available to them. 
Their military effectiveness would be 
harder hit than that of the IRA by a major search operation; and they would find it more difficult than the IRA to restore it.

most unlikely that their capacity for violence could be eliminated altogether.

Protestant feelings would be a mirror-image of

however wild - While, therefore, the Government might gain some It is inevitable that the entrance

during the course of such searches. 
of atrocities or damage suffered by their neighbours The short-lived "curfew" imposed by 
the Army in the Falls Road in 1970 in order to carry out an arms search (which was not selective) remains a bitter memory among Catholics to this day. Catholic feeling would no doubt be inflamed by the usual IRA misrepresentations that the Army had negotiated or compromised with Protestants in a way in which they would not have dealt with Catholics. 
22. Protestants would be similarly outraged by searches. Their feelings 
would be compounded by the desperate fear that, by removing their arms, the Army was taking away from them their only means of preventing others from deciding their fate for them. 
They would believe that Catholics 
could easily be reinforced from the South and that, whether or not the Government so intended, the end result of the operation would be their forcible incorporation into the Republic. 
23. The effect of these reactions upon the immediate security situation is not easy to assess. During searches it is possible that demonstrations would build up in other areas and become increasingly large as time went on. Even if the areas under search, people might well take to the streets in the belief that when it came to the point the Army would neither be ordered nor prepared to fire or use extreme methods of crowd control against unarmed civilians. 
There would be a major risk of a renewal of

the terrorists would be rendered ineffective despite continuing access to arms. 
What has to be decided 
is whether to rely entirely on this indirect means of neutralising them or whether to rely on more direct means. 
those who are taken in for interrogation, or some of them at any rate, are kept in custody 
internment. Without the prospect that at least some 
of those interrogated would be interned, the process of interrogation would be unlikely to succeed. 
14. If it were agreed that the need to keep potential terrorists out of circulation outweighed the political penalties of doing so, the security forces could attempt in the course of the operation to arrest all those reliably believed to be members of the Provisional 
- and 
possibly the Official IRA, depending on their reactions as well as those reliably believed to be organisers of Protestant para-military activity. 
roughly estimated that up to 400 extremists would be arrested on the first day of the operation and some 50 a day during the ensuing two weeks - 
by the end of 
which it is expected that there would be roughly up to 1500 IRA members in custody (ie the 2000 known activists less those who had escaped or had been killed while offering resistance in the early stages) and perhaps 100 Protestants. 
This estimate of up to 1600 does not include the 300-odd at present interned. Special steps 
would obviously have to be taken, in that case, to provide adequate accommodation and staffing for their continuing custody and also the custody of those to be charged with offences. 
It is difficult to see how this could be done 
without removing a large number of convicted prisoners upwards of 1000 - from the prisons and camps in Northern Ireland to prisons in Britain. 
15. A compromise (which would rovide the sanction needed to support interrogation but would have much less effect in keeping terrorists out of circulation) would be to keep in custody a much smaller number (say 300) comprising the most important organisers of subversion and the most dangerous gunmen and bombers. 
Legal Powers for the Security Forces 
16. Most of the powers which the security forces are expected to recuire for the implementation of this plan are already available under the Special Powers Regulations. The additional powers which the Army itself would wish to have are considered in Annex C. 
17. But, however comprehensive the specific powers that 
are available, it will be inherent in the nature of the operation that individual members of the security forces will be faced even more than usual with taking instant decisions on whether and how to act (eg whether to open fire) and it is thought essential, if the security forces are not to be seriously inhibited, that such decisions should be taken without the fear of their legality 
In that case, it is 
On the answer to this question depends whether - detention and

This in Some additional space 
could be quickly found at Long Kesh (where there might be problems of segregation); how quickly that would be filled would depend on the rate of arrest. 
however, the space would be inadequate. 
For any serious attempt to lock up the men of violence, Any search for additional 
premises might conflict with the Services’ need for extra accommodation. Extra personnel could, within limits, be found from the English and Scottish prison services, but the demand would outstrip supply if, as they well might, members of the Northern Ireland prison service refused to take part in the "interning" (as it would be seen) of Protestants. It would be possible to fall back on the Armed Forces; but this would presumably be at the expense of their strength in the operational role. 
Effect on the public of restriction of movement 7. 
The physical effects on the public of any "curfew" or restriction 
of movement would depend on the comprehensiveness and duration of the restrictions and the searches. (a) From the start of the operation, the emergency services (fire, 
ambulance and hospital) would still have to be staffed, as would prisons, telephone exchanges, power stations, and waterworks. Without these, the efficiency of the operation would be reduced. The civilian population would derive some benefit from the manning of these services; and there would have to be certain other exemptions from the restrictions (e.g. for doctors and midwives). (b) After 24 hours provision would have to be made for people to The Falls "curfew" in July 1970 showed that many

surprise. The public authorities involved would be able to function more 
efficiently if notice were given. 9. 
However, in the context of an operation designed to startle people 
into their senses, the reactions of the public would be likely to be more important than their afflictions. 
The reaction would be hostile and 
indignant: the curfew and the searching of homes would breed discontent; any damage during the searches would fan the flames. 
movement might be swept away by this reaction; Catholics might see the curfew, searches, and shooting as a repetition of pst misdeeds with Westminster, like Stormont, basically against them. 
against Protestant extremists, Protestant moderates would probably be swamped in the general reaction to another "betrayal". 
Physical opposition to the security forces Both attitudes 
would be righteously adhered to no matter how hard the security forces strove to be impartial.

it in their power to cut off electricity and interfere with other essential services, but would be inflicting hardship on their own community and are perhaps more likely to initiate a civil disobedience campaign just as the Catholics are likely to intensify theirs. 
11. Any feeling that the arrest policy of the security forces was equivalent to internment would greatly intensify the hostility of the reaction on all sides, including probably that of many moderates. Massive civil disobedience must then be considered likely; and there would be ready support for armed opposition to the security forces.

2. The following additional powers would on any view require legislation:- 
(i) It would be essential to make provision for the transfer of convicted prisoners (though not internees) from custody in Northern Ireland to custody anywhere in Great Britain without the necessity for their consent. 
(ii) A provision (not yet fully worked out) would be desirable to authorise the setting up of special or additional civilian criminal courts or to modify the procedure for the trial of offences in order to prevent undue delay in the administration of justice during the emergency period.

(ii) Because the Security Forces could no longer 
arrest men on suspicion, but only those who could at once be charged with offences, the supply of tactical intelligence had greatly declined. 
Good tactical 
intelligence would not however be forthcoming unless the Security Forces were able to back their interrogation with the threat of some form of detention or internment. But a return to a policy of raids, followed by interrogation and internment, would alienate Catholic opinion and we had for the present to accept a fall in the quality of tactical intelligence. (iii) Different views were held on whether the Provisionals were likely to step up their campaign of violence or not. 
The GOC thought that after the 
Provisionals had had the opportunity to regroup and renew their supplies ofammunition, violence would increase: but the intelligen 
view was that those Provisional 
leaders who operated out of Dublin thought that they were unlikely to achieve their aims by continuing violence, and that their view might well prevail. (iv) It was agreed that the Security Forces should 
not mount any substantial operation in border areas (e.g. at Strabane) because of the risk of cross-border incidents.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 140700 TO 170700 HRS JULY GENERAL 1. 
The pattern of violence continued at a high level, but shooting incidents/bombings decreased in number from 245/11 on Fri/Sat, through 114/7 on Sat/Sun to 61/3 on Sun/Mon. 
nevertheless casualties were 
heavy and included five soldiers (making 13 in all in the 7 days since the ceasefire ended, the worst week yet), one RUC and one civilian killed. Terrorist casualties included one definately killed and 54 hits claimed by Security Forces. In Belfast, the main areas- of activity were in Ballymurphy and the Ardoyne where shooting was frequent; and in Lenadoon, where the evacuation of some 2000 (NOT 3000) people, if not a propaganda exercise, makes one wonder what measure of moderate opinion still remains in such areas. In Londonderry, a confused situation about barrier building put the Army in a poor light through no apparent fault of its own; and the Provisional leader there has been reported as saying that the bombing programme for the city centre was practically complete but would be continued in other ways, mainly against Army targets. In the Rural Are s, a youth of 18 died on Saturday in Strabane after incidents during which soldiers being stoned replied by firing rubber bullets. But the worst incidents were those at Crossmaglen involving the death of an ATO on Saturday and the mining of a 1DWR pig on Sunday when two soldiers were killed. In the Republic, Mr Lynch’s government had a majority of 4 in the 2 days debate 
on Ulster but faces a critical bye 
election in mid Cork in early August. In Great Britain, weekend press headlines were all dominated by Ulster and concentrated variously on the end of the ceasefire; the refugees; the abandonment of the plans to protect the Londonderry City centre; Lenadoon; and the possible involvement of freed internees in the renewed campaign of violence. Few if any of the papers linked the refugee problem with the annual holidays. The leader writers recognised the gravity of the situation but while acknowledging the dangers of any alteration of the current policy of conciliation in the long term, accepted for the most part that force must be met with equal force and that in the short term the power of the terrorists must be reduced by positive action. 
2. During FRI/SAT 14/15 JUL 72. There were 245 shooting incidents with 
the Security Forces involved in 194. Two soldiers were killed in Belfast, one of them when a pig was pierced. Nine other soldiers were wounded two of them are VSI. 39 hits were claimed and one body of a terrorist was recovered. There were two major explosions in Belfast and three in Londonderry. In the Border/Rural areas there were six explosions and five devices were neutralized. 
3. During SAT/SUN 15/16 JUL 72. There were 114 shooting incidents with 
the Security Forcem involved in 76. Capt YOUNG RAOC, ATO, was killed whilst attempting to dismantle a bomb near Forkill in Co Armagh. One RUC constable was killed and two others were wounded in Belfast. There were no other Security Force casualties and nine hits were claimed. There were no explosions in Belfast,one in Londonderry and six in border/rural areas. In Londonderry a plan to build a road block in William S. and one in Waterloo Place to make it more difficult for bombs to be brought from the Bogside/Cregan was abandoned as a result of a political decision. In Belfast a number of women and children left for the Republic but it is expected that most will return after the holidays. There were demonstrations

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and 
Mr. Woodfield reported this afternoon on their talk with the Provisional leaders this afternoon. The Provisionals were represented by: Mr. MacStiofain Mr. O’Connell Mr. MacGuinness Mr. Adams Mr. Tuomey Mr. Bell (or Barl) 
The six men were accompanied by a Dublin lawyer who was not the same lawyer as at the earlier meeting. Mr. MacStiofain was very much in charge. They started by reading out from a piece of paper 
a statement which said that the leadership of the IRA welcomed the discussions with the Secretary of State, which they hoped would lead to a settlement of the problems of Ireland. It was now necessary to devise machinery by which the will of the people of Ireland could be given effect. The IRA took the view that this could best be achieved by following their peace plan. The peace plan contains three main elements: (i) the British Government should recognise publicly that it is the right of the whole of the people of Ireland acting as a unit to decide the future of Ireland; 
(ii) the British Government should undertake to withdraw the British Army from Ireland by 1975;

One point outstanding from the Meeting’s previous discussion of 
the Attorney General’s memorandum GEN 79(72) 8 was his recommendation (paragraph 26) that for the present there should not be any statutory indemnity for members of the security forces in either civil or criminal matters. 2. 
presented for discussion. 
A similar view has been reached by officials in the report now Officials point out that the question of 
indemnity only arises when the wide powers conferred under the Special Powers Acts are exceeded; that there are obvious objections to the enactment of a general indemnity before order has been restored and all detainees released; and that any form of indemnity which appreciably abridges existing domestic remedies in respect of the breaches of the Human Rights Convention alleged by the Government of the Republic would undermine our case against the admissibility of the allegations before the Commission at Strasbourg. They consider that, if we find ourselves confronted with a spate of private prosecutions or civil actions giving rise to security problems or other major embarrassments, an Act which went no further than barring private prosecutions and transferring compensation jurisdiction from the courts to administrative tribunals would raise fewer problems in Parliament and at Strasbourg; but that, unless we are so confronted, it would be best to wait until order has been restored before considering whether an act of indemnity would be appropriate. 3. 
You lave yourself made the point that one of the reasons for the 
imposition of direct United Kingdom rule in Northern Ireland has been the need to ensure that the rule of law operates there as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The meeting may therefore be prepared to accept the advice of officials backed by the Attorney General; but Ministers will no doubt wish to ask the Attorney to keep under close review the number of private prosecutions and civil actions lest a situation should arise so exceptional as to call for special measures on the lines indicated by the report.

4. Separately from the memorandum under discussion you may wish 
to raise two other points connected with the administration of justice. (a) How do we stand as regards the investigation by the RUC into allegations of brutality? 
(At the time of writing an interim 
report, said to be rather inconclusive, has been received by the Director of Public Prosecutions in Belfast - the Attorney General may be able to say more tomorrow morning.) 
(b) How do we stand as regards the preparation of a case for Sir John Peck to put to Mr. Lynch by the middle of this month in the hope of securing a further postponement of the Strasbourg hearings? 
5. You will also wish to know that the individuals mentioned at the 
last Meeting, whose interrogation has been completed, have now been released from detention.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the purpose of the discussion should be to consider the forthcoming White Paper, particularly in relation to what it would say about the formation of an Executive within the Northern Ireland Assembly and about a Council of Ireland; and timing. The events of 7 February, when the Protestant extremists forced widespread strikes, particularly in Belfast which were accompanied by serious outbreaks of violence, had led to a reaction by the moderate Protestants. 
An important development had been the joint approach to 
the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 9 February by the leaders of the Unionist, Independent Unionist, Northern Ireland Labour and Alliance Parties (Mr Faulkner, Mr Paisley, Mr Simpson and Mr O’Neill) who had pledged their support for any measures he might take to suppress violence and maintain order. 
A contributing factor in the outburst of 
7 February had been the arrest of a small group of Protestant extremists. The arrest of a larger number after 7 February, some of whom had been subjected to detention orders and others charged, had not led to trouble. 
Action against extremists would continue. 
These developments had a bearing upon the timing and the content of the White Paper. 
Ireland, Mr Lynch, to hold a General Election on 28 February, which argued against publishing the White Paper before that date; and the importance of settling the constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland, if possible, well in advance of a General Election in the United Kingdom. 
Other factors were the decision of the Prime Minister of This last consideration might argue in favour of a 
clear definition of the constitution in the White Paper, rather than an evolutionary approach which would leave the details to be discussed with the Northern Ireland Assembly when it was created through elections towards the end of this year. 
Strong action against Protestant extremists must be accompanied by continuing action against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). If Mr Lynch were re-elected he might be prepared to do more against them in the South. 
We needed an assessment of how far and how quickly 
he might be willing to move against them and of how much, in practice, he would be able to do so.

4. Provisional IRA activity has been aimed both to exploit and to foster intercommunal tension. The level and variety of incidents has been consistent with TWOMEY’s intention not to tone down activity in any way. 
5. During the week a battalion adjutant, two company commanders, a company quartermaster, and two company explosives officers of the Provisional IRA were arrested. The Commissioners courts reviewed 18 cases and confirmed 16 for detention. 
REPUBLICANS 
6. It has been reliably reported that ADAMS (who has been the Provisionals’ Brigade Adjutant in BLFAST) is now in DUBLIN as assistant to the Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA, and that the Tatter is 
It is alleged that was 
given this appointment in order to provide representation from the North among Provisional leaders in the South and also to please the younger element of the Provisionals in BELFAST. 
7. A meeting of Provisional leaders was due to have been held on 3/4 February to discuss further their policy towards the publication of the White Paper. Provisional plans have been reported to include the strengthening of units in Catholic areas for ’protective’ duties, the augmentation of ASUs in border areas and an intensification of the campaign of violence throughout Northern Ireland. We have had no intelligence to confirm whether or not the meeting planned for 3/4 February was held. 
8. It is reliably reported that the Official IRA/Sinn Fein 
have produced a document entitled "Whitelaws White Paper: the IRAs Reply" and that this document is to be released to the press at the end of February. There is no evidence as yet that the Cfficials have decided to adopt a more militant policy. 
PROTESTANTS 
9. There is intelligence that, at the meeting of Protestant militant leaders on 6 February, chaired by 
, to discuss 
their response to the signing of Interim Custody Orders on two UDA/UVF men, it was agreed that serious confrontation between the Protestant para-military groups and the security forces should be avoided. 
and that the rioting had got out of control. 
10. Similarly, there has been evidence of some disenchantment among moderate protestants who had been in favour of peaceful industrial action and meetings and marches to petition the RUC. There are signs of a sharp reaction against the violence which took place and the position of CRAIG, who undoubtedly carries the ultimate responsibility, is believed to have been weakened. The appearances which he is due to make next week may give further indications of this. The public reaction, if any, to the arrests 
were recriminations among these leaders and some of this was aimed at

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 070700 TO 080700 HRS FEB 73 GENERAL 1. 
There were 110 shooting incidents 78 of which involved SF (Belfast 
99/75, Londonderry 2/1, Border 1/1, Rural 8/1). There were 2 rocket attacks (both ineffective) and 3 explosions (all rural areas). There were 2 SF casualties (one VSI), and 8 civilian casualties (5 dead). The 5 dead are made up of 3 gunmen hit by SF (bodies in hospital), a fireman killed in Sandy Row and a body thought to be that of the Protestant reported as missing (abducted) in yesterdays sitrep. 
2. In Belfast the call by leaders of loyalists for general civil unrest 
received widespread support. In Londonderry, as was anticipated, the strike produced noticeable closures in industry and commerce and in the country the atmosphere was tense particularly in urban areas. In areas outside Belfast the majority of industrial closures was due to power failure rather than to active support for the strike. 
3. Belfast was the scene of most of the days activity. There was 
picqueting of RUC stations by UDA/Tartans and some check points were erected but removed by SF. 
Shooting was widespread particularly in New Lodge 
(following rioting in the afternoon), Ardoyne (at the Louisa St OP), in Sandy Row (where a fireman was killed) and in East Belfast (where 2 
gunmen were hit). Shooting also occurred in the Falls (during the funeral of the IRA killed in New Lodge 3/4 Feb), in the Clonard (where SF claim 2 hits - one body in RVH) and across the interface in the Ardoyne. The major incident of the day was in the area of Willowfield RUC station where a UDA crowd, out of control, ransacked a RC church and the priest’s house. They were dispersed with the firing of 11 PVC rounds (used for the first time and found to be very effective). 
In a border incident at Clady 3 
hits were claimed by SF. BELFAST 4. 
SF were involved in 75 of the 99 shooting.incidents. It was a day of 
general civil unrest resulting from the call by loyalist leaders for reaction to the signing of the first two ICOs on Protestants. Intimidation took place to support this unrest. There were power cuts at various times and most schools, factories and shops were closed for the day. By 1500 hrs the main RUC stations were picqueted by UDA/Tartans. In the main they were peaceful but a group of 1200 outside Willowfield RUC station got out of control and attacked the RC church and the priest’s house next it. The crowd dispersed after 11 PVC baton rounds were fired at them. There was considerable Tartan and UDA activity throughout the day including the erection of check points on roads in Protestant areas throughout Belfast and the burning of shops and houses. A protracted exchange of fire took place between SF and gunmen during the afternoon in the Tmplemore Ave/Beechfield Street and the Ballymacarrett areas of East Belfast. Pte HALL of 1 GREEN HOWARDS received GSW to the back and is VSI.2 hitshare: claimed against gunmen in these incidental(2 bodies recovered). 2.

Appendix 1 to Annex B to A/BR/30/3/1/MO4 Dated 
January 1973 
SUMMARY OF SECURITY FORCES ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE OPERATION MOTORMAN 31 JULY - 31 DECEMBER 1972 
1. Despite the withdrawal of nine IS battalions since the implementation of 
Operation MOTORMAN, Phase 3 of the operation, the build up of intelligence and the removal of key terrorists, continues. Though neutralisation of the IRA has not been completely achieved, vigorous and successful actions by the Security Forces have seriously reduced the IRA’s morale and made the most encouraging inroads into their command structure. Simultaneously, with the development of Protestant militancy and a more general polarisation of the communities, SF have had to look to both directions and a good deal of military effort has been devoted to counteracting extreme Protestant groups. Some measure of the endeavour is reflected in the following statistics which cover the period since Operation MOTORMAN was launched (31 July) to the end of 1972:

The number of squadrons remains at 4. The number of squadrons is now 4. 
ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT 5. 
The strength of the UDR as at 31 December 1972 was 8,959. This represents 
a decrease of 197 on the previous month. This decrease is as a result of less applications( and the new policy to weed out those members who have a poor attendance record. 
DETENTION 6. 
a. By 29 December the Commissioners had reviewed the cases of 167 men who had 
been interned and ordered the release of 63. The following remain interned/ detained as at 31 December 1972: 
10 interned under the previous powers whose cases have not yet 
been reviewed by the Commissioners. b. 
teen reviewed by the Commissioners. c. 
d. 106 detained under the previous powers whose cases have not yet 104 who were previously interned and whose cases have been 
reviewed by the Commissioners who have ordered that they should be detained. 
72 detained since the introduction of the Commission and held under interim custody orders until their cases are heard by the Commissioners. 
It should be noted that since the introduction of the "Detention of Terrorists" (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 on 7 November 1972 there have been 265 arrests with a view to possible detention. Apart from the 72 who have had interim custody orders served on them, a further 17 have had criminal charges brought against them. 
CEASEFIRE POLICY 7. 
It is possible that the Provisional IRA, as part of their plan to gain 
political respectability, will try to reach a negotiated truce. Mr Whitelaw has said that he will not negotiate with the Provisionals again as their behaviour towards the ceasefire of June/July 1972 has-demonstrated that they are completely untrustworthy. Therefore the Secretaries of State for Defence and Northern Ireland have agreed that in future, should the Provisionals express a wish for a ceasefire, they should be advised to cease firing. The Security Forces would continue to take action against those who break the law or who engage in terrorist activities. In fact for the Army it would be "business as usual" at least until there were real signs of the intention of a ceasefire being translated into fact. Should this good faith be exhibited then clearly political and military activity would be reconsidered.

PROPAGANDA 8. 
With the continuing numbers of unexplained murders IRA propaganda and 
Catholics generally have been quick to refer to these as sectarian murders and attribute them to Protestant extremists and in some cases Army Assassination Squads. While it is true that about twice as many Catholics as Protestants have been murdered this year it is not true that all those are the work of the UVF/UDA, some are almost certainly IRA punishments and others straight criminal activity. We therefore do not favour the expression "sectarian" murders. Nor do we want to encourage the propaganda deduction that "the Security Forces do not protect you, the Catholics, from the murdering Protestants and therefore we, the IRA (Provisional or Official), will defend you and you must support us". Immediate steps have been taken operationally to counter this spate of murders the most notable of which was the formation of a joint RUC/RMP Task Force initially operating in East Belfast. 50 RMP with an equal number of RUC have been specially charged with investigating these murders and with preventing further cases. The force is assisted by an extension of the anonymous telephone-in facility (robotphone). 
9. From the Army’s point of view the most serious propaganda attacks have been 
charges that Army morale is sagging. The basis for this assessment is the publicity given to discharge by purchase rates in 2 PARA and the conviction by court martial of 4 soldiers of 3 RRF for drug offences. Guidance on these two subjects has been issued, but. briefly,the number of discharge by purchase applications in 2 PRA is not considered exceptional in view of the freeze during their tour in Northern Ireland; and a total of 90 convictions of soldiers by court martial and 16 in civil courts for drug offences in 1972 is not high considering the seriousness with which even minor infringements are viewed. The majority of cases involve cannabis. Of course frequent service in Northern Ireland has an effect on soldiers, but there is no evidence that this has resulted in a loss of morale nor that is has affected operational efficiency. 
LEGAL PROCEDURES 
10. Lord Diplock has presented the report of his Commission on legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities and the Government has announced its intention to implement his recommendations. Legislation is therefore being prepared and this may include those emergency powers which will still be required if the Government decides to repeal the Special Powers Act. The Commission recognised that there was a continuing need for detention by the executive, but they proposed, amongst other things, various changes in court procedures which will be of considerable assistance to the Security Forces. The most significant of these are the trial of terrorist offences by a judge sitting alone, restrictions on the granting of bail and the admissibility of confessions and certain written statements. 
DIRECTIVES 
11. CGS issued his Directive to the GOC in the form outlined in the Monthly Report for November. As a result CLF issued a revised Directive for future operations to cover the period until the publication of the White Paper. He gave as his mission: 
"In closest co-operation with the RUC, the Army in Northern Ireland is progressively to diminish the ability of extremist organisations and their followers to influence political events or to terrorise any section of the population." 
CLF gave the three brigades the following tasks in order of priority: a. 
their campaign. b. 
To continue the attrition of the IRA’s will and capacity to continue 
To protect and be seen to protect sections of the community who are, or who believe themselves to be, threatened.

good deal of disturbance in the area which involved most of the days shooting, during the disturbances 97 baton rounds were fired. At 2310 hrs SF broke a front door light which was illuminating a patrol at 93 Ladbrooke Drive. The owner, David Watts (32) (RC) then opened the door to show the hall lights. Shots were then fired at the patrol from the West end of Strathroy Park and Watts was hit in the foot and back. A soldier was grazed on the face by a round in an incident in Colligan St. LONDONDERRY

The Secretary of State said that although consultations over the political future were vital it was important to deal with the current security situation. He was gravely disturbed by a recent development which could inhibit successes against the Provisional IRA - successes which were now very considerable. The results of the recent spate of sectarian murders were that support for the IRA would be encouraged in some areas and there would be renewed demands for more troops to be diverted from hard Roman Catholic areas to other areas, with a consequent risk of a resurgence of IRA activities. It was wrongly alleged that all these murders were the work of Protestant extremists; but he believed that some of them were and it was his feeling that the attack the previous night at the Rolls Royce factory had been the work of Protestants. The security forces would do their best to track down the perpetrators of such crimes but they frequently encountered a wall of silence, although changes had been made in recent months in the arrangements in respect of intelligence and information. The Orange Lodge said that in the view of the majority of their members - and they believed in the view of the majority of the loyalist community 
- the White Paper would be irrelevant as long 
as the security situation stayed as it was. They accepted that a good deal of the recent murders were the work of Protestants. But this was not so in every case and furthermore they had warned three years previously that, if the security situation were to drift, murders on this scale would be a natural consequence. As far as the Rolls Royce attack was concerned, it should be realised that whereas the Communist cell in West Belfast was pro-Republican, the Communist cell in East Belfast was pro-Protestant. The Secretary of State said that he would take note of this point. He believed it was important to distinguish between those who organised and those who carried out acts of violence. Furthermore, he had never equated the UDA with the IRA in the level of viciousness of their activities. He believed that many members of the UDA would shrink from the kind of murders which were now being committed. The Oran Lodge believed that the security forces could not be impartial when confronted with nominal Roman Catholics who were members of the Official and Provisional IRA although there was a case fcr saying that Protestants should have been taken when internment was

To this objective, as an informed Christian, I am guided by the social teachings of my Church, rather than upon the arguments of political or social theorists, in my daily approach to relationships with my neighbour and community. 
The special task which the Prime Minister has asked me to undertake is to seek out the various elements of thought in the Catholic community in regard to the present crisis and, insofar as I can interpret them, to convey them to him and to the Cabinet as a whole. 
It goes without saying that this is a role which I cannot adequately discharge without substantial support and goodwill from the community, and particularly, a measurable degree of sympathy and understanding from my Catholic fellow citizens. I hope I will have that. 
Naturally enough, people will want to know where I stand in relation to issues about which there is considerable controversy. There are one or two such issues upon which I would like to make my position clear immediately. 
First of all, internment. If I had been a member of the Cabinet when this 
matter was under discussion, I would undoubtedly have been opposed to it. Now that it is an accomplished fact, I think the important thing is to create as soon as possible the circumstances in which it can rapidly be ended, and in the meantime to ensure that what is inevitably a distasteful business is conducted with fairness and humanity. The Prime Minister has emphasised to me that the Advisory Committee, on which an eminent English lawyer and a local businessman serve with Judge Brown, is able to review all cases, and that he has publicly stated that it would be quite extraordinary if he were not to accept this advice. He has, in fact, released every internee whose release the Committee has recommended. 
I now want to make clear my views on the constitutional issue. I accept without reservation the position as established by the Ireland Act of 1949 that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland can only be sustained or changed by democratic methods and with majority consent. 
This proposition 
seems to me to be based both on morality and on commonsense. It also seems to me indisputable that, at this point in time, a majority wish to retain the constitutional link with Great Britain, and this being so I do not believe that active discussion of imminent change is realistic or profitable. However, I believe strongly that citizens here have the right by all legitimate peaceful and democratic means to advocate and to work for the ultimate unification of Ireland, if that is their aspiration; and the Prime Minister has assured me that he also affirms that right.

10th November, 1971 In connection with a civil action which is being brought 
in the Northern Ireland courts against the RUC and the Ministry of Defence, as a result of the arrests made on 9th August, we consider it necessary to claim Crown Privilege for some of the documents which would otherwise have to be disclosed in the action. Since the claim would be made for reasons of security, it needs the approval not only of the Attorney General (which is being sought concurrently by the Treasury Solicitor) but also of the Prime Minister, before the Secretary of State can sign the necessary certificate. I am afraid there is some urgency about the matter since, as I explain below, it is necessary for the Chief of Staff at Headquarters Northern Ireland to be ready, by noon tomorrow, to swear an affidavit declaring that from his own knowledge Crown Privilege will be claimed at the preliminary hearing of the action which is due to take place on 17th November. If he cannot do so, and nevertheless refuses to disclose the documents, we are advised that we shall be in contempt of court. 
The background, putting it as briefly as possible, is 
that the Northern Ireland courts have already held that there was a technical defect in the arrest procedure which was followed by the RUC and the Army when making the initial arrests on 9th August. The immediate outcome of this decision was that two of the persons arrested 
- and 
subsequently interned - were granted writs of habeas corpus; though, as you will recall, they were then re-arrested in the correct manner - as they left the court, and have remained in internment. Since that decision, all the other original arrests have either (as has happened in most cases) been overtaken by internment orders, or 
the arrested 
persons have been released. And, of course, the more recent arrests made under the Special Powers Act have been carried out in what the courts held to be the correct manner.

b. 
Annex C. Some of the owners of the vehicles are still at large and these descriptions are a useful factor in effecting their arrest. Disclosure could lead to disposal of the vehicles and make the task of arresting the owners more difficult. 
c. Annex D. If the internal organisation of 
Ballykinler became generally known, the knowledge could be used to create further difficulties for the authorities in carrying out the internment policy and might be of assistance to attempts to rescue those arrested. 
HQ Northern Ireland consider, however, that no sensitivity can now be attached to the instructions for making arrests (Annex B). It is therefore proposed to make this Annex available, and the sheet of names of wanted persons containing Moore’s name, but nothing else. 
Under the relevant provisions of Northern Ireland law 
(which differ slightly from those elsewhere in the United Kingdom) it would be necessary for the Chief Constable and the Chief of Staff to swear affidavits before a Commissioner of Oaths, covering the documents relevant to the case in their possession. Given the proposed timing of the preliminary hearing on 17th November, the affidavits must be sworn on the afternoon of 11th November if the defendants are not to be in contempt of court. If it is agreed that Crown Privilege should be claimed for the documents listed above, the certificate making the claim need not be signed by the Secretary of State until shortly before the preliminary hearing 
- so long as the 
Chief of Staff can declare in his affidavit tomorrow that the claim will be made. The substantive decision whether to claim Crown Privilege for these documents has therefore to be taken before midday tomorrow. (Earlier advice from the Northern Ireland Government had suggested that the certificate claiming privilege for these documents, as well as for any which are in the possession of the RUC, should be signed by Mr. Faulkner, but this has proved incorrect: hence the regrettably short notice, for which I apologise.)

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 8 5 NOVEMBER 1971 
INCIDENTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS It was a relatively quiet period throughout the Province 
with one bomb explosion and seven shooting incidents. A bomb exploded in the Regency Hotel in Belfast and a second device in the York Hotel in Belfast took ten hours to be defused. 2. 
A search was carried out in the Andersonstown area of Belfast 
between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. As a result of this search 15 people were detained and a quantity of medical supplies, stick grenades and one shotgun were found. A statement will be issued as soon as possible about the incident in which a woman was hit in the face by 
a rubber bullet during the search. (Consideration is also being given to taking up with "The Times" their repetition in their report on the Andersonstown search of the IRA story of some weeks ago that 
a rubber bullet had been fired into a church while Mass was being said. The Army’s investigation of this incident had led to a statement being issued at the time which showed that the IRA version bore little relation to the facts.) 3. 
In the Ardoyne area of Belfast an IRA (PROVISIONAL) unit 
commander was arrested. 4. 
A military cratering party 325 metres within Northern Ireland 
in the Keady area in Co Armagh were fired on by gunmen. There were no casualties. 5. 
A Scots Guards soldier injured in Belfast on 14 September 
died in Glasgow of his injuries. He was the 34th regular soldier to be killed. Arrests 6. 
Since 9 August there have been 876 arrests under the Special

Powers Act. Of this number 460 have since been released. 402 of them did not reach the stage of having detention orders served on them; 50 received detention orders but did not reach the stage of internment; and 8 were released after internment. 7. 
The Home Office are making further enquiries to establish 
how many of those arrested have been charged with criminal offences and how many were immediately charged with offences committed at the time of their arrest; e.g. taking part in a riot. 8. 
Following consultation with Headquarters Northern Ireland 
it has been decided not to publish as a matter of course the numbers of those arrested who are on the wanted list. The main reason for this is that a fairly high proportion of them are subsequently released for a variety of reasons (in some cases we release them for our own purposes.) It has however been agreed that Headquarters Northern Ireland should continue their present practice of releasing the number of wanted arrests on a selective basis. This will enable them to use the figures as and when there is advantage in doing so: for example, it was revealed yesterday that many of the 52 people who were detained in Belfast and Londonderry for questioning were on the wanted list. Headquarters Northern Ireland will also continue to 
disclose, when there is advantage in 
doing so, when IRA officers have been arrested. Border Incursions 9. 
HM Ambassador in Dublin has been told to draw the attention 
of the Irish authorities to the recent incident in which a Gardai car drove some distance into Northern Ireland and to invite them to make such investigations as they think necessary. It has been decided not to make representations about the incident in which an Irish helicopter flew over Northern Ireland. It is now known that it was carrying medical supplies, and there is an unwritten

appointment will, under Proviso (b) of Section 8(4) of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, be limited to a period of 6 months "unless he is or becomes a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland". 
You may be interested to see the full text (enclosed) of a statement which the new Minister made on taking up office; the appointment has been well received by moderates in both the Protestant and Catholic communities though it has also, predictably, been criticised by the SDLP. 
It is my intention, as soon as Dr Newe has settled in to his new duties, to discuss with him the possibility of establishing a Minority Council and I will keep you informed of developments on this. 
To complete the picture of my recent changes in the Government I should perhaps mention the appointment of Commander Albert Anderson as a Senior Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs though such an appointment was no part of our earlier discussions. With so much happening on the security front and with John Taylor and myself tied up very much with Departmental and Parliamentary duties I have long felt the need for someone to take a more active interest in the work of the security forces on the ground. 
My letter of 14 October ended with a reference to the Advisory Committee on Internment. The Advisory Committee has been making good headway and to date has reviewed 99 cases; of these they have recommended release for 10 men and continued internment for 83 with consideration deferred for the remaining 6. Of the 10 cases recommended for release 7 men have actually been sent home and release has been directed in one other case; 2 cases are at present under my consideration.

To this objective, as an informed Christian, I am guided by the social teachings of my Church, rather than upon the arguments of political or social theorists, in my daily approach to relationships with my neighbour and community. 
The special task which the Prime Minister has asked me to undertake is to seek out the various elements of thought in the Catholic community in regard to the present crisis and, insofar as I can interpret them, to convey them to him and to the Cabinet as a whole. 
It goes without saying that this is a role which I cannot adequately discharge without substantial support and goodwill from the community, and particularly, a measurable degree of sympathy and understanding from my Catholic fellow citizens. I hope I will have that. 
Naturally enough, people will rant to know where I stand in relation to issues about which there is considerable controversy. There are one or two such issues upon which I would like to make my position clear immediately. 
First of all, internment. If I had been a member of the Cabinet when this 
matter was under discussion, I would undoubtedly have been opposed to it. Now that it is an accomplished fact, I think the important thing is to create as soon as possible the circumstances in which it can rapidly be ended, and in the meantime to ensure that what is inevitably a distasteful business is conducted with fairness and humanity. The Prime Minister has emphasised to me that the Advisory Committee, on which an eminent English lawyer and a local businessman serve with Judge Brown, is able to review all cases, and that he has publicly stated that it would be quite extraordinary if he were not to accept this advice. He has, in fact, released every internee whose release the Committee has recommended. 
I now want to make clear my views on the constitutional issue. I accept without reservation the position as established by the Ireland Act of 1949 that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland can only be sustained or changed by democratic methods and with majority consent. 
This proposition 
seems to me to be based both on morality and on commonsense. It also seems to me indisputable that, at this point in time, a majority wish to retain the constitutional link with Great Britain, and this being so I do not believe that active discussion of imminent change is realistic or profitable. However, I believe strongly that citizens here have the right by all legitimate peaceful and democratic means to advocate and to work for the ultimate unification of Ireland, if that is their aspiration; and the Prime Minister has assured me that he also affirms that right.

THERE IS NOW NO POSSIBILITY OF A GOVERNMENT CONSTITUTED AS AT 
PRESENT REGAINING AUTHORITY OR BEING ABLE TO ACT EFFECTIVELY. ONLY A GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF BOTH COMMUNITIES COULD END THIS SITUATION, AND AS POLITICAL INITIATIVES HAVE NOT BEEN KEEPING PACE WITH EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF EVEN THIS SOLUTION IS RAPIDLY DIMINISHING. 
IT IS DESPERATELY URGENT THAT THE NECESSARY STRUCTURAL CHANGES 
BE MADE (UNDERLINE FOLLOWING WORD) NOW TO PROVIDE AN ACTIVE PERMANENT AND GUARANTEED ROLE FOR THE MINORITY AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ADMINISTRATION 
- (FOLLOWING SIX WORDS UNDERLINED) INCLUDING THE 
LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT ITSELF. NO HALF MEASURES HAVE ANY CHANCE WHATEVER CF ACCEPTANCE, AND NO PREOCCUPATION WITH CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY IN RESPECT OF COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY IN PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE IMMEDIATE ADOPTION OF THE ONLY SOLUTION NOW OPEN. 
THOSE FROM THE REPUBLIC WERE EQUALLY UNANIMOUS IN THEIR ACCEPTANCE 
OF THIS ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND IN EXPRESSING THE FOLLOWING VIEWS ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC: 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE HAD A PROFOUND 
AND DEEPLY DISTURBING IMPACT IN THE REPUBLIC. THE STRENGTH OF SUPPORT FOR AND TOLERANCE OF IRA ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND - AND INDEED IN THE REPUBLIC ITSELF 
- HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY, 
STIMULATED FIRST BY INTERNMENT AND THEN BY REPORTS OF TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT OF THE INTERNEES AND DETAINEES, OF SHOOTING BY THE BRITISH ARMY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN IRA ACTIVISTS, AND OF THE BLOWING-UP OF BORDER ROADS AND REPEATED BORDER CROSSINGS AND INCIDENTS WITH IRISH POLICE OR ARMY. 
IF A POLITICAL SOLUTION IS NOT FOUND (NEXT WORD UNDERLINED) NOW IN NORTHERN IRELAND - AND THAT CAN BE DONE ONLY ON THE LINES OUTLINED 
EARLIER - THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC WILL, IT IS BELIEVED, 
DETERIORATE FURTHER AND THE ABILITY OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS TO CONTROL THIS SITUATION WILL BE SERIOUSLY WEAKENED.

7. If asked by the Press whether HMG has made any plans for the 
introduction of direct rule, the line to be taken will be that the Government undertakes planning on a contingency basis for a number of possible events: indeed we should be vulnerable to criticism if we did not have standby plans. But this does not mean that the events will happen. Review of internees 8. 
In the event a statement was not issued on Friday of last week 
about the number of cases of internees examined by Judge Brown’s review body but it is expected that the figures will be available today. They are expected to show that 110 cases have been reviewed and 10 internees have been recommended for release. 9. 
Some of the cases are taking a long time to prepare. The review 
body will meet as often as is necessary to avoid a backlog of prepared cases. At the moment they are planning to hold hearings three days a fortnight: the rest of the time between hearings is taken up with preparations for the hearings. It is possible that the review body will want to issue a statement at the end of each hearing rather than once a week as had been originally proposed. 
10. In order to complete the picture of the review body’s activities the 
Home Office will in future let interested departments, including No 10, have figures for the number of cases submitted to the review body. BBC Programme 1l. 
The BBC are planning to broadcast a discussion on the Talkback 
programme on whether their reporting of events in Northern Ireland is biased. They have asked the Ministry of Defence whether an Army spokesman could take part in the programme. It has been agreed that this would be highly undesirable and that the BBC’s request should be turned down.

You asked why Judge Brown’s Advisory Committee on 
Internment Appeals seemed to have come to a standstill. In fact, their work is continuing and the figures in the note which you saw (implying no increase in the number of cases considered over the past week) were incorrect. 64 cases have now been considered. 7 have been released (including 2 released today). They have decided not to release 48 and 9 cases are still pending. But the number of cases considered will continue to grow. The Committee say that the main limitation on their speed of working is the time taken by solicitors to prepare cases for submission to them.

As a result of intelligence from various sources 500 names In order to avoid the impression that there is any unnecessary 
delay in the review of the cases of internees the Home Office is considering whether the review body should be moved to make a further statement on the results of their activities. IRA morale 18. 
There are hints in recent intelligence assessments that IRA 
morale may be beginning to crack slightly as arrests and casualties continue at their present level. 19. 
Official There are also indications that the/IRA is losing young 
activists to the Provisionals and that the Provisionals as they take more and more casualties are concentrating more on reprisals. Alleged border incursions 20. 
In response to our requests for evidence to substantiate 
their claim that a British Army patrol crossed into the Republic on 19 October the Irish Government are sending a map in support of their version of the incident. 21. 
More generally, because disputes often arise between HMG and 
the Irish Government about the facts of border incidents, the Ministry of Defence is considering whether border patrols should be issued with cameras in order, where possible, to provide photograph evidence of incidents involving action from across the border. Compton Committee 22.

Guarding of RUC Stations Last night’s incident in which the RUC station at Larne was 
blown up has emphasised the need to establish as quickly as possible who should guard RUC stations. The Home Office are seeking directions from higher authority. One relevant point is whether it would be necessary for those 
guarding RUC stations to be issued with automatic weapons. The MOD are arranging for this to be pursued as quickly as possible. Review of Internees There has been no change in the number of cases reviewed in the 
last seven days. A total of 58 cases have been reviewed by Judge Brown so far. Forty-four have not had their release recommended; five were released on 19 October; and the remaining nine are still under review.

(B) THE RALLYING OF THE POPULATION BEHIND THE I R A ALONG THE BORDER AND THE REACTIONS TO INTERNMENT, ARE STRENGTHENING BOTH WINGS O THE I R A IN THE REPUBLIC AT THE EXPENSE OF DEMOCRATIC PARTIES AND INSTITUTIONS, NORTH AND SOUTH. (C) THERE WILL NEVER BE AN END TO THE TROUBLE IN THE NORTH UNTIL H.M.G. CEASES TO LEAVE THE BASIC DECISIONS CONCERNING IRELAND TO STORMONT AND MAKES ITS ON POSITION AND INTERESTS CLEAR. THESE ARE COMMON TO ALL THREE PARTIES, AND ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUALS RANGING FROM BLANEY TO CONOR CRUISE O’BRIEN DRAW DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS, THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE BEEN SUNK IN GLOOM DURING AND SINCE THE DAIL DEBATE, AS THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE VIRTUALLY POWERLESS: THEY BELIEVE THAT ONLY H.M.G. CAN BREAK THE DEADLOCK, AND THAT THE SITUATION NORTH AND SOUTH WILL CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE UNTIL THERE IS A MOVE FROM WESTMINSTER. 
4. EVERYONE HAS DENOUNCED VIOLENCE (ALTHOUGH BLANEY CAME DANGEROUSLY NEAR TO ADVOCATING IT) AND NOBODY EXPECTS OR WANTS AN EARLY END TO PARTITION. BUT NOBODY CAN SEE ANY BREAK IN THE CLOUDS IN THE NORTH, OR HOW TO STOP THE STORM SPREADING SOUTH, UNTIL H.M.G. TAKES A FRESH, 1971, LOOK AT IRELAND AND MAKES UP ITS OWN MIND. ALTHOUGH IN THE DEBATE SCARCELY ANYONE HAD A GOOD WORD TO SAY FOR US, SEVERAL MINISTERS AND OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE SINCE BEEN AT PAINS TO TELL ME THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BOUND IN PUBLIC TO ECHO PUBLIC RESENTMENT AND FRUSTRATION, THEY WERE REALLY APPEALING TO US TO TACKLE THE TROUBLE AT ITS SOURCE. SO WHILE THERE IS NO "ULTIMATUM’’ IT IS TRUE THAT THESE ARE THE BASIC ISSUES THAT MR. LYNCH WANTS TO DISCUSS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, AND SEES REAL DIFFICULTY IN HAVING A FURTHER MEETING UNLESS HE CAN.

and although what happens in the North is not directly my concern, I feel I am deeply enough involved in the Irish question to write about Ireland as a whole.

movement back to the old militant republican spirit and methods which, however appropriate to 1916-21 are outdated in 1971. This trend is eroding the position of Jac Lynch and the moderates, and the IRA and their sympathisers appear to be gaining in strength and audacity. This trend is due less to any increase in skill or numbers of either branch of the IRA than to a growing despair about our. methods of attempting to curb the seemingly endless violence in the North, and growing doubts about the utility of friendly contact with HMG on Northern affairs. I learned at Chequers that our friends are now astonished at the funds and scale of international organisation now supporting the IRA. Many of my diplomatic colleagues (mainly West Europeans) say their compatriots regard the bombing the accidental shooting of children by the British Army, Internment without trial, and the paralysis of public life in the North as a single incomprehensible whole, no part of which is either more or less to be condemned than any other. There have been indications tht the British electorate has had enough of the North. There seems, at least in Dublin, to be no hope for improvement. On the contrary the assumption is that the bloodshed and hatred will be Intensified, and more innocent people will die and more British soldiers will kill and be killed. Indeed during the period in which I have been thinking out and drafting this letter the tensions and hatred have perceptibly increased.

Ever since the eruption into violence of the Civil 
(i) The constitutional position of Ulster as part of the UK is not to be changed 
(ii) The Border (Partition) is not in dispute. 
(iii) Points (i) and (ii) stand until Stormont decides otherwise (i.e. votes for re-unification). 
(iv) A programme of reform must right the wrongs suffered by the Catholic minorities in Ulster. 
(v) Catholic political and public figures must be enabled and encouraged to play a full role in the public life of Ulster. 
(vi) In the face of violence from whatever quarter law and order have to be restored, even at the cost of a massive deployment of the British Army and the introduction of internment without trial. 
(vii) Finally the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic has been brought into consultation on Northern Ireland affairs, first bilaterally with Mr. Heath and then with Mr. Faulkner also participating. 
2. The position of the only other sovereign state involved, namely the Republic of Ireland, upon these issues is, at the time of writing, as follows:- 
(i) and (ii) 
Prime Minister believes that reunification will inevitably come 
Inacceptable in principle; the present about, peacefully and gradually. 
He is beginning to lose support for this "peaceful approach as the Northern situation deteriorates. 
(iii) Universally regarded as a fraud to perpetuate partition.

today with the prospects of a worse tomorrow. Unless anyone can claim confidently that the present programme will succeed in achieving its aims, it is reasonable to examine whether there is a mistake either in our political assumptions or in the conclusions drawn from them. For this we have to call in

show that HMG have put themselves in a false position in two particulars. First, the Border is doubly in dispute. Not only does the Government of the Irish Republic formally claim the Six Counties, while insisting that reunification should come gradually and by consent; but the IRA, whose terrorist activities are the dominant fact in the North, are not simply thugs and gangsters. They are the violent expression of Irish nationalism north and south, whose aim is to abolish the Border. It is only their methods which moderate Irishmen deplore. Thus a young couple who blow themselves up or a small child placing a bomb, in the eyes of the majority of the Irish are the modern martyrs and heroes. They deplore the necessity, but they would argue that it is forced upon the IRA by Unionist methods of suppressing the Catholics with our support. In this sense, so far from the Border not being in dispute, the dispute, and all that follows it, is about the Border. 
An objective and critical reappraisal as of 1971 might

Whatever successes the security forces may be 
There is no sign of any responsible Catholics in the North being prepared to enter into political talks. 
There is no visible or predictable point at which internment can come to an end. 
There is nothing in British or Northern Ireland policies which can help Mr. Inch to arrest the drift back to old-type republicanism. On the contrary the sanctity of the Border and its guardinship by Stormont have teen heavily underlined in Westminster and Belfast. 
13. 
theoretical way towards breaking the deadlock is by a negotiation between the sovereign governments of the UK and the Irish Republic relating to part of the territory of one (ie the Six Counties) and the whole of the other (the twentysix Counties) in the context of their entry into the Common Market. The republic would have to concede that de facto the Six Counties were British, and the Six Counties would have to lump the fact that their masters in Westminster, as they are fully entitled to do, were arranging their future for them. The aim would be the progressive harmonisation and

5. 10 wanted persons were arrested. They included a prominent 
member of 2 Brady Battalion, Belfast (Elliott) and the "transport officer" of the Goulding Battalion in Londonderry (Walmsely). Death of Anthony Nolan 6. 
Today’s newspapers carry reports of an announcement by the 
Provisional IRA about Anthony Nolan, whose death was mentioned in yesterday’s report. The announcement alleges that he was a member of the Provisionals and that he accidentally shot himself; a check is being made on the nature of the gunshot wound that caused his death, to see whether it is consistent with this claim. It has been established that Nolan had not been an internee, though he may have been released after being arrested, with or without having been detained. Alleged arrests of school-children 7. 
There has been some difficulty in establishing, with the RUC, 
the facts alleged in the ITN report on Tuesday evening; but the necessary information is in any case being assembled for PQs. Today’s Irish News attacks the Army for carrying out searches on children. Mental effects of Interrogation 8. 
Consideration is being given to how best to refute an article in 
the current New Scientist, and also other recent articles, which claim that insufficient attention was given by the authorities to the possible mental effects of the methods employed for interrogation in depth. The Minister of State for Defence will be provided with defensive material on this point for this evening’s adjournment debate. Times reporting 9. 
The Times has not yet retracted its statement suggesting that 
fatal casualties in Northern Ireland have out-stripped those of the Aden emergency. Also, today’s issue repeats the suggestiong that there have been official statements in recent weeks claiming that the IRA was on the brink of defeat 
- whereas such claims have been carefully avoided, except possibly by Northern Ireland Ministers.

9. A check has revealed that the Dutch authorities are not holding a warrant for the arrest of David O’Connell - in connection with the Amsterdam arms affair - and are therefore not likely to be approaching Eire for his extradition. Acquisition of buildings in Belfast 
10. Details are being worked out for the acquisition of about 90 abut 
houses which/Army poets and RUC stations in Northern Ireland nearly all in the Belfast area - so that they can be bricked-up or demolished as a safeguard against their being used for bomb attacks on the adjoining posts and stations - of which there have already been 7, killing 4 policemen and 3 soldiers, and causing 14 serious injuries. (A few such acquisitions have already taken place,) Most of the houses in question are deserted, and many of them derelict, but in about 20 cases there are occupants who will have to be re-housed A few of them may have to be evicted; the propaganda potential of this is being carefully watched. There are some financial points to be settled but these are not being allowed to cause delay where the operational case for acquisition is clear. Visit of Mr. Lynch to London 11. Mr. Lynch, who was originally inclined to avoid any encounter at all with British Ministers during his unofficial visit to London today, accepted on Friday that it would be thought very surprising if he did not have a brief courtesy meeting with the Prime Minister. His acceptance is reflected in the Irish newspapers. Internment Matters 12. Initial discussions with the Northern Ireland Government, conducted at the end of last week, indicated that they were likely to accept the need for changes both in the legal forms relating to internment (e.g. in the direction of informing the internee of the grounds for interning him) and in the administrative treatment of those in internment (e.g. in the direction of segregating the hard-

iners). The area of greatest difficulty at present, straight forward 
as it may seem, is to extract a definite view from the Northern Ireland Government of the amount of extra accommodation, and the numbers of extra prison staff, which they expect to need in the short term in order to cope with the increasing number of people being interned. The Sunday Times 13. There appears to be a welcome improvement in the attitude of the Sunday Times in its treatment of Northern Ireland 
- and in particular a more realistic view of the true character of the IRA.

Mr. Faulkner thanked the Home Secretary for his co-operation in securing 
Sir Charles Cunningham’s enquiry into security at Crumlin Road. The Governor of the prison had told him that he was convinced that there had been no collusion, but there had been carelessness. Internment was producing information so rapidly that accommodation was becoming crowded. The army were thinking of using McGilligan Camp for internees. Assistance in providing staff might be needed. Perhaps the new camp could be staffed from Britain. 
It was pointed out 
that senior officials from the Home Office Prison Department were to visit Northern Ireland to discuss more precisely what assistance the Northern Ireland Government sought. The Home Secretary told Mr. Faulkner that the United Kingdom Government 
had decided to keep Sydenham operating beyond 1973. It would operate on a reduced basis so far as military personnel were concerned, but there would not be redundancies affecting civil employment. Mr. Faulkner welcomed this decision and expressed his appreciation for the understanding shown by the Ministers concerned. The Home Secretary told Mr. Faulkner that he proposed that Sir Edmund Compton 
be asked to carry on dealing with complaints from persons arrested with a view to internment. This, together with the arrangements which were being made for a Board of Visitors to hear complaints of people once they were received into prison, should fill the gap which had been criticised. Sir Edmund Compton would be asked to consider complaints made by the person concerned, but not required to deal with complaints made at second-hand. He would enquire into the action of the army or the R.U.C. Mr. Faulkner agreed with this proposal. There was some discussion on whether the Board of Visitors could consider complaints by detainees as well as internees.

The Home Secretary said that he had agreed that the R.U.C. should be 
provided with automatic weapons to guard police stations where the army were unable to provide protection. He was not disposed to agree to the use of automatic weapons by police officers on the streets. Mr. Faulkner said that he supported the Chief Constable’s proposal that mobile patrols should have machine-gun support if necessary. Unless the police had this protection they might not respond to emergency calls in difficult areas. It was not proposed that automatic weapons should be used other than on mobile patrols. Mr. Faulkner said that the G.O.C. supported this proposal. The Home Secretary referred to arrangements which had been made at local initiative whereby a soldier with an automatic weapon sometimes accompanied an R.U.C. patrol. The Ministry of Defence has now made arrangements so that this practice would be encouraged, though it would be wrong to suggest that all cases would be covered. The army was also providing protection for vehicles. The Home Secretary said that much of the criticism in the recent debate 
had centred on procedures for internment. If these could be modified it would be easier to retain support for the principle of internment itself. Mr. Faulkner said that this was under active consideration. He had it in mind that an internee might be told in writing of the allegation against him: the statement would be on the lines that he was a member of an unlawful association, or actively involved in the recent campaign of violence. The Home Secretary asked whether the statement would give such detail as the type of illegal organisation - Brady or Goulding - to which it was alleged that the individual belonged. Mr. Faulkner said that he was disinclined to go into such detail. Mr. Faulkner said that Judge Brown’s Committee might consider cases in two stages, with lawyers admitted to one but not to the other. The Home Secretary suggested that Judge Brown’s Committee might be expanded in view of the large amount of work for them to do. A Commonwealth Judge might be included: it might even be necessary for panels to be formed. Mr. Faulkner said that he would speedily put forward a package of proposals for revamping the internment procedures for the Home Secretary to consider.

place north or south of the border. Coverage of Northern Ireland in the Times 6. 
An article in today’s issue of the Times, which puts the out- 
break of IRA activity last weekend into its correct prospective, reflects the efforts which have been made to educate the Press on this subject. 7. 
A letter has been sent to the Times, pointing out the incorrect 
nature of its statements on 29 November about the number of Army deaths and alleged official claims of imminent victory from the IRA. The letter has not been published in today’s issue; if it is still not published tomorrow, consideration will be given to reporting the fact to the Press Association. Internee Accommodation 8. 
The Home Office are checking whether the increase in the number 
of internees has become so steep as to necessitate the provision of extra internee accommodation in the short term 
- in which case it may be necessary to use HS MAIDSTONE again - and to call for 
additional prison staff. Evidence for the Parker Committee 9. 
Further thought is being given to the correct balance to be 
struck, in the Government’s evidence for the Privy Councillors regarding the justification for interrogation methods. between on the one hand the need to safeguard the prisoners themselves and the interrogators and, on the other hand, the importance of discipline and a measure of stress if interrogation is to be successful. Commission for Human Rights 10. Although Mr. Cunningham’s PNQ about the basis for the Irish Government’s submission to the Commission for Human Rights, in respect of alleged brutality in Northern Ireland, was disallowed, further Questions covering the same ground can be expected. More-over, as the Commission’s enquiries proceed, it will be necessary for

departments to produce a good deal of detailed information for the preparation of HMG’s case. So far, the Irish Government’s handling of the matter - in presentational terms 
- has not been particularly 
adroit and has received a cool Press. Visit of Mr. Lynch to London on 6 December 11. It now seems definite that Mr. Lynch intends to visit London on Monday 6 December to take up the invitation to lunch with, and address, the Press Gallery. As regards the lunch itself, the normal drill on these occasions is not to include a question time - though it is open to the guest to offer to answer questions. More generally, the visit seems bound to attract quite a lot of attention, though the indications are that Mr. Lynch is not himself stimulating such interest and does not intend to hold a Press conference or be interviewed for television. 12. It appears also that Mr. Lynch will not take the lead in seeking any informal meeting with Ministers in London. It is in any case doubtful an overt meeting would be advisable at present; but a short private encounter within the precincts of Parliament is for consideration. Lord Balniel, who had been invited to the same Press Gallery lunch, has decided nbt to attend. 13. The Home Office are checking a rumour that Mr. Faulkner also intends to visit London on 6 December. (Co-incidentally, the GOC NI is due to pay a routine visit to London on the same day.) Future of RNAY Sydenham 14. The Minister of State for Defence has concluded that it would be a mistake to go ahead with previously announced plans to close the Royal Naval Aircraft Repair Yard, Sydenham (Belfast) 
- and has 
directed that it should remain in operation, though with some reduction in the work force, leaving about 650 jobs in being.

were 4 shooting incidents in Belfast (in one in Londonderry. A search forarms in the Ballymacarrett area of Belfast yielded 4 rifles, 4 carbines, 2 SMGs, 3 pistols and 2,800 rounds of ammunition. Rate of prosecutions 6. A check is being made of how many of those persons on the wanted list who are arrested are being prosecuted for any offences 
- whether under the Special Powers 
Act or for other criminal offences. Extradition from Eire 7. Although hardly any applications for the extradition of wanted people known to be in Eire prove successful, the mere fact that the application has been made can be of presentational value (though it is important not to refer to such applications in a Ministerial speech, unless and until they have proved unsuccessful; since to do so may lend support to arguments that the applications are politically inspired 
- a point not always observed by Northern Ireland Ministers). 
To be able to point to applications for extradition which have been refused on patently inadequate grounds may be particularly useful if the Dublin Government shows more pronounced signs of trying to pillory the United Kingdom before world opinion 
- e.g. by pursuing its objections to interrogation methods before the Council of Europe. 
8. In this connection, a check is being made on whether one of the leading personalties in the affair of the arms consignment brought to light in Amsterdam, O’ Connell 
- who is known to be at large in the Reublic (and who was seen briefly north of the border during the weekend) - is wanted by either the Netherlands or 
the Northern Ireland authorities; and, if so, whether the Government concerned should be pressed to apply for his extradition.

INTERNMENT PROCEDURES At the meeting last Monday (GEN 47(71)8th Meeting), the Prime Minister 
asked us to look yet again at the possibility of devising a system under which the bulk of internees could be brought to trial. As you know, I have noW had a talk with the Attorney General on this matter and with Mr Dalton who is a member the Judge Brown’s Advisory. Committee and a former Kenyan judge. There are two difficulties 
- and the Attorney General and Mr Dalton both 
think that they are insuperable. First, the reason for interment is simply that while a good 
deal is known about active IRA members, the evidence, such as it is, 
would not inimost cases stand up in court. Examples are attached of the kind of information which is known about individuals. Much of it is simply not up to the standards of evidence required in the courts. Secondly, even if the evidence did stand up, there are obvious and overriding objections to disclosing its nature to the defence or arranging for a confrontation between the security services and the person involved 
- which is the minimum of that is required for the hearing 
to be described as being in any way before a court. Wesshould put individuals in peril; and prejudice the sources of the information. Even if the case were held in camera, the defence would still know. The Attorney General cannot see how any moral accusatorial procedure could work. This is also the view of Mr Dalton, He said that the evidence put before the Advisory Committee by Special Branch was adequate to enable the Committee to reach a judgment, but that it would not convince a court. If we want to keep the internees under restraint, and he thought we should, he could see no alternative to the present interment 
The Northern Ireland Labour Party came to see us yesterday, to discuss 
interment. They take the view that internment as such has poisoned the political atmosphere but admitted 
that there was a deep cleavage on this within their on party, many maintaining that internment was unavoidable. Their only suggestion

was the setting up of some form of Commission which would review the reasons for internment and the procedure which has so far been adopted. They had little hope that the Commission would be able to suggest any new procedures, but thought that if HNG and the Northern Ireland Government were to take the initiative in reviewing interrment, this might in itself create sufficient goodwill to enable other political initiatives to be taken. There are I think some improvements which might be made to the interrment 
appeal procedure for example, by allowing legal representation of internees at the hearing - but this would be little more than window dressing and would be regarded as tinkering. I remain much disturbed by all this. Unless we can make some gesture 
on interrment, it is difficult to see how the talks can get started. But I simply don’t see how we can abandon internment at this stage. The Attorney General and Mr Dalton only confirm our view however that the alternative of beinging the men to trial is not the answer.

28 June 
ARREST POLICY The policy to be followed oh the making of arrests was worked out and 
agreed with the security forces on Monday. The emphasis is on arresting people only if they are wanted in connection with criminal offences but Regulation 11 (1) under the Special Powers Act may be used in certain circumstances. The instructions to members of the security forces on the policy to be adopted will be given orally. OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The violence up to midnight on Monday was presumably designed to show 
that the Provisionals were not calling a truce out of weakness. Since then the violence, especially explosions, has lessened. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is seeing representatives of the Ulster Defence Association today. PUBLIC RELATIONS 3. 
Press reports have already attempted to show that members of the security 
forces are depressed about the truce and what is portrayed as their inability to retaliate against violence. 4. 
The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office will liaise on the 
line to be taken in reply to these suggestions, and, in particular, the possibility of stimulating an article setting out the contribution which the security forces have made towards the bringing about of a truce. 5. 
The Ministry of Defence will consider what might be done within the Army 
to make sure it is known that the Army’s efforts are appreciated and that present policies are understood: the recent message from the Commander Land Forces has already addressed itself to this problem.

At tomorrow’s meeting you will no doubt wish to ask:- 
(a) The Vice Chief of the General Staff to report on the security situation following the "ceasefire" by the IRA. 
2. 
(b) The Secretary of State to assess the developing political situation. The following questions may be relevant:- 
(i) Is the "ceasefire" being effectively observed by the IRA? Are the 
sporadic shooting and bombing incidents thought to originate from other sources or to be the result of inadequate control by the Provisional leaders? (ii) What policy are the security forces observing as regards the general In particular, what are their instructions regarding 
level of their activity? 
the arrest of wanted men? And what is the position in the Bogside and Creggan? (iii) What is the risk that the UDA will erect barricades or proclaim 
"no-go" areas in Protestant districts over the coming weekend? (iv) Are there any indications of a Protestant "backlash" otherwise than 
from the UDA? What is Mr. Faulkner’s current position? (v) What has the Secretary of State in mind as regards the release of 
internees in the coming weeks? (vi) Is it yet possible to assess the prospects for- and the timing of 
the projected constitutional conference? In particular, are there any indications that the IRA will insist on direct representation, under threat of renewing their campaign of violence if their demand is not met? And how do we stand with Mr. Lynch in this context? (vii) Has the Secretary of State yet been able to form a definite view about 
the timing of a Border plebiscite in relation to the conference? (viii) Separately (arising from the discussion at the last meeting) when can 
we expect the completion of the investigations into allegations of brutality by the RUC?

23 June 1972 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 16 June 1972 
- 22 June 1972 
1. Although the week has been violent it has ended in the Provisional IRA’s declaration of a cease-fire from midnight on 26 June. The reaction from the various political parties in Northern Ireland has been cautious: most are waiting to see what further steps are taken following the ceasefire. 
MR WHITELAW 
2. Mr Whitelaw, in a television broadcast on 16 June, called on the people of Northern Ireland to help him create a real and lasting peace and to draw back from the danger of sectarian confluct. He repeated his pledge that the Border would not be changed without their consent, and stressed that there would have to be an end soon to the campaign of civil disobedience. There would also have to be an end to the no-go areas. Independent areas would not be permitted to offer shelter for those who planned death and destruction to the innocent. 
THE HUNGER STRIKE 
3. A number of prisoners in Crumlin Road have been on hunger strike, demanding political status. It was announced on Monday that some prisoners would be moved to Long Kesh. This would make separate accommodation available at Crumlin Road, for those serving sentences for certain offences. The men involved later called off the hunger strike. 
THE PROVISIONAL IRA 
4. Reports appearing at the weekend that Sean MacStiofain had been replaced by David O’Connell as leader of the Provisionals were denied by the movement. 
5. On 22 June, the leaders of the Provisional IRA issued a statement as follows:- 
"The Irish Republican Army will suspend offensive operations as and from midnight Monday, June 26, provided that a public reciprocal response is forthcoming from the Armed Forces of the British Crown.

Wednesday. An intensive gun battle took place in the Andersonstown area of Belfast on Wednesday evening, and shooting started again at midday on Thursday. The security forces suffered no casualties, though some hits were claimed. 
11. Bombing incidents appear to be concentrated on the border and rural areas. The Londonderry Guildhall was again the scene of an explosion on Friday when a 50 lb bomb exploded there. A 150 lb car bomb exploded outside a Protestant owned bar on the edge of the Shankill on Saturday. A warning had been given, and there were only minor casualties. Later the same day, an 80 lb bomb exploded in a derelict house next to a Catholic bar in Ballymurphy. There were only minor casualties. Three members of the Gordon Highalanders were killed when a booby-trap exploded while they were searching a house near Lurgan. Five others were wounded. Extensive damage was caused to a garage near Strabane when a 20 lb bomb exploded there at the weekend, while a factory in the Ardoyne was also damaged by explosions on Sunday. Other explosions in Claudy, Newry, Killea, Co Fermanagh, Strabane, Ballymena and Dungiven appeared to be particularly directed towards official buildings and electrical installations. Customs posts were either damaged or destroyed in Killea, Co Londonderry, Pettigoe, Co Fermanagh, and Ballydonnell and Carnagh, Co Armagh. 
12. A Northern Resistance Movement march through Belfast in support of the hunger strikers was dispersed without trouble. A search operation carried out in andersonstown on Friday led to a violent reaction. Barricades were erected and troops came under fire twice, but the area was quiet by the evening.

b. Ballymurphy. There were six shooting incidents but the Security Forces were not involved. There was an intersectarian disturbance between groups of hooligans in the Donegall Roundabout area. The Catholic youths then stoned troops between 2100hrs and 2145hrs and 27 baton rounds were fired to disperse them. 
c. Falls. There were no shooting incidents. Between 1809hrs and 1850hrs three home made mortar bomb were fired into the Alber Street Mill location from the South. They all failed to explode. The funeral of Mackin took place peacefully and was attended by 800 people. James Walsh(16) of Little Grovenor Street was arrested and remanded in custody. He is suspected of being a gunman and a telescopic sight for a .22 rifle, a pair of binoculars and a book on small arms was found in his house. 
d. Ardoyne. There were five shooting incidents all involving Security Forces. A NCO was wounded in the thigh, but not seriously. Fire was returned three times and one hit was claimed. Between 1945hrs and 2200hrs about 150 UDA marched in uniform to Crumlin Road Jail. At the jail the crowd grew to 400 and they protested about Mr whitelaw and his lack of sympathy for the Loyalist cause. Billy McKee (the hunger striker) was returned to Crumlin Jail.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SDLP REPRESENTATIVES (MR HUME AND MR DEVLIN) AT STORMONT CASTLE AT 12 30 PM ON MONDAY, 19 JUNE 
The Secretary of State said that he had now arranged for the proposed meeting with representatives of the Provisionals to take place at the house of Colonel M W McCorkell. As requested by the Provisionals, it would be on Tuesday, 20 June, at a time to be agreed. He had decided that he should be represented by a senior official and one other official. This would avoid difficulties and delays in briefing an outside emissary. The senior representative would be Mr P J Woodfield, Deputy Under Secretary of State, who would be fully empowered to state the Secretary of State’s position but not to enter into negotiations. He would arrange for Mr Gerald Adams to be released from detention (not internment). On the question of harassment, it might be necessary to ask the Provisionals to ensure that certain named individuals were not seen in Northern Ireland. This would avoid the difficulty that knowledge of the arrangements being made had to be carefully limited to as small a number of persons as possible. He hoped it would be possible to make early arrangements to accommodate the "political" prisoners separately and to allow them to wear their own clothes. This would take a little while. Meanwhile the question arose of the timing of a statement. If the concession were granted in advance of the meeting with the Provisionals they might make further demands. 
The SDLP representatives said that it would be helpful if the announcement could be made in advance. It could be presented as a step towards the lowering of tension in the prison. They were confident that the Provisionals would not seek to make further demands. If the Secretary of State agreed to the proposition in respect of harassment, details of which would be given at the meeting, and in respect of the treatment of the prisoners, the Provisionals would further ask only that he should agree to meet them at a further meeting. The Provisionals attached considerable importance to this. The SDLP representatives were confident that the Provisionals would stick to the bargain, although the situation would be complicated by the reaction of the Officials and the UDA. There remained some elements who would be determined to ensure that the peace initiatives did not succeed. The question of enforcement of the cease fire might be discussed at the meeting with the Provisionals.

In discussion the Secretary of State said that the ending of violence was the key to the situation. Before commiting himself to a meeting he would need evidence that the Provisionals intended and were able to keep to the agreement. Moreover a further meeting would have to be held under the aegis of the SDLP whose position would otherwise be undermined. The next meeting ought again to be with officials. But once the violence had genuinely ended a new situation would arise when a number of other issues, including internment, the ’no go’ areas and civil disobedience, would need to be discussed. He did not rule out the possibility of a meeting between himself and those who had forsaken violence and were concerning themselves solely with political activities. The SDLP representatives said that they realised that the cease fire would have to be seen to be genuine; but it might be dangerous to try to leave a meeting with the Secretary of State for as long as four weeks. 
In further discussion the Secretary of State said that if violence genuinely ended the possibility of ending internment quickly woulc arise. At least for presentational reasons it might be necessary for some of the internees to be detained and charged in the normal way. The SDLP representatives said that in their view this would be disastrous. The establishment of the Provisionals had been a spontaneous reaction by the Catholic community to the events of 1969. There would be no real peace unless the internees were finally released. They were confident that if the internees were released on the ending of violence, violence would not be resumed. 
It was agreed that a press statement on the meeting should be agreed between the SDLP representatives and Mr McDowall, drawing attention in particular to discussions on the position of the "political" prisoners.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SDLP REPRESENTATIVES (MR HUME AND MR DEVLIN) AT THE OFFICE OF THE UK REPRESENTATIVE AT 12 20 PM ON SUNDAY, 18 JUNE 1972 
Mr Hume said that he and Mr Devlin had discussed with MacStiofain and O’Connell the possibility of an immediate cease fire. In response MacStiofain and O’Connell had asked that the Secretary of State should meet O’Connell and Gerald Adams, at present interned, on neutral ground. The Provisionals’ delegates intended to propose to the Secretary of State that he should give an assurance that there would be no harassment by the security forces (by which he appeared to mean no "lifting" for offences committed up to the date of the cease fire) and that there should be recognition of the demands of the "political" prisoners. In return the Provisionals would publicly declare an immediate and indefinite cease fire. The SDLP representatives said that they found it difficult to believe the rumours of a split in the ranks of the Provisionals. O’Connell himself had said that it was not true. Both O’Connell and MacStiofain were fully committed to the proposed meeting and the Provisionals’ delegates would be fully empowered to reach agreement. For all their terrorist activities, such an agreement would be honoured by the Provisionals. But the SDLP representatives urged the Secretary of State to respond quickly to the invitation; any delay would give MacStiofain and other extremists a chance to break away and re-assert their dominance. There was, say, a 10 per cent risk that the meeting would become public knowledge before it took place. If it subsequently became public knowledge the cease fire would already have been declared. In any event the risk was worth taking. They had consulted the Provisionals about the possibility of an intermediary attending a meeting on behalf of the Secretary of State, but this had been rejected. 
The Secretary of State said that he had to preserve the position of the SDLP as the elected representatives of the people. Any discussions would therefore have to be conducted under their "banner"; the position of the SDLP would otherwise be undermined. There should be no difficulty in reaching agreement about "harassment". It would not be possible to give prisoners "political" status, but they could be accommodated in a separate compound and they could probably be allowed to wear their own clothes and perhaps to receive additional letters and

visits. It would however be extremely difficult for him to attend the proposed meeting at this stage particularly if it proved unsuccessful. The Prov.isionals ought to realise this and be prepared to accept the attendance on behalf of the Secretary of State of someone of known public standing who could not be repudiated. There could be no question of negotiations; if a cease fire were achieved a new situation would arise. 
In discussion the SDLP said that they thought the Secretary of State’s proposal in respect of "political" prisoners would be acceptable. They accepted that it would be difficult for the Secretary of State to attend the meeting. But they were concerned at the delay in arranging for an intermediary. There would be no prospect of an unannounced cease fire taking effect in the meantime. There would be the risk thaty extremist groups would not respect an unannounced cease fire; moreover there was an additional group - 
Saor Eire - engaging in terrorist activities. 
In further discussion it was agreed that the SDLP should consult the Provisionals on whether they would be prepared to see an emissary who would be able to produce a document signed by the Secretary of State saying that he was authorised to speak onbehalf of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State said that meanwhile he would consult the Prime Minister. 
Later 
The Secretary of State said that he had consulted the Prime Minister who had agreed that the Secretary of State should be represented by an emissary at this stage. If this were not acceptable to the Provisionals he would need to consult the Cabinet about the possibility of his attendance. 
Later 
The SDLP representatives said that they had consulted O’Connell and it had been agreed that the Secretary of State should be represented by an emissary. He would need to be accompanied by one of the Secretary of State’s officials in confirmation of his authority to speak on behalf of the Secretary of State. 
It was agreed that the publicly announced meeting between the Secretary n

incident in the Ardoyne area had been a great shock to them as well as to everyone else. He had given the Protestant community repeated assurances on the Border; but they remained anxious for their position to be understood. They also wanted assurances that the security forces were prepared actively to pursue gunmen. The "no go" areas in Londonderry were a continuing affront to the Protestant community although many of them failed to appreciate the issues and had never been to Londonderry. In his talks with the UDA he had made it clear that a military operation in the "no go" areas would be possible, but that this would result in serious casualties and in particular would lead to bitterness that would last many years. He had also made it clear that the withdrawal of social security benefits would be undesirable. He had not ruled out the possibility of a defensive cordon around the "no go" areas to prevent terrorists from using it as a haven from which to carry on their activities. 
In discussion on the ending of violence the SDLP representatives said that the Provisionals would not respond to pleas or argument; they needed to be exposed to political pressures. If the Secretary of State took the risk of a complete end to internment the pressures on the Provisionals to end violence would be irresistible. There would then also be an opportunity to end civil disobedience and to undertake positive talks on the opening of the "no go" areas. It was a risk worth taking. The Secretary of State said that he could not risk ending internment without an end of violence. If major acts of terrorism took place after the ending of internment his position would be impossible. If there were a genuine end of terrorism,even for a limited period, there would be a genuine response from the Governmentand,subject to consultations with his colleagues, he did not rule out the ending of internment in these circumstances. 
In discussion on the "no go" areas of Londonderry the SDLP said that the problem was essentially political. There was no difficulty in entering the areas, many people did so without harrassment every day. The Secretary of State said that arrangements had been made for the Londonderry Commission to proceed with community projects in the Bogside The next step might be for him or a junior Minister to visit the sites and inspect the work actually being done. This would help to break down the mythology of the "no go" areas. Another possibility would be

the removal of troops from the Blighs Lane Army Post in return for the removal of, say, two substantial barricades through which the security 
forces would continue to have access. that this was a possibility wich appealed 
The SDLP representatives said them. They would give it 
further thought with a view to discussing it again it another meeting. They urged that nothing should be done meanwhile about the erection of a defensive cordon around the "no go" areas. It would be inflammatory and lead to a serious deterioration in the situation. The Secretary of State said that he would not take any immediate action in respect of 
a 
In further discussion the SDLP said that a major move towards progress would be to make special arrangements for those prisoners in the Crumlin Road and Armagh Prisons who were claiming. "political" status. If they could not be given such status it would help if they were in a separate compound, were allowed to wear their own clothing and were not required to do penal work. The Secretary of State said that "political" status and the wearing of ciilian clothing would not be possible. He did not rule out the possibility of a separate compound, perhaps at Long Kesh. The SDLP said that Long Kesh should be avoided because of its emotional associations with internment. Mr Hume undertook to produce a list of those prisoners who, in their view, would qualify for "special" treatment. 
In further discussion both sides agreed that there should be a further meeting at 12.15 on Monday 19 June in Stormont Castle. The Secretary of State invited the SDLP to consider whether Mr Fitt should attend. It was agreed that the SDLP should also consider whether they might be accompanied by someone who might be able to exress the Provisionals’ point of view. The Secretary of State would have to know who the other person was in advance since he could not see a Provisional and he would, if necessary, have to deny all knowledge that the additional person represented other interests. The SDLP emphasised that they personally could not speak for the Provisionals and would not be recognised by the Provisionals as able to do so. 
It was agreed that short statements should be issued to the effect that there had been full and frank discussions between the two sides and that a further meeting would be held early next week.

Note of meeting on 16th June 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The political and security situations have changed markedly in the last few days. Although the UDA were concerned at the rate of release of internees, they have following the meeting with Mr Whitelaw 
barracades for 14 days, and to prevent the Tartan gangs from creating disorder. 2. Firm rejection of the ultimatum from the IRA provisionals has reassured the majority community. The SDLP are having talks with Mr Whitelaw, leaving the IRA provisionals in political isolation. Whether the provisionals will stop their campaign of violence, or resort to even more desperate measures, is impossible to foretell. The SDLP have chosen Messrs Hume and Devlin as their representatives. Mr Fitt is being seen separately. 
3. The Government is launching a political initiative with 2 main points. Local Government elections later this year will be held under a system of proportional representation, using the single transferable vote; and the Government are to have talks with interested parties with a view to holding a round-table conference on the political future of Northern Ireland. The initiative has been well received. A critical question is the extent to which the views of either wing of the IRA should be expressed at an eventual conference. There can certainly be no direct dealing with the provisional IRA while violence continues, but history suggests that the United Kingdom Government has, in the context of other political settlements, had some contact with those who have participated in extremist activities. A close study is being made of examples. 
4. The attitude of the Government of the Republic of Ireland to events in the North, and to developments at Westminster, continues to be of great importance. They have been told that as matters stand the IRA cannot be admitted to any round-table

NOTE OF A MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA 
On the intructions of the Secretary of State I met representatives of the Provisional IRA at 3 pm on Tuesday, 20 June. The meeting took place at Ballyarnett, a house near the Donegal border owned by Colonel M W McCorkell. The Colonel and Mrs McCorkell were in the house at the time. 
2. The IRA representatives were Mr David O’Connell and 
Mr Gerard Adams. I was accompanied by Mr Frank Steele. 3. 
Before the discussions proper started I was introduced to 
a third person, Mr P J McGrory who was described as a solicitor and a wholly independent person. It had been arranged that I should carry with me a note signed by the Secretary of State to say that I was an authorised representative. This note is in the following terms: 
"The bearer of this note, Mr P J Woodfield, is a senior official in my Department. He has full authority to explain my position on the three points which have been put to me. 
He is being accompanied by Mr Steele, another official in my Department. 
(signed) William Whitelaw Secretary of State for Northern Ireland" 
Mr McGrory’s function appeared to be to scrutinise this note and by virtue of his legal powers he pronounced it authentic and then withdrew. 
4. We began the meeting with a statement from me outlining the 
position of the Provisional IRA as reported to the Secretary of State which was as follows: 
The IRA were prepared to call an indefinite cease fire if they could be satisfied that the Secretary of State would accept the demand of certain convicted prisoners for "political status"; that he would immediately order the cessation of all harassment of the IRA; and that he would be prepared after the cease fire had been shown to be effective to meet representatives of the Provisional IRA.

5. They did not directly challenge the accuracy of this as 
their position. Turning to the specific matters which they raised I said that the Secretary of State could not concede the demand for political status for convicted prisoners. Quite apart from any other considerations, this was not a concept known to the law and the Secretary of State could therefore not give effect to it. He was however prepared to consider representations from any quarter about specific matters affecting the treatment of prisoners and had in fact already made certain arrangements which were sufficiently satisfactory to the prisoners themselves for them to have called off their hunger strike as had been announced on the news. I suggested that the substance of what was being asked for under this head was virtually the position as it now was. 
6. Mr O’Connell said that he broadly accepted this, but 
there was some doubt as to whether the report that the hunger strike had been called off was true. He asked if I would at once telephone the Governor of Belfast Prison and ask for a named prisoner to come to the telephone to give a personal report to Mr O’Connell on whether or not the hunger strike had been called off. 
7. I pointed out that it had been agreed that our meeting 
should be completely secret and that for me to do what he asked would cause an immediate leak and that there was no prospect that he would be able to get the Governor to bring the prisoner to the telephone to talk to Mr O’Connell. 
8. I then turned to the second question which had been 
put - if a cease fire were called would the Secretary of State stop the harassment of the Provisional IRA. I said that harassment was a vague term and meant different things to different people. After discussion of various examples I said that it seemed that what the two representatives were asking for was an assurance that the security forces would not take the opportunity of a cease fire to pick up men whom they had been unable to get while the campaign was on. They agreed that this was their position and I said that the Secretary of State was prepared to give an assurance on this point which would mean that raids, searches and arrests to look for people wanted for their past activities would not take place. They raised one subsidiary point; many members of their organisation remained in fear of being attacked and had been accustomed to carrying concealed side-arms. If they were stopped and found to be carrying arms would they be arrested? I said that this was a question which I would report back but that the object was to produce a situation as soon as possible when people no longer thought they needed to carry firearms and that if persons were going about on normal peaceful business they would not be subject to arbitrary stopping and searching.

13. The IRA then asked if the Northern Ireland Office would be prepared to use their good offices to introduce them to representativesof the UDA. They clearly recognised the UDA as a potentially dangerous power centre in Northern Ireland and implied that if a meeting could be effected they might get along better than some people would expect. 
14. We on our side raised a number of points designed to ensure that if a cease fire was declared it should be effective. First we told them not to draw any immediate and irrevocable conclusions from any action by the security forces which appeared to them to be contrary to the Secretary of State’s assurances. If they thought they were being tricked they should make immediate contact with the Northern Ireland Office and put their grievances and wait for our response. If they remained dissatisfied they would have to draw for themselves the consequences of reverting to violent activity but if they were sincere in their desire for a cease fire and an end to violence they should be concerned to ensure that it did not start again by a misunderstanding. They welcomed this and an initial line of contact (through the former office of the UK Representative) was arranged. They went on to say that they would welcome local points of contact and they for their part believed that once the cease fire had been shown to be genuine they would have no difficulty in liaising with the Army by pointing out possible danger spots. They said that although they could enforce a cease fire on the part of their officers and volunteers they were worried about the activities of teenagers and school children. They admitted that violence against the Army frequently started by stone throwing by children and that the opportunity was then taken to escalate the violence to shooting; they offered to submit a list of places where they thought the risk was greatest and asked if the Army could avoid them at times when children tended to congregate. We replied that any specific proposal genuinely designed to help could be carefully considered but that there could be no undertaking that the Army would simply avoid being in areas listed by the IRA. 
15. We next pointed out the danger of any pre-set booby traps. A cease fire would be completely wrecked if it were followed by a booby trap killing British soldiers; it would be no adequate defence to say that it had been set before the cease fire. They took note of this point appearing to recognise its force but not knowing whether or not they had any such time bombs.

16. We then said that a number of members of their organisation were well known not only by name but by sight and that the prospects of the cease fire leading to permanent peace depended very largely on these people lying low; we gave one or two examples and they replied that if people of this kind were to strut about in Protestant areas this would be an act of provocation. 
17. The meeting had now lasted 2 hours and Mr 0 Connell and Mr Adams then asked if they could have a short period on their own. When we rejoined them they went over the ground and confirmed the basis on which the discussion had taken place, namely that we were only authorised, except when referring to Hi’s publically stated position, to deal with the three questions which had been put in advance to the Secretary of State. They said that having met us they were personally satisfied that where we said we were authorised to speak expressly on behalf of the Secretary of State we were so authorised: but other members of their organisation had not met us and they said that in the whole context of Irish history they were bound to fear that they might be being tricked. Would it be possible for the Secretary of State to set out in writing his response to the three questions which had been put? We replied that for the Secretary of State to send them a letter of this kind would be politically wholly impossible; he would have no control over the letter or the use made of it. They saw the validity of this and it was eventually proposed that Mr McGrory who had been present when we first met should be invited to call at a convenient place and see a written statement signed by the Secretary of State covering the three points. When the three points were once again summarised the reference to the political prisoners had been dropped and a new one introduced - namely that "liaison would be established, initially between a member of the Secretary of State’s staff, and a representative of the IRA, with the object of making the cease fire work". As this was an arrangement which the Secretary of State had instructed us to obtain if possible we made no comment on the fact that it had now become a condition by the IRA to a cease fire. We said that we could not commit the Secretary of State to this proposal to use Mr McGrory but that we would immediately convey it to him. 
18. We then broached the question of the timing of a cease fire. Mr O’Connell suggested the weekend. We emphasised strongly the dangers of delay. Mr O’Connell replied that he and Mr Adams were not 
and would have to refer back 
and that they would need some time to give advance warning down the line. We were not able at this stage to get them to agree to advance the time before Friday.

bar were both blown up in Belfast and the Bligh’s Lane post in Derry had another gunbattle on Saturday. Interest has again centred on the political front with 
the Dublin inspired report that Stephenson had been replaced as Provisional Chief of Staff by David O’Connell. This was subsequently denied. There has been wore speculation about a Provisional ceasefire and Bernadette Devlin has joined the ranks of those calling for a end to violence. Meanwhile a possible source of a violent confrontation petered out when the Northern Resistance Movement march from the Falls through Belfast City Centre to the Crumlin gaol in support of the Hunger Strikers attracted only 800 and was stopped and dispersed by Security Forces without trouble 
were

in Northern Ireland of possible operational policies in Londonderry; and the meeting may wish to ask the Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and for Defence and the Chief of the General Staff what proposals are being evolved. 3. 
As regards the administration of justice the Attorney General’s 
memorandum (GEN 79(72) 8) is largely informative; and he does not ask his colleagues for any specific decisions. 
wish to discuss some of the following points which it raised in the context of the more conciliatory atmosphere which should prevail if the Secretary of State’s political initiative goes well:(a) The Criminal Law The Attorney General’s memorandum discloses a disturbing state of affairs. to:- 
(i) 
secure from the RUC the report of their investigation of the most recent allegations of ill-treatment. Why is this taking so long? 
(ii) 
ensure that instructions are issued to the RUC on the importance of distinguishing between the type of questioning appropriate to a prisoner against whom charges are likely to be brought in court and the type appropriate when the object is simply to secure intelligence. 
(The actual 
conduct of interrogation for intelligence purposes will be discussed later in the meeting.) 
We have also to decide whether, given the Attorney General’s judgment that some 30 pending prosecutions will have to be abandoned, the persons concerned should be re-arrested under the Special Powers Act (paragraph 4). Several of those whose arrests on 9th August, 1971, were judged invalid on purely technical grounds were immediately re-arrested under a valid formula. To re-arrest persons against whom prosecutions had been pending but had been dropped might, however, be open to wider criticism in so far as there was evidently no case to back up the suspicion upon which the individual had been arrested. On the other hand, what will be the reaction of "Loyalists" to the release of detainees on what will be said to be mere legal technicalities, comparable to those on which known terrorists have repeatedly been discharged in the Republic? 
Nevertheless, the meeting may In particular it is becoming increasingly urgent

(b) The Legal Position of the Security Forces The Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and for Defence might be asked whether they are content with the Attorney General’s proposals in paragraphs 10 and 11 that he should normally authorise prosecutions in cases involving physical assault or ill-treatment of persons in custody by members of the security forces but that he would regard as special cases reasonable actions to preserve law and order (for example, in particular cases, shooting to prevent the escape of a person whom soldiers are justified in attempting to arrest). The Attorney General might also be asked when he proposes to introduce the Order in Council permitting sittings of the Belfast Crown Court during August (paragraph 12). 
(c) 
Special Courts Do Ministers endorse the Attorney General’s clear conclusion in paragraph 18 that there is no advantage in courts with a special composition (without jurors) exercising the ordinary criminal law? Do they also endorse his implied preference (paragraph 21) for not instituting tribunals with special procedures going beyond the present criminal law and rules of evidence? The Attorney General presumably judges that, although such tribunals might be a more "judicial" alternative to the Secretary of State’s powers under the Special Powers Acts, their establishment would be seen as a further special measure indicating that the normal judicial structure of the Northern Ireland State was inadequate. 
(d) The Civil Law Do Ministers endorse the Attorney General’s view:(i) 
that, as regards the three (substantial) claims in respect of injuries suffered during deep interrogation, we should resist pressure for disclosure of documents about the instructions given and the techniques used (paragraph 23); 
(ii) 
that claims for death or injuries in the Londonderry incident should be dealt with in the light of the forthcoming opinion of the Law Officers upon the Crown’s legal liability; 
(iii) 
that claims for wrongful arrest or false imprisonment, where there is no question of brutality, should be settled;

(iv) 
that cases involving physical ill-treatment or brutality should be so disposed of as not to prejudice our position in contesting the admissibility of the Republic’s case at Strasbourg 
- as might happen if it could be represented that redress was not available in the domestic courts; (v) 
that there should not at present be any question of a statutory indemnity for members of the security forces. (This reflects the conclusions of a recent study by officials which is about to be circulated for consideration at a future meeting. A copy is attached. 
(e) The Strasbourg Cases Sub-paragraph 1 of paragraph 27 of the Attorney General’s memorandum further illustrates the inter-relationship between proceedings in domestic courts and the proceedings at Strasbourg. Ministers will clearly wish to endorse the Attorney General’s view that we should take every possible opportunity of delaying the Strasbourg hearings; he might be asked to report on the current position. 
4. As regards the Directive on Interrogation you asked that the Ministers 
concerned should specifically consider whether they regarded it as suitable for publication if, in extreme circumstances, we felt that we had no alternative but to publish it. 
In so far as considerations of security 
are involved, the JIG have reaffirmed their view that there would be no ultimate objection to publication; and Ministers have been so advised individually. To-morrow’s meeting will provide a convenient opportunity to check whether they endorse this view in political terms. If so, the new Directive should be issued without further delay; and in the case of Northern Ireland it should be accompanied, as the Attorney General has suggested, by a specific reminder about the domestic law on the subject in the Six Counties.

NORTHERN IRELAND: ACT OF INDEMNITY Note by Officials 
Precedents of Acts of Indemnity 1. 
The earlier precedents do not help since they relate to an obsolete 
method of dealing with disturbances, ie by an enactment suspending the application of the Habeas Corpus Acts to those suspected of treasonable practices (to allow arbitrary detention) followed at the expiry of the suspension by an Act or Indemnity for acts done under cover of the suspension. 
The modern practice is to take wide powers (as in the N I 
Special Powers Acts and Regulations) to enable the executive to detain and take other steps to restore order. 
As long as soldiers and officials 
act within such powers they require no indemnity because the jurisdiction of the courts is effectively excluded. 
The question of indemnity only 
arises when even the wide powers so conferred are exceeded, eg by the use of excessive force or failure to comply with legal requirements as to arrest. 
The only UK Acts of Indemnity enacted in recent times are the 
Indemnity Act 1920 and the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923. 
2. in Northern Ireland. 
The 1923 Act has only a superficial relevance to the present situation It did not deal with the "troubles" in Southern 
Ireland and, in particular, with the acts there of the military under General Macready which were the subject of much litigation in the Irish courts until operations ceased with the 1922 Treaty. 
was passed in relation to those operations. 3. 
No Act of Indemnity The 1923 Act had a strictly limited purpose. The Home Secretary 
(Mr Bridgeman) had continued, for a short period after Southern Ireland had become the Irish Free State, to issue orders under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations for the arrest of persons in England and their internment in Dublin (which involved their deportation). 
The 
Court of Appeal in the Art O’Brien case declared such orders invalid, and the Irish Free State Government acceded to the Home Secretary’s request to make O’Brien available for release in England. 
The objects of the 
1923 Act were to relieve the Home Secretary from possible liability for the (unpardonable) praemunire offences under the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 which he had arguably committed by sending British subjects in custody out of the country without powers, and to avoid the embarrassment of further applications in the English courts by those who had been the subject of

such orders and were still detained in Mountjoy prison. But the Act did 
not affect their right to challenge in the Irish courts the validity of the order of the appropriate Froe State Minister under which they were currently detained. 
4. The 1920 Act restricted the right to take legal proceedings in 
respect of acts done in good faith during the 1914-18 war in execution or purported execution of duty or for the defence of the realm or the public safety or otherwise in the public interest by a person holding office or employed under the Crown or any person acting under the authority of a person so holding office or employed. 
been done in good faith unless the contrary was proved. 
Irish case on an eighteenth century indemnity enactment that a good faith provision would allow proceedings for bodily maltreatment. 
The 1920 Act did not affect proceedings on behalf of the Crown, and so did not affect public prosecutions. 
A right to compensation assessed by a 
tribunal was given for some types of loss suffered by a person whose rights of action were restricted. 
There were a few similar local enactments following disturbances overseas in the 1920’s and the 1930’s, eg in Jamaica, Palestine and Cyprus. 
Timing and scope of Act of Indemnity 5. 
before order has been restored and all detainees released. 
There are obvious objections to the enactment of a general indemnity To legislate 
to prevent those still detained from taking proceedings to challenge any invalidity in an internment order would be to return in effect to the regime of arbitrary imprisonment without trial under cover of a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Acts. 
The draft Bill prepared for the last N I 
Government suffered from this vice since it would have prevented any proceedings, civil or criminal, in respect of anything purporting to have been done under Regulations 10 to 13 of the Special Powers Regulations or in carrying out any order made under then (thus covering internment and detention orders and interrogation). 
An act was to be deemed to have It seems from an

6. prosecutions. 
It is questionable too whether such an Let should bar public The 1920 Act excepted proceedings taken by the Crown. 
The 1923 Act did bar criminal proceedings, but this was essential to free the Home Secretary from any possible liability for the praemunire offence. The colonial precedents covered criminal proceedings, but were restricted to acts done in good faith. 
It would not be easy in those days to defend 
a provision which barred criminal proceedings for some gross form of violence in carrying into effect an order under the Special Powers Regulations. 
International aspects 7. An Act of Indemnity would be likely to have a serious effect on our prospects in the pending cases at Strasbourg. 
An indemnity which 
prevented those still detained from taking legal proceedings to challenge their detention would be a breach of Article 5 of the Convention and, unlike internment itself, could hardly be justified as a measure of derogation required by the exigencies of the emergency situation. Similarly, an Act barring the right to prosecute soldiers who had committed unlawful acts of shooting would probably be regarded as a breach of Article 2 which provides that everyone’s right to life is to be protected by law; and it might also give rise to new proceedings under Article 6 and Article 13. 
Moreover, any form of indemnity which appreciably 
abridged existing domestic remedies in respect of the breaches of the Convention alleged in the current complaints would undermine our case at the admissibility stage which is largely based on the existence and adequacy of those remedies, and might have an adverse effect at the merits stage. 
8. Even if the Strasbourg cases were disposed of by a finding that the 
United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under one or more of the Articles of the Convention, that would not strengthen the case for an Act of Indemnity in respect of the acts of the soldiers and officials concerned. Such an Act could not expunge our international breach, and any satisfaction that might fall to be made to an injured party in accordance with the Convention would be the responsibility of the Government and be made out of public funds.

Conclusion 9. 
These considerations suggest that an Indemnity Bill should not be 
introduced unless a pressing need arises on security or other policy grounds. 
allow those who wish to do so to pursue the normal remedies in the courts and for any damages and costs that may be payable by officials or soldiers to be met in appropriate cases out of public funds. 
In present circumstances the best course would seem to be to It is 
possible that the situation night change, eg anumber of private prosecutions night be commenced against soldiers which the Attorney General considered to be unjustified but which he did not think it proper to bring to an end by the exercise of his powers of entering a noble prosequi; or a situation night arise in which a spate of civil actions gave rise to serious problems in relation to the disclosure of the identity of those involved in security operations. 
If such a situation arose the natter would need to be reconsidered. An Act which went no 
further than to bar private prosecutions and transfer existing compensation jurisdiction from the courts to adinistrative tribunals for security reasons would probably not raise the sae problems, either in Parliament or at Strasbourg, that would be raised by abridging the existing remedies in the way proposed in the draft N I Bill which confined compensation to cases involving bodily injury. 
for any forn of indemnity provision. 
But no need seems to arise at present Unless we are confronted with a 
spate of private prosecutions or civil actions giving rise to security or other possible problems, it would be best to consider whether an Indemnity Act is appropriate when order has been restored, and the work of reconstruction and reconciliation has been started; that would be the most suitable time for the enactment of any Indemnity Act. 
In that 
situation there is a more persuasive case for a once for all enactment which will cover appropriate cases over the whole period of the emergency.

14th June 1972 In your letter of 6th June to Robert Andrew you mentioned 
the Prime Minister’s hope that action would be taken to refute press reports that a high proportion of those so far released from internment had returned to terrorist activity. 
When the Daily Express article to this effect appeared 
on 2nd June, we at once checked with Headquarters Northern Ireland exactly what was known on the point. The answer was that there were reports of varying reliability that up to 25 (of 380 or so who had been released by them) had returned to more or less active membership of the IRA - 
which did not 
necessarily mean that they had themselves become active terrorists again. This is obviously a very much smaller proportion than the one-quarter alleged by the Daily Express. 
HQNI confirmed 
that none of their officers had given any figures on the subject to the Express (which did not actually attribute this one-quarter theory to a military spokesman). 
You will be aware that Mr. Whitelaw made some references to 
this point in answering Questions on 8th June (Hansard, Cols. 678-9) and during the Debate on 12th June (Col. 1077). We consider that these references are a sufficient refutation of the press reports, and that any further more direct action might well be counter-productive. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt. Nevertheless, we shall use 
any opportunity which presents itself to correct the mistaken impression in these reports.

therofore he envisages parties represented in the prorogued Northern Ireland Parliament, or among Northern Ireland members at Westminster. This could admit Mr. Paisley, Mr. McManus and Miss Devlin, but not Vanguard or either wing of the IRA. 
The Secretary of State proposes 
consultation with the Northern Ireland political parties on whether non-political interests should also be represented. (b) What are the Secretary of State’s grounds for his confidence that 
the SDLP would agree to participate even though internment had not been ended? 
Is he equally confident that they would not insist either on some 
form of IRA participation, or on some kind of "amnesty" for persons guilty of "political" offences? What would we do if the SDLP (or anybody else) attempted to make such conditions? (c) How confident is the Secretary of State that the announcement of a conference would produce an end to violence, civil disobedience, and the "no-go" areas (his paragraph 5), given the apparent determination of the Provisional wing of the IRA to render Northern Ireland ungovernable? 
And 
can we be confident that the Official wing would maintain its "cease fire" if (as we surely must) we stood firm against IRA participation and any "amnesty" or termination of internment that was not warranted by the security situation? (d) How would the topics for discussion at the conference be defined (paragraph 4 of the Secretary of State’s paper)? 
He proposes to consult 
those who will participate in the conference on its precise terms of reference; 
but the Government’s undertaking to hold a plebiscite on the 
border presumably means that the conference would be directed towards seeking broad agreement upon the type of Government appropriate to Northern Ireland unless and until the majority of its people choose that it should no longer be part of the United Kingdom. (e) What kinds of "neutral" person has the Secretary of State in mind as Chairmen of the conference? 
The name of Sir Patrick Macrory comes at once to mind. Does the Secretary of State intend to discuss this also with the

TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELNO 181 OF 29/7 INFO UKREP BELFAST. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF MESSAGE FROM PRIME MINISTER TO MR LYNCH. I SHOULD LIKE TO SEND YOU THIS PERSONAL MESSAGE AT WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE SOMETHING OF A TURNING POINT IN THE AFFAIRS OF NORTHERN IRELAND SINCE HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT TOOK OVER FULL RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND IN MARCH, WE HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT IN OUR POWER TO END VIOLENCE TO ENCOURAGE ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY TO TAKE PART IN THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE PROVINCE, AND TO WORK FOR RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THEM. AS YOU KNOW, MR WHITELAW HAS MADE A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBERS OF THOSE INTERNED: HE IS PLANNING FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS LATER THIS YEAR IN WHICH PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION IS TO BE REINTRODUCED: 
AND HE HAS 
INVITED VIEWS ON POLITICALSOLUTIONS FROM ALL QUARTERS WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING A CONFERENCE IN THE AUTUMN. AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTIVITY OF THE SECURITY FORCES HAS BEEN KEPT TO A LOW LEVEL EVEN AT THE RISK OF MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE PART OF THE PROTESTANTS. IN SHORT, EVERYTHING POSSIBLE HAS BEEN DONE TO SET THE AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE ON A NEW COURSE. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN THWARTED BY THE ACTIONS 
OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA. DESPITE THE BRIEF CEASEFIRE, THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, THAT THEY HAVE THE DELIBERATE AIM OF PREVETING RECONCiLIATION AND THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO USE EVERY METHOD OF INTIMIDATION TO DETER THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY FROM JOINING IN THE SEARCH FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS. IN DOING SO, THEY HAVE INEVITABLY PROVOKED EXTREMISTS AMONG THE PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO THE IRA CHALLENGE BY A MEASURE OF VIOLENCE AND BY SETTING UP THEIR OWN BARRICADES. THIS HAS PRODUCED A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN WHICH VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING, AND LAW AND ORDER PROGRESSIVELY BREAKING DOWN. MOREVER, THE PROVISIONALS SHOWED BY THEIR CAREFULLY PLANNED AND CONCERTED CAMPAIGN OF EXPLOSIONS IN BELFAST ON FRIDAY, 21 JULY A CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE LIVES

DRAFT MESSAGE FROM PRIME MINISTER TO MR. LYNCH something of a turning point i 
the affairs of Northern Ireland. 2. Since Her Majesty’s Government took over full 
responsibility for the government of Northern Ireland in March, we have made every effort in our power to end violence, to encourage all sections of the community to take part in the search for a political solution to the problems of the Province, and to work for reconciliation between them. As you know, Mr. Whitelaw has made a substantial reduction in the numbers of those interned; 
is planning for local elections later this year in which proportional representation is to be reintroduced; and has invited 
views on political solutions from 
all quarters with the aim of holding a conference in the autumn. 
t the same time the activity of the 
Security Forces was kept to a low level even at the risk of much misunderstanding on the part of the Protestants. In short everything possible has been done to set the affairs of the Province on a new course. 3. 
Unfortunately, our efforts have been 
thwarted by the actions of the Provisional IRA. Despite the brief 
ceasefire, they have 
shown that they are determined to continue their campaign of violence, that they have the deliberate aim of preventing reconciliation and that they are prepared to use every method of intimidation to deter the Roman Catholic community from joining in the searc h for political solutions. In doing so, they have inevitably provoked the activity of extremists among the Protestants who have responded

27 July 1972 
The Rt Hon Sir Burke Trend GCB CVO Cabinet Office 70 Whitehall London S W 1 
At the end of this morning’s meeting of GEN 79 my Secretary of State made a plea for a study of some new arrangements which would enable the Government to avoid the great embarrassment of being forced back on to the Faulkner Government’s policy of search, arrest, interrogation and internment. 
I do not know 
how this will be followed up in the GEN 79 minutes, but you may like to have the attached document which sets out new possibilities. 
The basic problem is very simple. There are about 
100 terrorists against whom we could at once prefer legal charges if they were arrested, with a very good prospect of getting convictions against them by the ordinary processes of the law. 
There are about 
another 120 terrorists against whom we do not have sufficient evidence to prefer a charge, but might be chargeable if after arrest they were the subject of a reasonably short and entirely lawful interrogation. Third, there are about 80 terrorists, including most of the key ones, against whom we are not in a position to prefer charges of the normal sort partly because they do not themselves indulge over much in specific acts of terrorism, but rather organise them: partly because it is extremely difficult to get any evidence against them which will stand up in a court of law: and partly because the witnesses we might bring against them would all be in danger of their lives. 
In sum, we are in the position under the existing law and powers whereby we cannot deal with the key terrorists, even after we have caught them, other than by internment. 
And this, as you know, is a poison which might kill all further political initiatives.

It was with this in mind that I thought up the idea of proscription for terrorists. Since then Neil Cairncross and Sir Kenneth Jones have greatly improved on this idea and indeed transformed it into respectability. 
its latest form. 
The attached document records Unless this or some other more 
acceptable but equally effective device can be found, I am bound to say that I see no way of avoiding the problem of internment, and I am bound to add that our efforts to apprehend the terrorists will remain handicapped as they are now. 
I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Robert Armstrong, and to my Secretary of State. 
WILLIAM NIELD 
P.S. The following have copies of this document, of course without commitment to them: my Secretary of State, Secretary of State for Defence, the Attorney General, of course myself, Mr Cairncross and Sir Kenneth Jones.

Preventive Detention for Terrorist Conduct The capacity of the Provisional IRA (or of any other 
terrorist orgaisation) to engage in terrorism will not be effectively destroyed until all its important members are removed. It will be possible to charge some with criminal offences under the ordinary law; but others and perhaps the most important of them are beyond the reach of the criminal law partly because witnesses cannot be expected to come forward to give oral evidence in the ordinary way, and partly because the evidence available to connect accused persons with specific offences as opposed to general complicity in terrorism is sometimes tenuous,particularly in the case of the most important provisional IRA leaders. Any action we take must be such as not to alienate the minority community as a whole: a consideration which must rule out the further use of internment in the arbitrary form which it now takes under the Special Powers Act. 
The most promising possibility is to create a system 
of special courts whose function would not be to convict accused persons of criminal offences, but to judge whether they were guilty of certain specified conduct and commit them to "preventive detention" if they were. The Act making this provision (as to the necessity of an Act see below) could be of 6 months duration renewable by Order in Council. The provision would apply to conduct involving complicity in any degree with terrorism generally; it

one of conviction for a crime so as to remove the taint of internment. But the nature of the proceedings and in particular the fact that a course of conduct rather than a specific act is involved and that the accused could not be confronted with his accuser, really remove any credibility from the idea that what is involved is conviction for a crime; and we would be accused of degrading the criminal law. Moreover if special courts were to deal with crimes committed before the passing of the legislation, we should be in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights. But preventive detention is quite far removed from the present concept of internment. Naturally anyone who could be brought before a criminal court would be and it could be provided that acquittal in a criminal court was no bar to proceedings for preventive detention. It might be possible to bring all persons interned under the present procedure before the special court for discharge or committal to preventive detention. 
It must be regarded as doubtful whether provision of the 
kind described could properly be made under either the Special Powers Act or the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972. Apart from the political consideration that it involve a new departure for which the United Kingdom Parliament might demand a Bill from the legal point of view the new law would contain provisions making it extremely doubtful whether they are within the powers of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and hence of an Order in Council under

would not deal with matters that are already covered by the criminal law. Any person would be allowed to effect an arrest without warrant if there was reasonable suspicion complicity in the conduct referred to; and any list of suspects published by the authority of the Chief Constable or an Assistant Chief Constable of the RUC would be conclusive evidence that there was reasonable suspicion. An arrested person could be held for 72 hours for questioning; and then either discharged or brought before a magistrate to be committed to a special court. A special court would consist of a judge of the Supreme Court sitting with any other judge of the Supreme Court or a county court judge or a resident magistrate. There would be no jury, no preliminary hearing of evidence by an examining magistrate and the proceedings would be in camera. The ordinary laws of evidence would not apply; the court would simply be enjoined to have regard to the probative value of evidence laid before them. The court would be obliged to inform the accused at least of the general tenor of the evidence against him and to hear him or his counsel in his defence. If the court found the case proved, it would commit the accused to preventive detention, and there would be provision for release by the Secretary of State on conditional licence. The duration of the detention would also be affected by the duration of the Act itself. There would be a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland sitting in camera. 
It might be argued that if special courts can be instituted in the manner described, the concept should be

7. Other points upon which Ministers may wish to be satisfied before 
making a decision are:(a) The risk of heavy "civilian" casualties, which we were formerly advised would be inseparable from an operation to reoccupy the Bogside and Creggan. 
(b) The use of armoured vehicles. I understand that it is proposed 
to use wheeled, not tracked, armoured personnel carriers; but that the AVRE (converted tanks) cannot be landed on the west bank of the Foyle and must be driven up from Magilligan and across the Craigavon Bridge 
- with a good deal of publicity as a result. 
(c) The use of heavy weapons. I understand that the Secretary of State for Defence envisages that Company Commanders should be authorised to use Carl Gustav rocket launchers (such as have been used to detonate bombs in cars) against premises from which heavy firing is being directed against the security forces. This may entail substantial casualties? 
8. Paragraph 3 of the memorandum emphasises the importance of 
reintroducing "searches, arrests, interrogation and some method of keeping suspects in custody if there is insufficient evidence to convict them in a court". This raises additional questions, of a rather different kind:(d) The scale of interrogation and the willingness of the RUC Special Branch to conduct it. They have recently become unco-operative in this respect; but the Attorney General hopes that the Special Branch will accept his assurances that, provided that they adhere to lawful methods of interrogation, they will have nothing to fear. 
(e) The responsibility for operational control of the RUC and Special Branch in relation to security operations. This question was raised at the last meeting of GEN 79, when the Secretary of State for Defence advocated that the responsibility should be transferred to the GOC and the Director of Intelligence but the Secretary of State was strongly opposed to this course on grounds of RUC morale. 
(f) Internment or detention. I understand that the Secretary of State 
remains unwilling to reintroduce internment but may be prepared to make detention orders for periods of up to 28 days on a fairly wide scale; and the Attorney General may say that the existing provisions of the Special Powers Acts suffice to make this legal, provided that interrogation is continued throughout this period.

IT COULD PRODUCE A CLIMATE WHERE WE LIVED TOGETHER. THE TAOISEACH DECLINED TO SUGGEST A TIME-TABLE. THERE WAS NO POINT, ME THOUGHT, IN SETTING FIVE, SEVEN OR 10 OR 20 YEARS. IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME FOR WOUNDS TO HEAL AND FOR MISUNDERSTANDINGS TO BE FORGOTTEN. HE HOPED THAT IRA ACTION ON FRIDAY WOULD NOT PROVOKE THE BRITISH ARMY. NEITHER SIDE COULD WIN BY TAKING REPRESSIVE ACTION AND HE HOPED THAT SENSE WOULD PREVAIL. HE HOPED ALSO THAT BRITISH ARMY SEARCHES WERE NOT ON SUCH A SCALE AS TO PROVOKE REACTION. HE DID NOT WISH TO COMMENT ON THE BRITISH ARMY’S ACTIONS AS HE DID NOT KNOW HOW THEY WOULD GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS, BUT VIOLENCE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WOULD PROVOKE VIOLENCE. WHEN INTERNMENT WAS INTRODUCED HE HAD URGED THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AGAINST IT BECAUSE IT WOULD ONLY PROVOKE A GREAT DEAL OF BITTERNESS. FOR EVERY MAN INTERNED ONE, TwO OR 10 MEN WOULD BE INVEIGLED INTO THE IRA. THE SAME THING WAS TRUE NOW. HOWEVER IT WAS NOT HIS PROBLEM. HE HAD NOT TO MAKE THE DECISION, AND HE COULD UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY AND THE TEMPTATION. HE ONLY HOPED THE REINTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY

Note of a meeting at noon on 25 August 
OPERATIONS There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate 
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces. Since Operation Motorman fourteen members of the security forces have been killed and fifty-six wounded. 
ARREST AND INTERROGATION POLICIES 2. 
The meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against 
the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given rise to press enquiries. Possible changes in the law or legal procedure are being considered by an inter-departmental group. In considering in due course whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving theirobjectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since Operation Motorman and what has happened to them. It will then be possible to form a view as to the reasons why the hard-core of the Provisionals appears not yet to have been brought into custody. The Ministry of Defence will try to prepare this analysis and make it available to the GOC, with whom there will probably be discussions in Northern Ireland next week. INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
Questions about the Government’s plans for dealing with the level of 
military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the news, and are difficult to handle. There would be great dangers, however, in trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced to reduce their campaign against civilians. LEGAL MATTERS 4. 
It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought 
of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers Act. When there is evidence, arrests can therefore be made with a view to charges being brought. The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office will ensure that this is understood by the Army and the RUC respectively. NEXT MEETING 5. 
There will be no meeting on Tuesday, 29 August. The meeting at noon on Friday, 1 September, will be in Conference Room ’B’.

21 August 1972 ESCAPE TUNNEL AT LONG KESH 
You wrote to me on 15 August saying that the Prime Minister wondered how it was possible for the would be escapers to tunnel so far without being discovered; and that he considered that more effective precautions against possible escape should be put in hand at once. 
Enclosed is a report from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland which fully covers both points. It shows that the prospects of anyone being able to escape through the tunnel were in fact very slim indeed. None the less further precautions, which we hope the Prime Minister will agree are adequate, have been taken.

ATTEMPTED TUNNEL ESCAPE FROM LONG KESH INTERNMENT CENTRE 
On Sunday evening 13 August 1972 a Prison Officer on duty at Long Kesh noticed some subsidence of the ground just outside the perimeter of Compound 5 but inside the perimeter of the Centre itself. 
Investigation by Prison Officers and the Army led to the discovery of a tunnel some 60 feet long starting in Compound 5 under the floor of Nissen Hut 26 which is used partly as sleeping accommodation and partly for hobbies, recreation, etc. The tunnel had caved in some 20 feet from the perimeter fence of the Centre. 
A head count of the compound showed that the numbers of internees were correct and a thorough search was made of the compound and the internees housed therein. This showed that a considerable quantity of soil had been stored in the internees clothes lockers in Hut 26 and indeed in lockers in some of the other huts in Compound 5. 
Long Kesh Internment Centre is sited within the perimeter of an Army camp and security is a joint responsibility of the Prison Service and the Army. 
Security within the Centre.is provided by prison officers who guard the perimeter of each compound and the entrance to the whole Centre. Prison officers in pairs patrol within each compound but do not normally enter the huts. Occasional searches are made of the huts but only when it is suspected that something untoward is going on. Any search is made in some strength and with Army support. 
The circumstances in which men are held at Long Kesh mean that some attempts at escape are inevitable. The men are held in compounds of about 60 men each (at the peak period there have been 86 men in each compound) and are able freely to mix within the compound. Each compound comprises four nissen huts of which one is for messing, two for sleeping accommodation and one is half sleeping accommodation and half for recreation. There are other buildings for ablutions and study. At night the men are locked in their sleeping quarters but it would not be impossible by any means for them to break out of their particular hutments.

Because of the nature of this establishment and its inmates normal prison discipline cannot be applied. Internees cannot he required to work and they are generally uncooperative and at times aggressive. There are no separate cells and in the political circumstnces which exist in Northern Ireland no sanctions which can be applied for breaches of discipline. 
Since this Internment Centre was opened in September 1971 one man only has escaped and he bluffed his way out through the main gates disguised as one of a number of Roman Catholic priests who were in the Centre at the time to say Mass. 
There have been a number of attempts at escape of which this latest is probably the most serious. The chances of this latest effort succeeding were not really great. The high water level in the area means that a tunnel of any real depth will flood and a shallow tunnel, such as this was, is very likely to cave in as in fact happened in this case. Furthermore the internees had tunnelled not much more than half way to the perimeter fence of the Internment Centre and were having to go outside Hut 26 to dispose of the excavated soil. 
Had the internees managed to tunnel under the perimeter fence of the Internment Centre itself they would still have had to overcome a number of obstacles to escape. The area outside that fence is flood lit and clearly visible to Army personnel posted in observation towers along the perimeter fence. There are also dog patrols in this area and concealed trip wires designed to set off alarms. Any escapes would also have to get through the perimeter fence surrounding the Army camp. 
STEPS TAKEN OR BEING TAKEN TO PRESENT A RECURRENCE 
(a) All hand tools available to the internees for hobbies have been withdrawn. As the International Red Cross have already commented adversely on the psychological effects of boredom, etc, on internees, it is proposed to permit the use of a limited range of hand tools for hobbies but to do so on the basis of a daily issue which must be handed back each evening.

(b) It is proposed to have regular fortnightly searches by Prison Officers supplemented by major Army searches each month. 
(c) The existing vehicle trench around the Centre is to be supplemented by trenches dug across each concreted area. These will be filled with water and should provide a defence against any tunnel which might not otherwise be detected. In this particular case the concreted and tarmac area provided stability for the roof of the tunnel.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND I have a naging feeling that the Regular I.R.A., 
who have maintained their truce despite the provocations of the Provisionals but who have also been reinforced by the release of all their members from internment, may possibly be preparing to intervene again, fully organised, at a later stage should the opportunity offer itself. How good is our intelligence about the members 
of the Regulars, what they are up to, and what their intentions are? And have we got any particular plans to cope with 
such an eventuality?

TO PRIME MINISTER FROM DUTY CLERK YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO SEE A COPY OF A TELEGRAM FROM 
WASHINGTON WHICH HAS JUST ARRIVED ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND: ON 9 AUGUST SENATOR KENNEDY MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT 
IN THE US SENATE. 
QUOTE MR PRESIDENT TODAY THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, CAUGHT AMID THE NEW BLOODSHED AND DESTRUCTION THAT HAVE SHOCKED THE WORLD IN RECENT WEEKS, MARK THE UNHAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF GREAT BRITAIN’S CRUEL AND REPRESSIVE POLICY OF INTERNMENT. 
PERHAPS THERE IS NO STEP THAT CAN BE TAKEN NOW IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT IS CAPABLE OF STEMMING THE FEROCIOUS TIDE OF 
VIOLENCE THREATENING TO CONSUME THE PEOPLE OF ULSTER, PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC ALIKE. 
BUT I BELIEVE THAT AN END OF 
THE UNCONSCIONABLE POLICY OF INTERNMENT MUST RANK AT THE TOP OF THE LIST OF AVAILABLE STEPS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE TAKEN IF THERE IS TO BE ANY HOPE AT ALL OF BRINGING AN EARLY AND PEACEFUL END TO THE KILLING AND VIOLENCE. 
NO NATION THAT 
CALLS ITSELF A DEMOCRACY CAN JUSTIFY A POLICY OF INTERNMENT FOR ITS CITIZENS. 
IN THE CASE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, THE SHAME OF INTERNMENT HAS BEEN TWICE COMPOUNDED - FIRST BY THE 
EVIDENCE OF TORTURE IN THE INTERNMENT CAMPS, THE FACTS OF WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED BEYOND DISPUTE IN THE RECENT COMPTON REPORT: AND SECOND, BY THE INCREDIBLY UNFAIR MANNER IN WHICH INTERNMENT HAS BEEN APPLIED 
- QUOTE FOR CATHOLICS ONLY UNQUOTE HAS BEEN 
BRITAIN’S INTERNMENT POLICY, AND IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE. 
WHAT ABOUT THE UDA? WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTANT GUNMEN? WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTANT ASSASSINATION SQUADS WHO HAVE BEEN SO ACTIVE IN RECENT WEEKS? I HOLD NO BRIEF FOR THE IRA, OR FOR THE VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION SO WANTONLY INFLICTED BY MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC MINORITY IN ULSTER. BUT SURELY, BRITISH JUSTICE IS 
A FARCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND TODAY, WHEN ONLY CATHOLICS ARE INTERNED AND PROTESTANT GUNMEN ROAM FREE. 
TODAY, WHEN PASSIONS IN ALL THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN ULSTER ARE RISING HIGH AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE BRITISH INVASION OF THE QUOTE NO-GO UNQUOTE AREAS AND THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF CATHOLIC DISTRICTS, AND WHEN THE OBVIOUS ABSENCE OF COMPARABLE STEPS AGAINST PROTESTANT VIOLENCE IS MAKING A MOCKERY OF BRITAIN’S CLAIM TO EVENHANDEDJUSTICE, IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE OF INTERNMENT. 
ND SO ON THIS TRAGIC FIRST ANNIVERSARY, I RENEW THE APPEAL HAVE MADE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST, I URGE PRIME MINISTER HEATH 
ND SECRETARY WHITELAW TO ACT NOW TO END INTERNMENT, AND TO RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF JUSTICE AND DECENCY AND FAIRNESS FOR WHICH BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN RENOWNED.

2. AT THE LONDUNDERRY TALKS WITH ME ON 3 AUGUST (MY 
TEL 025 TO NIO), A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED, BUT THE MAIN TOPIC WAS TALKS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. I AGAIN AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD SEIZE THE POLITICAL OPENINGS PROVIDED BY OPERATION MOTORMAN AND THAT AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, THEY SHOULD TALK DIRECT WITH MR WHITELAW INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO USE HIS OFFICIALS SUCH AS MYSELF AS INTERMEDIARIES. 
THE SDLP SAID THAT THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO 
MEET HIM, THEY WOULD NOT DO SO UNLESS THEY FIRST HAD A FIRM GUARANTEE THAT INTERNMENT WOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MEETING. 
THEY ARGUED THAT QUITE APART FROM THE INTRINSIC 
MERITS OF THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT, THEY WOULD BE DESTROYED AS A POLITICAL PARTY IF THEY LEFT TALKS WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT IT. 
I SAID I WAS SURE HE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SUCH GUARANTEE. I LATER TELEPHONED HIM TO CONFIRM THIS. 
3. THE SDLP THEN ASKED FOR A FURTHER MEETING WITH ME ( ON MONDAY 7 AUGUST). 
THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MEETING. THE 
SDLP ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICAL FINISH FOR THEM AND A VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO ADVOCATED VIOLENCE AS A MEANS OF GETTING RESULTS, IF THEY LEFT A MEETING WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT SOMETHING REALLY BIG TO SHOW FOR THEIR EFFORTS. 
I TRIED TO 
PERSUADE THEM THAT IT WOULD NOT, AND SAID THAT THOUGHT THE SECRTARY OF STATE HAD AUTHORISED ME TO SAY THAT HE WANTED TO HELP THEM IN THEIR DIFFICULT POSITION, HE COULD NOT GIVE THEM GUARANTEES. 
LATER THE SDLP AGREED TO MEET MR WHITELAW. 
4. THE SDLP HAD MEETINGS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON 7 AND 8 AUGUST. YOU MAY WISH TO SEND TO FCO AND DUBLIN A COPY OF THE RECORD OF THESE TALKS PREPARED BY MR PLATT (AND DAT A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS WAS DISCUSSED BUT AGAIN THE 
9. AUGUST). MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT.

5. THE ’IRISH TIMES’ ARTICLE REFERRED TO IN DUBLIN TEL 562 A FAIRLY ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THE CASE PUT FORWARD BY THE THEY ARGUED THAT INTERNMENT INTRODUCED BY THE 
FAULKNER GOVERNMENT AND APPLIED ONLY AGAINST CATHOLICS WAS A VERY EMOTIVE ISSUE FOR CATHOLICS AS A WHOLE, THAT CATHOLIC EXTREMISTS WOULD EXPLOIT IT TO TURN THE CATHOLICS AGAIN AGAINST THE ARMY, AND THAT UNTIL IT WAS ENDED A SECURITY SITUATION COULD NOT BE ADMIRED WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ARMY FORCE LEVELS TO BE REDUCED TO NORMAL. 
THEY AGREED 
THAT EVEN IF IT WAS ENDED, CATHOLIC EXTREMISTS WOULD FIND SOME OTHER ISSUE TO EXPLOIT: BUT THEY CONTENDED THAT NO OTHER ISSUE WOULD ATTRACT SUCH SYMPATHY OR BE AS EFFECTIVE AS THAT OF INTERNMENT. 
QUICKLY, IT WOULD BE SEEN TO HAVE BEEN ENDED BECAUSE OF THE MERITS OF THE CASE FOR ENDING IT AND AS A RESULT OF REPRESENTATIONS BY POLITICIANS: BUT IF IT WAS ENDED LATER, VIOLENCE AND COUNTER-VIOLENCE WOULD MEANWHILE HAVE GROWN AGAIN AND INTERNMENT WOULD APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN ENDED IN RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE: THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF THOSE SUCH AS THE IRA WHO SAID THAT THE BRITISH RESPONDED ONLY TO VIOLENCE. 
6. MR WHITELAW REITERATED THAT IT WAS HMG’S POLICY TO END INTERNMENT AS SOON AS THE SECURITY SITUATION ALTERED, AND HE EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTIES IN THIS (APART OF COURSE FROM THAT OF THE MORALE OF PART OF THE SECURITY FORCES). 
HE WOULD DISCUSS THE POINTS PUT FORWARD BY THE SDLP WITH THE PRIME MINISTER. 
IT WAS AGREED THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER MEETING WITH THE SDLP YESTERDAY 11AUGUST. THEY FURTHER ARGUED THAT IF INTERNMENT WERE ENDED HE SAID THAT

7. AT YESTERDAY’S MEETING, THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THAT 
THERE WAS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HMG AND THE SDLP ON THE NDING OF INTERNMENT AS AN OBJECTIVE: THE DIFFERENCE WAS ON 
TIMING, AND, FOR THE REASONS GIVEN BY HIM AT THE PREVIOUS MEETING, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE EITHER TO END INTERNMENT IMMEDIATELY OR TO GIVE ANY GUARANTEE ABOUT A DATE FOR ITS ENDING, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS KEPT UNDER REVIEW. 
HE TOLD THE SDLP 
THAT INVITATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES WITH ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE TO THE STORMONT HOUSE OF COMMONS WERE NOW BEING ISSUED TO AN ALL NORTHERN IRELAND PARTY CONFERENCE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. 
8. THE SDLP EXPRESSED GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AT THIS STATEMENT ON INTERNMENT. 
THEY REPEATED THEIR ARGUMENTS FOR ENDING IT, 
SPEAKING MORE COGENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND WITH LESS POLEMICS THAN AT THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS. 
UNLESS INTERNMENT WAS ENDED QUICKLY, THE PRESENT SITUATION WITH ITS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR A PEACEFUL FUTURE WOULD RAPIDLY DETERIORATE INTO VIOLENCE. 
THEIR BASIC THEME WAS AGAIN THAT SO FAR AS THE SDLP WERE CONCERNED, 
THEY WOULD NOT ATTEND THE ALL PARTY CONFERENCE UNTIL INTERNMENT ENDED ( ONE REASON WAS THATWERE THEY TO DO SO, THEY WOULD LOSE ALL THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE CATHOLICS). 
9. THE SDLP SAID THEY WERE NOW FACED WITH A DECISION: EITHER THEY COULD ATTACK MR WHITELAW, HMG AND THE SECURITY FORCES OR SOME MEANS MUST BE FOUND TO SUSTAIN THE FEELING OF HOPE ENGENDERED AMONGST CATHOLICS BY THEIR TALKS WITH MR WHITELAW. THEY FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT MR WHITELAW AND HMG’S POLICIES WERE THE ONLY HOPE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND: THEY HAD, THEY CLAIMED, CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED HIM, AND WANTED TO CONTINUE TO DO SO: AND SOME CREDIBLE MEANS MUST THEREFORE BE DEVISED FOR CONTINUING THE TALKS. 
AFTER SOME DISCUSSION, THE SECRETARY 
F STATE SAID THAT TO KEEP THESE TALKS GOING, HE WOULD LOOK INTO HE POSSIBILITY OF ARRANGING A MEETING BETWEEN THE SDLP AND THE PRIME MINISTER, PERHAPS ABOUT THE END OF AUGUST.

THE SDLP OF COURSE RAISED MANY OTHER POINTS AT THESE 
TING INCLUDING LICENSED FIREARMS, ARMY OCCUPATION OF SCHOOLS, EGED IMPARTIAL BEHAVIOUR BY THE SECURITY FORCES, THE UDR, 
POLICY TOWARDS THE UDA, AND THE LEGALISATION OF THE REPUBLICAN CLUBS AND SINN FEIN. 
MR WHITELAW GAVE REPLIES ON 
ALL THESE POINTS WHICH THE SDLP APPARENTLY FOUND ACCEPTABLE, EVEN WHEN THEY DISAGREED E.G. WITH THE POLICY ON LICENSED FIREARMS. 
ALTHOUGH THE SDLP WERE OBVIOUSLY GENUINELY CONCERNED 
BOTH FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND THEIR OWN POSITION IN PARTICULAR AT THE RESPONSE ON INTERNMENT, WE GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE NOT TOO DISSATISFIED WITH THIS SERIES OF MEETINGS. AND AS YOU WILL HAVE SEEN FROM THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENT, THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO GAIN ADVANTAGE FROM THE MEETINGS BOTH FOR THEIR OWN POSITIONS AND FOR THEIR LINE THAT TALK IS A BETTER POLICY FOR THE CATHOLIC MINORITY THAN VIOLENCE.

THAT QUITE APART FROM THE INTRINSIC MERITS OF THE ENDING OF INTERNET, THEY WOULD BE DESTROYED AS A POLITICAL PARTY 
IF THEY LEFT TALKS WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT IT. SURE HE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SUCH GUARANTEE. HIM TO CONFIRM THIS. 
I SAID I WAS I LATER TELEPHONED 
3. THE SDLP THEN ASKED FOR A FUTHER MEETING WITH ME (ON MONDAY 7 AUG). THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MEETING. THE SDLP ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICAL FINISH FOR THEM AND A VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO ADVOCATED VIOLENCE AS A MEANS OF GETTING RESULTS, IF THEY LEFT A MEETING WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT SOMETHING REALLY BIG TO SHOW FOR THEIR EFFORTS. I TRIED To PERSUADE THE THAT IT WOULD NOT, AND SAID THAT THOUGH THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAD AUTHORIZED ME TO SAY THAT HE WANTED TO HELP THEM IN THEIR DIFFICULT POSITION, HE COULD NOT GIVE THEM GUARANTEES. LATER THE SDLP AGREED TO MEET MR WHITELAW. 
4. THE SDLP HAD MEETINGS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON 7 AND 8 AUG. YOU MAY WISH TO SEND TO FCO AND DUBLIN A COPY OF THE RECORD OF THESE TALKS PREPARED BY MR PLATT(AND DATED 9 AUG). A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS WAS DISCUSSED BUT AGAIN THE MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT. 
5. THE ’’IRISH TIMES’’ ARTICLE REFERRED TO IN DUBLIN TEL 562 GIVES A FAIRLY ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THE CASE PUT FORWARD BY THE SDLP. THEY ARGUED THAT INTERNMENT INTRODUCED BY THE FAULKNER GOVERNMENT AND APPLIED ONLY AGAINST CATHOLICS 
INTERNMENT AS SOON AS THE SECURITY. SITUATION ALTERED, AND HE EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTIES IN THIS (APART OF COURSE FROM THAT OF THE MORALE OF PART OF THE SECURITY FORCES). HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DISCUSS THE POINTS PUT FORWARD BY THE SDLP WITH THE PRIME MINISTER. IT WAS AGREED THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER MEETING WITH THE SDLP YESTERDAY 11 AUG. 
7. AT YESTERDAY’S MEETING, THE SECRETARY Of STATE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HMG AND THE SDLP ON THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT AS AN OBJECTIVE: THE DIFFERENCE WAS ON TIMING, AND, FOR THE REASONS GIVEN BY HIM AT THE PREVIOUS MEETING, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE EITHER TO END INTERNMENT IMMEDIATELY OR TO GIVE ANY GUARANTEE ABOUT A DATE FOR ITS ENDING, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS KEPT UNDER REVIEW. HE TOLD THE SDLP THAT INVITATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES WITH ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE TO THE STORMONT HOUSE OF COMMONS WERE NOW BEING ISSUED TO AN ALL NORTHERN IRELAND PARTY CONFERENCE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. 
- WAS 
A VERY EMOTIVE ISSUE FOR CATHOLICS AS A WHOLE, THAT CATHOLIC EXTREMISTS WOULD EXPLOIT IT TO TURN THE CATHOLICS AGAIN AGAINST ThE ARMY, AND THAT UNTIL IT WAS ENDED A SECURITY SITUATION COULD NOT BE ADMIRED WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ARMY FORCE LEVELS TO BE REDUCED TO NORMAL. THE AGREED THAT EVEN IF IT WAS ENDED, CATHOLIC EXTREMISTS WOULD FIND SOME OTHER ISSUE TO EXPLOIT: BUT THEY CONTENDED THAT NO OTHER ISSUE WOULD ATTRACT SUCH SYMPATHY OR BE AS ECCECTIVE AS THAT OF INTERNMENT. THEY FURTHER ARGUED THAT IF INTERNMENT WERE ENDED QUICKLY, IT WOULD BE SEEN TO HAVE BEEN ENDED BECAUSE OF THE MERITS OF THE CASE FOR ENDING IT AND AS A RESULT OF REPRESENTATIONS BY POLITICIANS: BUT IF IT WAS ENDED LATER, VIOLENCE AND COUNTERVIOLENCE WOULD MEANWHILE HAVE GROWN AGAIN AND INTERNMENT WOULD APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN ENDED IN RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE: THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF THOSE SUCH AS THE IRA WHO SAID THAT THE BRITISH RESPONDED ONLY TO VIOLENCE. 
WHAT IT WAS HBC’S POLICY TO END SECURITY SITUATION ALTERED AND 
8. THE SDLP EXPRESSED GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AT THIS STATEmENT ON INTERNMENT. THEY REPEATED THEIR ARGUEMENTS FOR ENDING IT, SPEAKING MORE COGETLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND WITH LESS POLEMICS THAT AT THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS. THEIR BASIC THEME WAS AGAIN THAT UNLESS INTERNMENT WAS ENDED QUICKLY, THE PRESENT SITUATION WITH ITS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR A PEACEFUL FUTURE WOULD RAPIDLY DETERIORIATE INTO VIOLENCE.

ON 9 AUGUST SENATOR KENNEDY MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IN THE US SENATE. QUOTE MR PRESIDENT, TODAY THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, CAUGHT AMID THE NEW BLOODSHED AND DESTRUCTION THAT HAVE SHOCKED THE WORLD IN RECENT WEEKS, MARK THE UNHAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF GREAT BRITAIN’S CRUEL AND REPRESSIVE POLICY OF INTERNMENT. PERHAPS THERE IS NO STEP THAT CAN BE TAKEN NOW IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT IS CAPABLE OF STEMMING THE FEROCIOUS TIDE OF VIOLENCE THREATENING TO CONSUME THE PEOPLE OF ULSTER, PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC ALIKE.

BRITAIN’S INTERNMENT POLICY, AND IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE. WHAT ABOUT THE UDA? WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTANT GUNMEN? WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTANT ASSASSINATION SQUADS WHO HAVE BEEN SO ACTIVE IN RECENT WEEKS? I HOLD NO BRIEF FOR THE IRA, OR FOR THE VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION SO WANTONLY INFLICTED BY MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC MINORITY IN ULSTER. BUT SURELY, BRITISH JUSTICE IS A FARCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND TODAY, WHEN ONLY CATHOLICS ARE INTERNED AND PROTESTANT GUNMEN ROAM FREE. TODAY, WHEN PASSIONS IN ALL THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN ULSTER ARE RISING HIGH AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE BRITISH INVASION OF THE QUOTE NO-GO UNQUOTE AREAS AND THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF CATHOLIC DISTRICTS, AND WHEN THE OBVIOUS ABSENCE OF COMPARABLE STEPS AGAINST PROTESTANT VIOLENCE IS MAKING A MOCKERY OF BRITAIN’S CLAIM TO EVENHANDED JUSTICE, IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE OF INTERNMENT. AND SO ON THIS TRAGIC FIRST ANNIVERSARY, I RENEW THE APPEAL I HAVE MADE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST, I URGE PRIME MINISTER HEATH AND SECRETARY WHITELAW TO ACT NOW TO END INTERNMENT, AND TO RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF JUSTICE AND DECENCY AND FAIRNESS FOR WHICH BRITAIN HAS

NORTHER IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PEIOD 4 AUGUST - 10 AUGUST, 1972. 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL 
1. The main political development this week has been the decision of the SDLP to talk to Mr Whitelaw. Discussions at the beginning of the week are due to be followed by further talks today. 
2. On the security front there have been fewer shootings and explosions but a number of demonstrations. Searches by the security forces have yielded substantial finds of arms and explosives, while Martin Meehan, the Provisional IRA leader has been captured in the Ardoyne. 
THE SDLP 
3. Although, following recent military operations, the SDLP had made statements indicating that they were reconsidering their decision to have talks with Mr Whitelaw, they met him on Monday evening, and the talks continued on Tuesday. A Government statement afterwards said ".... 
Among 
the subjects discussed were internment, security policy and the military use of certain facilities in the minority areas. The delegation expressed strong views that internment should now end following the success of the military domination of the former "no go" areas. 
4. The Secretary of State said that he had today shown an earnest of his good intent by releasing 47 internees and he pointed out that he had been following Her Majesty’s Government’s policy by phasing out internment since direct rule by releasing nearly 700 internees. 
5. The Secretary of State took note of the SDLP’s views and undertook to convey them to Mr Heath as soon as possible. A further meeting with the SDLP is to take place in Belfast on Friday. 
6. The SDLP said they did not feel that the release of 47 internees was adequate and have insisted on a complete end to internment. They welcomed the assurances they had been given on the impartiality of arms searches and the Secretary of State’s determination to end private armies, and reiterated the strength of their constituents’ feelings in relation to

military occupation of their areas, and in particular community centres, schools, play centres and playing-fields. They remained convinced that the only way out of the present impasse lay in political means and talks. 
THE UNIONIST PARTY 
7. Mr Faulkner and a deputation from the Unionist Party also met Mr Whitelaw on Tuesday. The Party said that although they welcomed the ending of the no-go areas, they were concerned that this had not been followed up by adequate searches for, or capture of, IRA leaders and their weapons of destruction. They felt that this should be dealt with as a matter of urgency because the protection of life was more important than any political consideration and asked for assurances that when gunmen were intercepted they would either be charged before the courts or held under whatever arrangements the British Government saw fit. They said Mr Whitelaw should resist all pressures to call in legally-held arms and assured him of their full support for a campaign to collect illegally-held weapons in all areas of Northern Ireland. 
8. The deputation reiterated the Party’s wish for early talks between the British Government and elected representatives on the restoration of parliamentary democracy but said that there must first be effective action in dealing with the IRA. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC 
9. The Republic’s Minister for Justice, Mr O’Malley, has appointed four more judges to the special court, while on Wednesday, he made an Order controlling material such as ammonium nitrate or sodium chlorate which can be used in the making of explosives. Under the Order, such materials may be stored only in places certified by the Minister where it must be placed under strict guard. Possession and use must be authorised by a certificate from the Garda. 
THE APPRENTICE BOYS OF DERRY 
10. The route of the traditional march of the Apprentice Boys in Londonderry on 12 August has been restricted to the Waterside district, thus avoiding Roman Catholic areas. Because of this, the organisation decided to call off the march itself confining themselves to initiation ceremonies, and a service of thanksgiving in the Cathedral. It has since appeared however that a splinter group has decided to proceed with the march along the restricted route. 
SECURITY SITUATION 
11. The period was marked by a number of protests and demonstrations on the first anniversary of internment and against the actions of the security forces, in particular over the occupation of premises. The level of shooting incidents and explosions is low compared to the period before Operation Motorman, but there have been security forces casualties.

12. A soldier who had been wounded by a sniper died at the weekend, while another died in Armagh on Monday after he had been hit by a brick thrown by hooligans, and the Ferret Scout Car which he was driving went out of control. Most of those concerned were youths and continued to stone the ambulance and Land-Rover escort which took away the dead men and an injured comrade. An NCO in the Ulster Defence Regiment was machine gunned and killed outside his home in Newtownards on the same evening. The body of a Catholic man was found in a pond near Portadown on Saturday. He had been shot in the head and his body tied to a weighted mattress. A 17 year old youth found with bullet wounds in the Donegall Road area of Belfast on Monday died on the way to hospital. 
13. The bombing campaign has concentrated on the border and rural areas. Two soldiers died and two others were injured when a claymore mine exploded near their vehicles in Linaskea on Monday. 
14. Three soldiers were injured when a bomb exploded in a garage which they were searching in andersonstown. Apatrol was involved in a shooting incident near Crossmaglen on Tuesday when a bomb exploded by the side of the road. Shots were fired and the patrol returned fire, but there were no casualties. 
15. A man was killed when a bomb which had been planted in a garage in Newry exploded prematurely. Three others escaped and the garage was extensively damaged. It is thought the group was involved in planting the bomb. 
16. There have been other explosions in Portggenone, Castleberg, Omagh and Newry as well as Londonderry and Belfast. Martin Meehan, a leader of the Provisional IRA in the Ardoyne area of Belfast, was captured by troops on Wednesday and is being questioned by the RUC. 
17. During Sunday afternoon, a large crowd gathered at Roger Casement Park in andersonstown to protest against its occupation by the security forces. Following a series of speeches a large number of bricks and a petrol bomb were thrown at the security forces, six of whom were injured. Further hooliganism took place on Monday. A deputation from the Gaelic Athletic Association who organise events in the Park, met the Minister of State, Mr Paul Channon to protest about the army’s continued occupation. However, in a letter to the GAA, the Minister said that the army would have to remain there since there had been considerable IRA activity in the area. If there was no further trouble players would be allowed to train at the ground and matches would be open to the public. 
18. Early in the morning of 9 august, anti-internment demonstrations started throughout the Province with the banging of dustbin lids and the blowing of whistles. Those in Londonderry appeared half-hearted and ended quickly, but the demonstrations in Belfast were pursued with more vigour and were accompanied by hooliganism, shouting and some explosions. A NICRA demonstration was held in Roger Casement Park on Wednesday evening. Petrol bombs were thrown at the security forces, and baton rounds were used to disperse the crowd. A NICRA march in Londonderry passed without incident, but elsewhere in the city, anti-internment protests deteriorated into stoning attacks on the army.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND LABOUR PARTY BEGINNING AT 2.45 PM ON FRIDAY 11 AUGUST 1972 AT LANESIDE 
Present: 
The Secretary of State Mr Steele 
Mr Cooper Mr Currie Mr Devlin 
(From 3.05 pm) 
Mr Fitt Mr Hume Mr Jacottet Mr O’Hanlon (From 3.05 pm) Mr McGrady 
The Secretary of State said that, since their last meeting, he had spoken to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Defence and put to them the arguments that the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had put to him on the ending of internment. He reiterated the arguments, ie, that both he and the SDLP have the same objectives; that the SDLP want him to succeed; that they have supported him in the past; and that the political bonus of ending internment would be an end of the civil disobedience campaign. The Secretary of State said that the Prime Minister and Lord Carrington had explained to him that they fully understood the SDLP position and that the views of the SDLP would be considered; however, as yet, no decision had been taken on the ending of internment. The Secretary of State said that he knew that this outcome would disapoint the SDLP but he hoped that they would be patient since more time was needed. The Secretary of State added that it is still HMG’s policy to phase out internment as soon as the security situation permits; the only point of issue between HMG and the SDLP

is on timing. As an earnest of his good intentions, the Secretary of State said that he had that day signed orders releasing 18 more internees including the last of the official IRA. This, with his previous releases, made a total of 65 persons released in a week. The Secretary of State explained the position regarding detainees and pointed out that it was only the Attorney-General who could order their release. 
Mr Fitt asked the Secretary of State whether he felt he would be in a position next week to release more internees. The Secretary of State said that he must reserve his position on this since further releases would depend on events and he could not commit himself or his Cabinet colleagues in advance. Mr Fitt returned to the problem of detainees and the Secretary of State said that he would be talking to the Attorney-General about them. 
Mr. Hume was worried that, with the Secretary of State on holiday, nothing would happen for the next two weeks. The Secretary of State assured him that arrangements had been made to get papers to him and there would be no delays on this account. Mr Hume felt strongly that an opportunity had been lost in not ending internment immediately. The Catholic population were awaiting the outcome of the Secretary of State’s talks with the SDLP and this had caused the present lull in violence. If these hopes that internment would end were dashed the Provisional IRA would exploit the situation and violence would increase. Then, if internment ended, it would be seen as a victory for the Provisionals. Mr Hume also said that if internment were not ended now, the SDLP would be finished politically. They had taken a risk in talking to the Secretary of State and were already being criticised by their own people for talking before the end of internment. Mr Hume’s views that if the SDLP got nothing out of the present talks they were finished were endorsed by his colleagues. 
The Secretary of State said he fully appreciated their position but he again had to make it clear that only himself and his Cabinet colleagues could be the judges on timing.

Mr Cooper said that, at their last meeting when 47 internees were released, the Secretary of State had said that he was worried about Loyalist reaction. In fact, there had been little or no reaction from either the Unionist press or politicians. Mr Hume added that,in his opinion, the Secretary of State was lagging behind public opinion on this issue. The Secretary of State agreed that; on the last occasion, there was not the reaction he had expected and again restated his present position. 
The Secretary of State said that he had that day issued invitations to the political parties in Northern Ireland to attend his proposed round-table conference at the end of September. Mr Hume stated the SDLP’s known policy that they would not attend any conference before the ending of internment. 
At this point (3.05 pm) Mr Devlin and Mr O’Hanlon arrived and, for their benefit, the Secretary of State gave a resume of what had taken place prior to their arrival. Mr Devlin argued that the present piecemeal policy of releasing would mean that internment would end in a way which would benefit no one bar the Provisional IRA - again violence would appear to pay. He felt it should be possible for the Secretary of State to name a date by which time internment would end. The Secretary of State said that he noted this point but felt that it would not be possible; if a date were issued the Provisional IRA would increase their violence to try and ensure that the deadline was not kept to. Messrs Currie, Hume and O’Hanlon again went over the same ground and the Secretary of State again gave HMG’s position. 
By agreement, the Secretary of State then turned to the specific points that the SDLP had raised with him at their last meeting on 7 August. With regard to the alleged biased background briefing received by new Units on arrival in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State said that the book on which the complaint was based had long since been withdrawn from circulation. (Point b. page 6 of last meeting minutes.) 
The Secretary of State explained that the Army had given orders for photography of the "census" type to cease. Mr Devlin raised the case of a certain Mr Kerr who had been photographed the day before and the Secretary of State explained that the Army had admitted to Mr Kerr that this had been a mistake and the photographs and negatives

were being returned to him. With regard to the charge that people are being habitually asked about their income, the Secretary of State said that the Army had no evidence of this (d. page 7.). 
With regard to the alleged difference in behaviour by the Army in different areas of Belfast (e.) the Secretary of State refuted any suggestion that searches are not being made in Protestant areas. Mr Cooper alleged that he had given information in the past about arms in Protestant areas and this had not been acted on. The Secretary of State said that if he had any information he should pass it to his Private Office where it would certainly be considered. 
The Secretary of State said he had no evidence of temporary barriers being erected by the UDA in the Highfield and Springmartin areas but, if such barriers did exist, he would certainly see to it that they were dismantled. (f.) 
The Secretary of State apologised to Mr Devlin about the alleged obscene language used by an Army officer to Mrs Devlin. The Secretary of State added that he would also be writing to Mrs Devlin (h.). 
The Secretary of State said that the Army had agreed that, if stamping people’s hands with an indelible dye was considered degrading, the practice would cease (i.). The SDLP said the practice was certainly degrading and the Secretary of State said that it would be stopped. 
The Secretary of State said that the GOC was investigating the allegation that the UDR were being used as police; the Secretary of State agreed that, if true, this was highly improper. (j.) 
With regard to the wearing of para-military uniforms (n.) the Secretary of State said that he had no legal grounds for banning the UDA, or anyone else, from wearing anoraks. However, the Army were ordering the UDA to remove their masks whenever possible and the Army would certainly not allow them to carry hand cudgels. 
The SDLP appeared satisfied with the answers to their previous detailed complaints and did not raise any further specific points.

The SDLP also raised other points in general discussion such as policy towards licensed firearms; the Army’s occupation of certain schools in Belfast and their request that Republican Clubs and Sinn Fein should be legalised. The Secretary of State answered all these points but, there were no general conclusions and no commitments were made. 
The meeting returned to the subject of internment. The SDLP said they were now faced with the hoice of either attacking HMG’s internment policy or finding a means of maintaining the feeling of hope engendered amongst Catholics by the SDLP talks with the Secretary of State. 
Mr Hume and Mr Devlin again explained that, to keep their credibility as a Party, the SDLP must come out of the meeting with something. From their point of view, talks with HMG must be kept going and they wondered whether they could talk to the British Cabinet direct. The Secretary of State said that he could not agree to this. He expressed the view that, with the continued phasing out of internment, the SDLP could claim to have got something out of their talks with him. He thought that the SDLP could maintain their credibility if, after this meeting, they put out a statement on the lines that they had again put their case to the Secretary of State; that they had been told that HMG would keep the position under review; that they were disappointed that more internees had not been let out; and that the Secretary of State had made it clear that it remained HMG policy to phase out internment depending on the security situation. The talks adjourned at 4 pm so that the SDLP could consider the Secretary of State’s proposition. 
At 4.20 pm the meeting resumed and Mr Devlin explained that he and his colleagues were desperate for more time and that they needed the help of the Secretary of State to retain their credibility until such times as he released more internees. The best way that Mr Devlin and his colleagues could think of securing more time was if they could secure an immediate meeting with the Prime Minister. The Secretary of State said that there was certainly no possibility of an immediate meeting but, to assist the SDLP in keeping credibility, he had no objections to considering the possibility of arranging such a meeting.

of these points were identified in the contingency planning by officials for a situation of complete breakdown; in this context officials are also working on the more drastic legislation which might be required for a comprehensive ban on the holding of firearms or explosives or for the imposition of stricter controls on entry across the Border and are examining the extent of the possible requirement for the maintenance of essential services.) 4. 
The Secretary of State will probably point out that legislation would 
be required to authorise the establishment of special tribunals and to deal with some of the other points which he has identified. He intends to present specific proposals in due course; but he should indicate tomorrow that a choice may have to be made between:(a) 
Recalling Parliament sometime during the Recess, if Ministers decide to proceed with legislation on special tribunals, etc. 
(b) 
Planning to legislate either in the overspill of the present Session or at the beginning of the next Session, with the corollary that in the interim the use of detention under the existing Regulation 11 (perhaps with some amendment which could be made during the Recess under the urgency procedure, subject to Affirmative Resolution when Parliament reassembles) might be justified by a declaration of an intention to introduce new legislation at an early date. 
5. Ministers should therefore decide tomorrow whether they prefer 
(b) to (a), even if detention on the basis proposed may not be legally watertight. They should also ask the Secretary of State whether he has any immediate proposals in respect of individuals whom it might be desirable to detain for an extended period, either for interrogation or otherwise. You agreed yesterday that the CGS, on his current visit to Northern Ireland, should discuss further with the Secretary of State the extent of the requirement for intensive interrogation. 
It is very important that, before 
Ministers separate, we should resolve any ambiguity or differences of view about the style and extent of resumed interrogation. 
sensitive a subject to tolerate any more uncertainty or imprecision. Policy with regard to firearms 6. 
This is too politically The Secretary of State has suggested that you might send to the 
Leader of the Opposition, in response to his questions in the House of Commons last week, a copy of his reply to Mr. Merlyn Rees about the control of firearms in Northern Ireland. The Meeting may also wish to ask

Note of a meeting at noon on 8 August 
CURRENT EVENTS Attacks by gangs on Army observation posts, notably in the Andersonstown 
and Suffolk areas of Belfast, have been a problem. They are probably organised by the Provisionals with the intention of drawing a reaction from the security forces which would alienate the local population. The extent to which the disorders also reflect local feelings generally is uncertain. 2. 
A number of demonstrations are planned for tomorrow to mark the first 
anniversary of the use of internment. INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
The local circulation of rumours, whether simply ill-founded and based 
on suspicion, or maliciously provoked for propaganda purposes, continues to be a problem meriting examination which will be best given in Northern Ireland. 
4. A second news-sheet, called "Death of a Village", dealing with reactions 
to the bombing of Claudy, has been produced and circulated by the Northern Ireland Office. 
YOUTH 5. 
A number of ideas have been put forward for dealing with the hooligan 
problem. These include the channelling of resources into recreational activities, community relations work, and liaison between the security forces and local communities as well as the possibility of penalising the parents of youths found guilty of breaching the peace. But there might be advantage in some expert advice being obtained. INTERROGATION 6. 
A possible new directive on interrogation procedures is still being 
considered by the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence. FIREARMS 7. 
Proposals are being prepared today by the Northern Ireland Office 
on the subject of lawfully held firearms in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office will consult the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the possibility that Mr Lynch should be informed in advance of any statement of policy that is likely to become public.

7 AUGUST 1972 
The Secretary of State Mr Steele Mr McDowall 
Mr Cooper Mr Currie Mr Devlin. Mr Fitt Mr Hume Mr Jacottet Mr O’Hanlon Mr McGrady 
Mr Fitt said that the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had taken a major decision in agreeing to see the Secretary of State in the face of great difficulties. Up to now their attitude had been not to talk until internment was ended. Internment had been widely condemned by politicians from all sides as immoral and contrary to British democracy. It had polarised the community and inflamed passions. Even now the SDLP would be criticised for talking while internmnt continued. But the campaign of terror by the Provisional IRA, especially on ’Bloody Friday’, had convinced the SDLP that they should not allow themselves to be held as hostages to the IRA and internment. The SDLP had always condemned barricades as a symbol of a sick society. 
But Operation Motorman 
had convinced the minority community that harsh military tactics would be adopted against them alone. There had been tanks in the Creggan and the Bogside on the one hand; friendship between the Army and the UDA and the voluntary removal of their barricades on the other. The SDLP had been criticised for providing the Army by their earlier statement with a blank cheque to go into the Roman Catholic areas in strength. Both the Secretary of State and Mr Maudling when Home Secretary had repeatedly referred to the need to retain internment for security reasons, implying that when the security situation was satisfactory the en would no longer be held as hostages. Operation Motorman had put the Protestant community into a state of euphoria and provided the Secretary of State with an opportunity to make a reciprocal gesture by ending internment. The SDLP considered that most Protestants would now agree that there was no longer any reason for internment. Operation Motorman

and the ending of internment should have been parallel actions, and if the opportunity o end it now was missed it might be too late. If violence began again on an increased scale the majority would demand the continuation of internment. The SDLP had made such political sacrifices so far that if the Secretary of State was unable to respond to their approach by ending internment immediately they would be completely discredited in the eyes of the Roman Catholic community. The first anniversary of internment was approaching. If the Secretary of State listened to the SDLP case he would have every justification for ending internment at once. 
The Secretary of State said that he appreciated the dificulties the SDLP had faced. He too had had his difficulties. They should not forget the intense antagonisms he had aroused in the majority community over the previous four months by adopting policies, many of which were consistent with the views of the SDLP. He had tried to be impartial, but had been repeatedly attacked for his efforts. Some of the measures he had taken had been helped by the efforts of the SDLP and he was aware that some of their actions had facilitated the removal of the barricades. ’Bloody Friday’ had made Operation Motorman inevitable. He had been conscious that Londonderry was the key to the situation and that the only possible course was the complete removal of all barricades. Every effort had been made to make the operation impartial, but it was inevitable that most work had been needed to remove the biggest barricades, and these were in the Roman Catholic areas. The object had been to get the Provisional IRA off the backs of the community at large, including the SDLP. Action was therefore especially necessary in the SDLP constituencies. He was however equally determined to take action in the Protestant areas, and there had been substantial arms finds there. He was conscious however that arms finds in Protestant areas seldom attracted the same amount of publicity. He was determined to put an end to private armies on all sides and would do so. He appreciated the arguments advanced for the ending of internment. His problem was primarily one of tiing. The SDLP wanted it to end immediately, but they should consider also what his position would be if he appeared "to dance to their tune", It would be wrng for him to give them any guarantees about the ending of internment. He could not give guarantees to anybody. He had already given evidence of his intention to end internment. But he

grievance, was removed. The continuation or internment on the other hand and the mere presence of troops in large numbers, especially in schools, play centres and sports grounds, was a grievance which continued to encourage support, including financial support, for the Provisionals. For this reason the Provisionals wanted internment to continue. 
The ending of internment would produce an immediate end to the campaign of civil disobedience. 
The Secretary of State said that he took note of the strongly expressed arguments. He had in fact been urgently pursuing the political solution. He hoped that the proposed Conference would provide all parties with an opportunity to express their points of view And in particular to hear the views of others. He was constantly met with the argument that the majority of Roman Catholics were content with the Stormont regime and that everything was satisfactory until the IRA and other troublemakers intervened. The presence at the Conference of the SDLP was essential to demonstrate that this was not so. 
The SDLP representatives said that there could be no question of their attending the Conference while internment continued. For ten years they had expressed their views in Stormont without being listened to. There was no possibility of sitting down for talks with the Unionist Party while that Party was responsible for the continued internment of their constituents. 
The meeting was adjourned at 7 20 pm. 
The meeting resumed at 10 20 pm. The SDLP reiterated their view that internment should be ended, in particular to demonstrate the efficacy of political initiatives. They argued that without political stability violence was inevitable; the ending of internment was the key to the restoration of political stability. The Government had taken an enormous step in suspending Stormont. There was now a danger that unless they took further steps the benefit of that action would be destroyed. They were asking for no more than the restoration of justice. Unless internment were ended the SDLP would have achieved nothing. The Secretary of State should appreciate that they were risking not only their

also had evidence that some of those previously in internMent had returned to terrorism, and he was criticised for the resultant deaths. Some of those still in internment were dedicated to the most extreme forms of violence. 
lie accepted that the SDLP would 
publicly need to emphasise that they had demanded from him the immediate end of internment. 
The other members of the SDLP strongly supported Mr Fitt’s demand for an immediate end to internment. They advanced the following main arguments: 
a. They accepted that the aim of the Secretary of State was to 
achieve a political settlement. The SDP also wanted the reestablishment of politics. But for 50 years in Northern Ireland Opposition politicians had been ignored. The Provisional IRA had met the Secretary of State because violence had succeeded. The UDA were trying to adopt a similar course in demonstrating the success of violence. 
Political discussions had to produce clear 
results; if they did not do so quickly there would, particularly in the week of the first anniversary of internment and the Apprentice boys parade in Londonderry, be further resort to violence and disorder. It was misleading for the Secretary of State to talk of dancing to the SDLP’s tune. They wanted a political response to a political initiative, the case for which was in their view unchallengeable. 
b. In view of the overwhelming numbers of troops in Northern 
Ireland there was no longer justification on security grounds for the continuation of internment. Those in internment had been there for up to 12 months and were not therefore responsible for the most violent acts of terrorism which had since taken place. 
C. The ending of internment was not a concession, but the putting 
right of an injustice. d. 
The Provisionals were now in a state of disarray. Persons 
released from internment were primarily interested in returning to their families. Many of them in fact had a grievance against the Provisional IRA. In any event they could not return to violence unless they regained the support of the minority community. This could not be done if internment, the one outstanding major

political careers but also their lives. The Unionists on the other hand had achieved Operation Motorman, the plebiscite, the exclusion of the Republic from the Conference and the continued activities of the UDA. 
The Secretary of State said that he would consider further the arguments that had been put forward. The timing of further action was critical. By means of careful timing he had succeeded In removing the barricades with the fewest possible casualties. It was not true that the SDLP had achieved nothing; some 700 out of 1,000 internees had already been released. 
The SDLP should not 
underestimate the strength of the views opposing them and the Secretary of State. They must also remember that as a member of the Cabinet he was not an entirely free agent. An immediate total response to the SDLP demands was not possible, but without any commitment hatever he did not rule out the possibility of taking some action to meet their demands. 
The meeting further adjourned at 11 00 pm. It was agreed that any press announcement would be confined to a statement that the meeting had taken place and would be resumed the following day. 
The meeting was resumed at 5 35 pm on Tuesday, 8 August. 
The Secretary of State said that he had thought over what the SDLP had said to him the previous day. As an earnest of his intentions he had just signed release orders for 47 internees. It would be said that he had been persuaded by the SDLP and had done a deal with them, but he was prepared to accept that. A statement would be released to the press explaining that the action had been taken in the light of the new situation in which the security forces were dominating the areas where the IRA had operated in the past. He would consider further, in the light of the security situation, what the SDLP had said. 
At some length the SDLP representatives said that the argument used by the Secretary of State for the release of the 47 internees would apply to all the rest. There was certainly no case whatever for continuing to intern a single member of the Official IRA. The release of 47 internees was totally insufficient in the present Circumstances. The press were clearly expecting a major response

to the SDLP initiative, so were their constituents. The reply from the Secretary of State would demonstrate that political initiatives had again railed. He was now in grave danger or Falling between two stools. 
The rest or the internees were being held as hostages 
to blackmail by the Unionists. Their continued internment would provide encouragement and support for the Provisional IRA. The Unionists had always got their way by threatening a backlash and they were continuing to do so. The Secretary or State should bear in mind that one internee created a whole family of supporters for the Provisional IRA. The security advice 
primarily from the Special branch of the RUC - on which 300 people remained interned 
was the same advice which had interned a thousand men in the first place and which the Secretary or State had properly decided to reject in respect of some 70 men. The SDLP had received nothing but the continued internment of some 300 of their constituents. They would now copletely lose credibility in their communities. The Unionists’ demands were continuing to be et in all respects. 
The Secretary of State said that the release o 47 internees was his immediate response. The SDLP could not expect more at this stage since this was the first occasion on which he had had an opportunity to hear their views and arguments expressed in full. The dividing line between Official and Provisional IRA members was not in fact as tidy as the SDLP implied. The Unionists’ demands had certainly not all been met. They had received assurances on the Border but there was no guarantee that the future constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland would be to their liking. He again emphsised the importance of the SDLP attending the Conference or submitting their proposals to him in writing; without them their case might go by default. Without commitment he would consider the arguments put forward by the SDLP and report to the Prime Minister on Thursday. 
In further discussion the SDLP raised the following main points: a. 
They would welcome an opportunty to meet the Secretary or 
State for Defence to express to him their views on Army activities In Northern. Ireland. They would regard it as politically impossible for them to meet the GOC. 
h. They were concerned at the background briefing received by new

for a predominantly agricultural community. He noted what had been said about the wearing of para-military uniforms. 
It was agreed that there was no objection to press statements by each side recording the discussions which had taken place. It was further agreed that there should be another meeting on Friday, 11 Auust, at a place and time to be arraned. The Secretary of State would at that meeting report the results of his enquiries into the specific complaints and the outcome of his further consideration of the SDLP arguments for the ending of internment.

4 August, 1972 I told your office that I would let you have a 
summary report of the points raised when the Secretary of State saw the Prime Minister this morning. 
swung round again and were once again demanding the end of internment as a condition of talking to him. He explained why he could not end internment, though he might be able to release some more internees. He said that he would ask Dr. Hillery, when he met him later in the day, to put pressure on the S.D.L.P. to talk first and if necessary rumble afterwards rather than try to impose pre-conditions for talks. 
The Secretary of State said that the S.D.L.P. had The Secretary of State talked about the need to 
control the border more closely than at present. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State agreed 
that it was clear from Mr. Lynch’s message ard the Prime Minister’s talk with the Irish Ambassador, that the Government of the Republic wanted to be involved in the talks about the future of Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister hoped that the Secretary of State would make no concessions at all to Dr. Hillery: anything that was done should be done between himself and Mr. Lynch. 
There was some discussion about interrogation and 
intelligence. The Secretary of State outlined his thoughts about 
(i) 
proportional representation, controlling health, education, agriculture, commerce and (at least to some extent) finance. 
A regional council or assembly, elected by 
(ii) Responsibility for the police and the prison service (and possibly for some other "law and order" functions) to remain with Viestminster.

The military staff (apart from medical) will have no contact with arrested persons. 20. ’The army will be responsible at the POs for the recording, collation, military evaluation and dissemination of information on subjects, acting on the instructions of the RUC. The military staff for this purpose will consist of one Intelligence Corps Officer, assisted by three Intellignce Corps NCOs, and clerical and photographic staff. 21. The army will be responsible for providing secure communications between the installations within the interrogation system and the appropriate RUC and military headquarters. Period of Detention for Interrogation 22. There is no statutory time limit to the period for which persons arrested under Regulation 11 of the Special Powers Act can be held for interrogation. 
However, if at the PO a subject 
is recommended for extended uestioning beyond a period of 48 hours after arrest, the approval of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will be sought. Methods of Interrogation 23. The detaild questioning of subjects will begin after an initial assessment of each individual has been completed. This assessment is concerned mainly with the background information on each person, his personality type and his physical and mental state at the time 24. A carefully planned series of questions will thenbe put to the subject. The manner in which these questions are put will vary

2nd August, 1972 18/2/28 The Attorney General has now considered Sir William 
Nield’s paper on preventive detention for terrorist conduct, to which you referred in your Minute of the 31st July. 
The Attorney has noted that the paper rejects any 
suggestion of the creation of a new criminal offence capable of trial within the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal courts. It envisages rather that persons against whom there is insufficient evidence to secure a conviction under the criminal law (including the Special Powers Act provisions) should nevertheless be detained if their conduct has involved them in "complicity in any degree with terrorism generally". The ordinary rules of evidence will not be applied and the normal rights of an accused person in the criminal courts will not be available to him. A decision on whether a person is "guilty" would be made by persons acting on hearsay in the exercise of their discretion. In effect, this would be a substitution of the administrative decision of (now) the Secretary of State by the decision of a committee. 
In these circumstances the Attorney regards it as 
wholly inappropriate to describe the body which is to impose preventive detention as "a court", or to speak of a case being proved against the accused. The Detention Order would depend on the arbitrary decision of this committee which would presumably not be required to state the grounds of their decision. Thus any system of appeal to the High Court would be very difficult if not impossible. 
Such committees (which could be described as tribunals) 
would accordingly be acting under no presently acceptable process of law; they would not be within the tradition of the courts and could hardly be manned by judges whose constitutional duties would make them wholly inappropriate to operate the proposed system. Clearly the Lord Chancellor would have to be consulted if there was any question of judges manning such tribunals.

The Attorney minutes that even in 1940 in the 
United Kingdom there were courts (admittely sitting in camera) which administered the criminal law (e.g., in the cases of spies); and a wholly separate administrative procedure whereby, on the authority of a Minister, persons suspected of disaffection were detained under Regulation 18B. 
The "special courts" now operating in the Republic 
are in fact courts, and they proceed under the rule of law and the rules of evidence. They dispense however with the need for a jury and are manned by selected judges. The reason, apparently, for these courts is: 
(a) lack of confidence in some of their judges, and (b) lack of confidence in their juries. 
Neither of these conditions prevail in Northern Ireland. Some of the process of the special courts in the Republic is in camera, but counsel and solicitors for the accused remain in court and the burden of proof and the rules of evidence remain. 
In the opinion of the Attorney General it would be 
possible to provide by legislation for the establishment of a procedure whereby persons would be subject to preventive detention on the exercise of the discretion of a tribunal which was satisfied that the persons brought before it had been concerned with terrorism. There could also be provided an appeal from such a tribunal to an appellate tribunal, but the creation of such a system for the imposition of preventive detention would require an Act of Parliament. 
I am copying this letter to the recipients of yours 
Minute, and to Kenneth Jones (Home Office), Neil Cairncross (Northern Ireland Office) and Arthur Hockaday (Cabinet Office).

YOUR TEL NO 8. NORTHERN IRELAND. FOLLOWINGS MESSAGE DATED 1 AUGUST ADDRESSED TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER BY THE POPE. 
BEGINS. WE HAVE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE WHICH YOUR EXCELLENCY KINDLY SENT ON JULY 30TH LAST TO INFORM US ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES WHICH HAVE BEEN DECIDED ON BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE REPETITION IN NORTHERN IRELAND OF THE LAMENTABLE ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH HAVE SO SHOCKED PUBLIC OPINION AND SO SADDENED US IN THESE DAYS. 
YOU HAVE ALSO ASSURED US OF THE 
UNALTERED DETERMINATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK FORPEACE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE PROVINCE. 
IN THANKING YOUR EXCELLENCY FOR YOUR COURTESY, WE WOULD LIKE 
TO EXPRESS OUR GREAT HOPE AND CONFIDENCE THAT, IN CARRYING OUT THESE MEASURES; EVERY CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF FURTHER EMBITTERING ATTIDUDES AND WIDENING THE CONTRASTS AND THE DIVISIONS. 
WE REFER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL, 
WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, HAVING ASSUMED DIRECT RULE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, NOTICEABLY ATTENUATED, UNDERSTANDING WELL THE DEEP RESENTMENT WHICH THE MEASURE CAUSED IN ONE SECTION OF THE POPULATION, AND THE GRAVE HARDSHIP WHICH IT CAUSED TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO FAMILIES. 
WHILE WE ONCE AGAIN DEPLORE THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO OBTAIN 
THE RECOGNITION AND DUE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE’S RIGHTS, WE ENCOURAGE THE EFFORTS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND OF ALL MEN OF GOOD WILL AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE DEEP CAUSES OF A SOCIAL AND CIVIL MALAISE WHICH HINDERS THE PACIFICATION OF MINDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HARMONIOUS RELATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.

21 September 1972 
When the Prime Minister saw the representatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party at Chequers last week he said that he would try to give them a written reply this week to their main point that internment should be ended immediately. 
As you will appreciate the Prime Minister’s reply has been dependent on today’s meeting of GEN 79. We understand that the SDLP are still anxious to attend the conference and are hoping for a reply tomorrow. We therefore suggest that the Prime Minister should write to Mr Gerry Fitt MP as follows: 
"When I met representatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party at Chequers last week I promised to let you have the Government’s response to their request for an immediate end to internment. 
You will by now be aware of the statement issued last night by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on security policy, of which I attach a copy. I hope that in these circumstances your Party will now feel able to attend the conference next week". 
Could you please let me know as soon as possible whether the Prime Minister is prepared to write in these terms. If he is we shall, if you agree, arrange for the terms of the letter to be conveyed by telephone to the SDLP in Northern Ireland.

ON SECURITY POLICY 
HM Government it clear, on assuming direct responsibility for the government of Northern Ireland, t hat it was their objective to bring internment under the Special Powers Act to as soon as the security situation permitted; and to 
consider how far the powers conferred under that Act could be dispensed with. 
to use 
HM Government reaffirm these objectives and their determination the processes of law to the fullest possible extent in 
dealing with terrorism. In pursuit of those objectives, since 30 
March 1972, 724 persons have been released from internment 
or detention; 171 persons are still interned and 70 persons are held in detention. During the same period, the law 
enforcement authorities, acting vigorously under the ordinary processes of the criminal law, have achieved considerable success and well over 300 persons have been charged with offences connected with terrorist activities. 
Nevertheless, certain basic problems of countering terrorism 
by the normal processes of law still present difficulties. These include the problem of preventing the intimidation of Witnesses who may be in danger of their lives if they give evidence in court; and of bringing to trial many of those who, although responsible for organising and directing terrorism, take care to avoid so far as possible themselves engaging in terrorist operations. The system of internment cannot be ended without putting something in its place. This does not mean, however, that there cannot be changes.

The Government therefore propose to set up at an early date a commission of experienced lawyers and laymen to advise them on the measures required to deal with terrorist organisations and to bring to book individuals involved in terrorist activities without the necessity to resort to powers of internment; and, in the light of the commission’s report, to prepare substantive legislation to that end. 
The Government reaffirm their determination to improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law. Pending the report of the commission and the subsequent legislation on it, the Government propose to make changes to strengthen the existing law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for membership of unlawful associations. In addition, they intend at an early date to introduce provisions under the Special Powers Act to set up a tribunal to deal with persons suspected of participation in terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will provide maximum safeguards for the protection of the individual and will eliminate the objectionable features of internment, notably judgment by executive decision alone, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland. This tribunal will be asked to consider cases referred to it (which will include cases of those presently in internment or detention) to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities with a view to their release or committal to a period of detention. This procedure is very different from internment. 
The details of these proposals will be explained when the necessary measures are laid before Parliament. But the Government wish to make clear at once that these measures will not in any way be directed against the holding of opinions, but against the use, or encouragement, of violence and terror to force those opinions on law abiding citizens. These interim provisions will be employed only where the ordinary processes of the criminal law are inadequate and will be enforced with complete impartiality against whatever persons or organisations are found to be engaged in terrorism and violence.

possible for the Government to carry through its intention of abolishing internment, or to begin the process of dismantling the Special Powers Act. The Government therefore proposes to set up at an 
early date a mixed commission of experienced jurists and laymen to advise how best the activities of terrorist organisations may be dealt with and individuals involved in those activities brought to book without the necessity to resort to powers of internment, and in the light of the commission’s report to prepare substantive legislation to that end. Meantime, the Government reaffirms its determination to 
improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot easily be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law.

This tribunal will be asked to 
consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either to order release or to impose a definite period of detention. The details of these proposals will be explained when the necessary measures are laid before Parliament.

4. by Course II. 
The Secretary of State considers that our needs would best be met If this is not acceptable on legal grounds, he would 
reluctantly accept Course I, although he would regard this as much less satisfactory on political grounds since it could be regarded as coming "pretty near to the objectionable procedure of internment". 5. 
The Secretary of State hopes to make a public statement tomorrow, 
which will explain his intentions and will strengthen the political and security position so enabling him to make progress towards the achievement of the Government’s political aims. 6. 
In so far as the draft annexed to GEN 79(72) 21 makes it clear that 
the Government are not prepared to end internment pending the creation of new legal procedures, the statement must presumably be regarded as the answer to the SDLP which you promised them at the end of your meeting with them last week. It may well be the decisive factor, therefore, in inhibiting them from attending the forthcoming conference. 
If so, it is 
difficult to see much immediate political advantage in either course. And both courses suffer from the further disadvantage that they would involve legislation; that it would therefore be some time before they took effect; but that, once the preferred course had been given a statutory basis, there would be a natural presumption that it would persist beyond the phase of direct rule into the period of the long-term constitutional settlement 
- with 
the anomalous result that, although the Province would presumably have become more rather than less closely linked with Great Britain, we should have chosen that moment to establish in one part of the United Kingdom an abnormal judicial procedure which would not be acceptable in any other part. 7. 
Nevertheless, the Secretary of State is entitled to claim 
(paragraph 4 of his memorandum) that he cannot go on much longer on the present basis; and the Committee may agree that the long-term political objections to Course II must yield to the immediate requirements of security. The Attorney General rightly refers, in paragraphs 11-13 of his memorandum, to his difficulties in continuing to delay the release of detainees and asks that the Secretary of State should either intern them or transfer to himself, by Order, the responsibility for their release.

8. This leads one to speculate whether the almost inevitable Roman 
Catholic hostility to an announcement in the form of the draft annexed to the Secretary of State’s memorandum might be moderated (with possibly favourable consequences for the attitude of the SDLP) if the announcement was rather more positively worded, particularly by including an undertaking to introduce parallel legislation to dismantle the Special Powers Act, and if, at the same time as the announcement, all except the really hard core internees and detainees were released. 
If this were acceptable in terms 
of security, it would represent a more definite move in the right direction and a more constructive earnest of the Government’s intentions than the essentially negative presentation adopted by the draft statement, particularly in the sentence at the end of the third paragraph. And in any case could not that sentence be phrased the other way round 
as these difficulties are removed the Government will be able to begin 9. 
- i. e. "As soon You will wish to consider whether the upshot of the discussion should 
be reported to the Cabinet which is to follow - especially if the Secretary of State’s statement is to be released later in the day.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 080700 to 110700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 
1. After the Shankill confrontation on Thursday and the march to Tennent Street RUC station by 350 workers from Harland and Wolff on Friday, the wekend turned out to be relatively quiet, considering the potentially explosive situation. For the second successive weekend the level of violence was higher on Sat/Sun (approx 40 shooting incidents - 31 of them in Belfast 
- and 1 explosion) compared with Fri/Sat (24 shootings 
3 explosions) and Sun/Mon (20 shootings 2 explosions). Casualties totalled 3 soldiers killed and 9 wounded; 1 RUC wounded; 3 civilians injured, and 1 terrorist claimed hit. BELFAST saw most of the action. LONDONDERRY was very quiet except for one bomb explosion (30 lbs) which destroyed a cafe. In the countryside, a Northern Resistence Movement meeting was held on Saturday in Armagh, at which the speakers approved the Black September actions in Munich amongst other things and it ended with 39 batons having to be fired to disperse the crowd. 27 Borstal Boys rioted in Armagh Jail. Near Dungannon a 300-400 lb claymore typo device was command detonated on 
70 yards away. It killed 2 and wounded 3 A & SH soldiers in a Saracen. One of the wounded subsequently died. On the border the newly built Customs post at Auchnacloy was destroyed again. In GB weekend press comment concentrated on the deterioration in relations between the Protestant community and the Army in general and 1 PARA in particular. The News of the World had banner headlines concerning an autumn IRA bombing campaign in GB. The Sunday Telegraph carried a revealing biography of John Stephenson. 
Monday night from a dead ground position 2. During Fri/Sat 8/9 Sep 72. It was quiet in Ulster’ except in Belfast 
where a march of about 350 workers from Harland and Wolff to the Tennent St RUC station had all the makings of a possible serious disturbance. However after speeches from Mr Faulkner and other Protestant leaders the crowd dispersed and all was peaceful at 1500 hours. SF were involved in 18 of 24 shooting incidents, in one of these LCPL Taylor, 3 RGJ sustained a minor wound. In the rural areas there were 3 bomb explosions, one extensively damaged the newly built Customs Post at Aughnacloy. Later a claymore mine exploded when a patrol was searching the area. One civilian was slightly injured. It is thought the mine was detonated by radio. In Armagh youths stoned SF. 
3. During Sat/Sun 9/10 Sep 72. There was an increase in shooting incidents. SF being involved in 24 of 35. In Belfast, fire was returned 8 times and initiated 6 times in 19 incidents. 2 hits were claimed. PTE Blackmore 1 LI was slightly wounded by a blast bomb. Londonderry was notably quiet all day. In Armagh following the Northern Resistance Movement parade of about 300 people, 39 baton rounds were fired to disperse the crowd. Later 27 Ranshal boys rioted in Armagh Jail and took themselves to the roof. The RUC remained in charge of the situation throughout.

8 September 1972 
We have made further enquiries of Ministry of Home Affairs as a result of your letter of 22 August about the attempted break-out from Long Kesh. The Governor has confirmed that full inspections are being carried out at six or seven day intervals; it is more effective if the intervals are not too regular. A copy of this letter is being sent to Custis at the Ministry of Defence.

(a) Ministers will have no difficulty in agreeing that we should continue, so far as possible, to use the normal courts to deal with terrorists. 
(b) 
This proposal involves amending Regulation 24.A. to make clear:(i) 
(ii) 
that the proscription of the Irish Republican Army includes the Provisional Wing as well as the Officials; 
that the offence of becoming or remaining a member of a proscribed organisation is extended to include professing to be a member of it or speaking on its behalf, and perhaps financing and fund-raising also. Moreover, any person who is present at a number of meetings of an unlawful association, or speaks on its behalf, will have to prove that he is not a member of it. 
Proposal (i) could be circumvented by changes of name (cf. a recent Intelligence report that the Officials were thinking of calling themselves the "Irish Revolutionary Army"). But there are reasons for not attempting to define a subversive organisation on the lines of Section 3 of the Canadian Act, since either it then becomes necessary to prove in every single case that the organisation in question satisfies the definition or we are in the dilemma of stating conditions which have to be satisfied while declaring arbitrarily that certain organisations satisfy them. Proposal (ii) admittedly reverses the normal onus of proof - i. e. it is incumbent on the defendant to establish his innocence instead of on the prosecution to establish his guilt. But this seems inherent in the nature of the case. 
(c) In favour of the proposal to introduce special courts or tribunals (which is also discussed in Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17) it can be argued that we should in principle be substituting a judicial process for the executive machinery which at present governs internment and detention. But it will undoubtedly be politically controversial to introduce judicial processes different from those of the normal courts (although the Secretary of State deploys the counter arguments in paragraph 5 of the Annex to GEN 79(72) 19); and the Attorney General, who may well be

supported by the Lord Chancellor, is likely to emphasise the difficulty of associating judges with the kind of court described in paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17. 
If Ministers 
are convinced, however, that the introduction of special courts or tribunals would have a material impact in terms of convicting terrorists, the political price may be thought to be worth paying. But, if so, it will be necessary to find room for the necessary legislation; and some other item in the legislative programme may have to be sacrificed. 
(d) A statement of intention to end internment will have political merit both with the Opposition at Westminster and with the SDLP in Northern Ireland. As regards the "hard core" who cannot be released, the Secretary of State proposes that, pending the creation of the special courts, the individuals concerned should continue to be detained under Regulation 11, subject to review by a "special interim body". The Secretary of State recognises that this may be unacceptable to the SDLP, who may withdraw from the projected conference as a result. Since the conference is likely to be unproductive in any event, this price, too, may be thought worth paying. 
(e) To begin to dismantle the Special Powers Act will be politically popular. Paragraph 8 of the Annex to GEN 79(72) 19, however, envisages retaining for the time being those parts of the Act which confer powers on the security forces. These are presumably those relating to stopping and searching, etc; but do they also include the powers of arrest without warrant? 
(f) Given an intention to dispense with internment, there seems no alternative to the detention under Regulation 11 of persons arrested as terrorists until special courts or tribunals are introduced. As pointed out in paragraph 3 of Appendix 3 to GEN 79(72) 17, however, this will certainly be criticised as a disguised form of internment without the provision of the present Regulation 12 for representations to an advisory committee. How far will the proposed "special interim body" meet this criticism? 
10. The practical implications are:- 
(a) Immediate amendment of Regulation 24.A. by Order in Council under the urgency procedure. 
It will be necessary, when Parliament reassembles, to justify doing, in the Recess,

THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT BY SUSPENDING STORMONT AND PUTTING 
THROUGH LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH DISCRIMINATION HMG HAD TAKEN FULLY EFFECTIVE STEPS TO SAFEGUARD THE POSITION OF THE MINORITY. 
IN DOING SO THEY HAD INCURRED CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION, PARTICULARLY FROM UNIONISTS: BUT NO ONE COULD NOW ARGUE THAT HMG WOULD NOT STAND UP TO PROTESTANT PRESSURES. NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS WIDESPREAD FEELING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT THE IRA COULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY SUPPRESSED IF THE REPUBLIC HAD TAKEN ACTION EARLIER. THE GREATER HELP NOW GIVEN OVER BORDER CONTROL WAS WELCOME. BUT UNITED KINGDOM OPINION COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE REPUBLIC DID NOT TAKE FURTHER ACTION, PARTICULARY IN VIEW OF THE STRONG POLITICAL POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC ISSUES WERE DSCUSSED: 
1. 
SEPTEMBER CONFERENCE LYNCH SAID THAT HE SUPPORTED THE CONFERENCE BUT HOPED THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO STRONGER SAFEGUARDS FOR THE MINORITY AND THE RETENTION OF POWER AT WESTMINSTER. HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HOPE TO BE BROUGHT MORE CLOSELY INTO CONSULTATION. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT IT WAS FOR THE NORTHERN IRELAND REPRESENTATIVES AT THE CONFERENCE TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT THEY WANTED. HE HOPED THAT THE MINORITY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH A SINGLE VOICE. IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PRESS AHEAD RAPIDLY AFTER THE CONFERENCE SINCE THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR CARRYING NORTHERN IRELAND LEGISLATION BY ORDER IN COUNCIL WOULD 
REMAIN IN FORCE ONLY UNTIL NEXT MARCH. IT WOULD BE THE TASK OF A SENIOR FCO REPRESENTATIVE AT THE CONFERENCE AND OF HM AMBASSADOR IN DUBLIN TO KEEP LYNCH FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS. MEANWHILE IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IF BEFORE THE CONFERENCE LYNCH COULD MAKE A CONSTRUCTIVE SPEECH URGING BOTH SIDES TO COME TOGETHER. 
2. 
INTERNEES THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT SINCE OPERATION MOTORMAN WE HAD RELEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF INTERNEES AND HAD CHARGED 105 PERSONS. THE SDLP AND OTHERS WHO ARGUED THAT INTERNMENT SHOULD BE ENDED NEEDED TO EXPLAIN WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE HARD CORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO ACTIVE TERRORISM. WHEN LYNCH SUGGESTED THAT CONTINUING INTERNMENT WAS A HELP TO THE PROVISIONALS, THE PRIME MINISTER ARGUED THAT THERE WAS GOOD EVIDENCE, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RECENT OBSERVER ARTICLE, THAT THE PROVISONALS WOULD CONTINUE SHOOTING EVEN IF INTERNMENT ENDED. 
3. CROSS -BORDER RAIDS 
THE PRIME MINISTER POINTED OUT THAT IN THE FIRST TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OF AUGUST THERE HAD BEEN TWENTY EIGHT INCIDENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO IRA CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY. COULD NOT THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT TAKE MORE EFFECTIVE ACTION AGAINST TERRORISTS OPERATING ACROSS THE BORDER? LYNCH REPLIED

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is 
preparing a paper on the ending of internment and on legislation for Special Courts. He wants to have a Cabinet decision on this to enable him, if Ministers so decide, to make an announcement before the Northern Ireland Conference to be held at the end of this month. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland discussed, without reaching a conclusion, the possibility of a meeting on this paper on Monday 11 September. The feasibility of this will largely depend on whether the paper is ready in time. It does not seem essential for it to be discussed before the Prime Minister meets the S.D.L.P. on 12 September: but Mr. Whitelaw would prefer this if it proves possible.

THE CURRENT POSITION OF THE OFFICIAL IRA (DELICATE SOURCE) 
The Official IRA announced nearly 3 months ago their intention to suspend offensive action. Their statement on 29 May reserved the right of selfdefence "if attacked by the British military or by sectarian forces In a statement issued shortly after the operation of 31 July against the ’no-go’ areas they re-affirmed their intention to refrain from offensive action. The Officials have in the past interpreted self-defence as including "retaliatory" attacks. So far as we know, however, no such attacks have taken place since the cease-fire, despite recent operations by the security forces. There is evidence that a few individual members of the Official IRA may on a few occasions have taken part in incidents involving the Provisionals, but the discipline of the group as a whole seems to have remained effective in ensuring compliance with the cease-fire. 
2. The political aims of the Official IRA have always been more complex 
than those of the Provisionals. In their statement of 29 May - the burden of which has since been repeated - the Officials said they would continue their political campaign, including civil disobedience, until their demands were met. These included the release of all internees, a general amnesty for "political prisoners", the abolition of the Special Powers Act, a declaration of freedom of political expression, and the withdrawal of troops to barracks pending their ultimate withdrawal from Northern Ireland. The Officials may feel that all of these demands except the last are at least within the bounds of possibility, and they have continued to press these short-term aims through their front organisations, such as the Republican clubs, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and so on. 
3. In the longer term the Officials hope to achieve a non-sectarian 
Workers Republic in the whole of Ireland. With this object in mind they have always been more willing than the Provisionals to envisage the possibility of working through the political institutions of Northern Ireland - 
as an intermediate measure - and to co-operate so far as they 
have been able with the Protestant working class. Their interest in penetrating the trades union movement and in industrial action is relevant in this regard. So, too, are the recent contacts they claim to have had with UDA members whom they apparently see as appropriate representatives of

the Protestant working class. On the UDA side there have been some indications that some members may be prepared to be sympathetic to this sort of approach. The Officials also appear to have hopes of improving their political position by getting the Republican clubs made legal. 
4. The Official IRA have in the past been under pressure to match the 
violence of the Provisional IRA last they lost the allegiance of their more militant members and undermined their own standing in the Catholic enclaves. They have, however, consistently warned against the dangers of sectarian conflict and gave this danger as one of the reasons for announcing their cease-fire on 29 May. Secret sources have confirmed their feelings in this regard, and the possibility of the UDA getting out of hand must remain a factor in their thinking. At the same time the Officials presumably feel that opinion in the Catholic enclaves has changed in such a way that they are not at present under pressure to match Provisional violence. They can therefore afford to wait and see what happens; if Catholic opinion were to harden again the Official IRA would no doubt find a pretext for "defensive" action against the Security Forces. If it does not, the Officials may hope to profit from the Provisionals’ political bankruptcy. Despite the individual instances of co-operation mentioned in Paragraph 1 above, the two factions remain at loggerheads over basic questions and the evidence we have suggests that the rift between them remains too wide to be bridged. Official IRA statements have condemned Provisional violence in harsh terms as sectarian, and there have been. isolated shooting incidents between the 2 factions. Active co-operation between the 2 seems unlikely unless the enclaves come under direct attack. 
5. Despite the loss of some weapons to the Security Forces we believe the 
military potential of the Official IRA remains at least unimpaired. Some of those released from internment will have made contact once more with the Official IRA but we have no direct evidence to show that any significant number have been re-trained or re-integrated into the Official military structure. Some are likely to have been given a political or back-up role rather than being sent back to join their old units, if only because the ex-internees are well-known to the Security Forces. According to a recent report from secret sources, Official IRA Active Service Units, who had reportedly been ordered into the North just before Operation

not significant in the same way as they were for, e.g. the start of Operation Motorman or the introduction of internment. The fact that the document is to be published is public knowledge, and the Prime Minister has been briefed to give Mr. Lynch an indication of the ground it will cover. 
circumstances it would seem reasonable to hand over a copy a reasonable time before publication. 
The latter is to be on Monday 30 October and our suggestion would be that Peck should 
give him a copy, to be kept confidential until publication, before Mr. Lynch leaves his office for the preceding weekend. He usually spends these near Cork and leaves Dublin on Friday. I should be glad of your agreement that we can give Peck discretion to deliever a copy before his departure, which would probably be Friday 27 October though circumstances might make it desirable to act on Thursday 26 October. 
that Mr. Lynch is being consulted about the matters dealt with in the discussion paper. 
We should regard it as important to avoid any suggestion On the other hand, the document is 
designedly drafted to stimulate the views of the different interests, and it would be reasonable for Peck to say to Mr. Lynch that, if he wished to put forward any views we should be glad to receive them through the diplomatic channel. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt and Andrew. In these 
C. W. Roberts, Esq., 10 Downing Street.

now necessary in Northern Ireland. It was unfortunate that 
the Catholic opposition parties had been absent from Mr. Whitelaw’s recent talks in Darlington. 
Taking up the 
Pope’s last observation, the Prime Minister welcomed such use of the Pope’s influence. 
The Pope could perhaps try to 
persuade, through Cardinal Conway, those who were absenting themselves from constitutional talks to co-operate with the British Government and with other parties who wished to try and get together and find some practical political solution to the Northern Treland problem. (The Pope did not overtly respond to this suggestion.) 
The Prime Minister explained 
the ethnic and religious composition of Northern Ireland and said that the British Government had no doubt that the Northern Irish must themselves decide how they were going to live together. 
The British would certainly have no objection to 
periodic referenda on uniting the two parts of Ireland.On the other hand, the British Government could not force the Northern Irish to join the Irish Republic. 
Meanwhile, he did not 
think we could return to a government by Stormont which Roman Catholics in the Province would not trust. In connection with winning the confidence of the Roman 
Catholic community, the Prime Minister said that the British Government disliked internment just as much as anyone else. The Poe said that it was his feeling that world opinion was against this measure. 
He himself had been brought up to regard Britain above all as the land of liberty and mentioned

He intended to introduce in 
Parliament measures to provide ways and means whereby the Court would be able to protect such witnesses, and in due course this arrangement would even further reduce the number of internees to a very small hard core. The Prime Minister said he hoped that the Pope felt that

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 290700HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 to 020700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was higher than previous weekends over the last two 
months. On Fri/Sat there were 50 shootings and two explosions, on Sat/Sun 53 shooting incidents and 4 explosions. On Sun/Mon 27 shootings and.one explosion. Casualties totaled 2 soldiers killed and 3 wounded ( 1 x VSI); 6 RUC wounded; 18 terrorists claimed hit, and 5 civilians killed and 30 wounded. Most of the trouble was in Belfast with Londonderry and the Rural areas relatively quiet. The major violence was in the Lower Falls area which continued throughout Friday afternoon and evening and seems to have been started by Provisional action against the Officials; -this being a predominately Official area. The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces. 
This 
developed on Saturday into attacks on Security Force posts mainly in the Falls, but died away during the late evening with Sunday being mainly quiet. Meanwhile the Vanguard rally passed off ithout violence. RUC estimates of the attendance were 15000 including a parade of UDA members some wearing masks and carrying cudgels. 
Prayers for Peace meetings took place throughout the province. In Strasbourg it is reported that the Furopean Commission for Human Rights has accepted the admissibility of the Irish Governments’ charges relating to interrogation and internment.

view of the choice they were being asked to make. Mr. Lynch spoke about his meeting with Father Desmond 
Wilson. He had formed a high opinion of Father Wilson’s integrity and judgment. The Army’s activities in East Belfast, as reported by Father Wilson, was a barrier to the improvement of the situation in Northern Ireland. Mr. Lynch referred to the harassment and the searches which were complained of, and to various incidents of intimidation reported by Father Wilson, including the treatment of an epileptic who had been interrogated five times: the first three times he had been treated as an epileptic, but on the last two occasions he had been forced to lie on his back on the floor, a wet towel had been placed over his head, and water had been poured over it to give him the impression that he would be suffocated; then, when he had got up, he had been required to run the gauntlet of batons wielded by the Army. Father Wilson had himself been beaten up by the Army. The Catholics in East Belfast were so frustrated that they no longer thought it worthwhile to complain to the authorities about the Army’s treatment. Indeed, Mr. Lynch said that, though Father Wilson had been to see the Secretary of State only a week after he was beaten up by the Army, he had not thought it worthwhile to mention it in his meeting with the Secretary of State. Mr. Lynch said that the Irish Government wished to

be helpful and to support the British Government in its attempt to deal with violence and to produce a satisfactory evolution of the situation. They were now introducing legislation, which would strain the rules of evidence, so as to transfer to the defendant in any case alleging membership cf an illegal organisation the onus of proof that he was not a member of the organisation in question. In doing this, they were running the risk that the Supreme Court would rule the legislation unconstitutional. The legislation would be introduced on Monday, 27 November, and was expected to have its Second Reading on ednesday, 29 November. The Irish forces were fully stretched on the border. The prison resources of the Republic were already very fully stretched, and further arrests of members of the IRA could produce a difficult incarceration problem. r. iynch referred to the arrest of Sean MacStiofain. 
The security forces had been watching the movements of Joe Cahill. On the night in question he had come out in his car with a passenger. Cahill and his passenger had visited O’Kelly’s house. After they left the house, the forces had stopped the car. The passenger had run away across a field. He had been caught, and arrested; and only at that point did they discover that they had caught MacStiofain. iacStiofain had gone on a total hunger and

thirst strike, and might well not survive. Mr. Lynch did not expect that his trial, which was still going. On at the time when he spoke, would be completed that day. It was against the ethics of the doctors in the Irish Republic to practise forcible feeding. There had indeed been a danger that MacStiofain would not be well enough to appear in Court today: but he had in fact been in Court, weak but apparently not otherwise seriously affected. Mr. Lynch said that the Irish Television Authority 
(RTE) had been asked to explain why they had broadcast an interview with MacStiofain in defiance of a direction given to them by the Government that they should not publicise the views of those who sought to achieve their ends by violence. In their reply they had said that such interviews would not be broadcast except with the express authority of the Director of the Authority or his deputy and/or members of the Authority. The Irish Government regarded this as direct defiance of the Government, and had dismissed all members of the Authority. This dismissal, and the members of the new Authority, were to be announced at 9.30 p.m. that evening. This would certainly be the main subject on which he was questioned on his return to Dublin.. The Prime Minister, replying to Mr. Lynch, agreed 
that the possibility now existed of a significant favourable development of the situation in Northern Ireland. He

curious that he had not complained either to the Army authorities, with whom he was in constant touch, or to the Secretary of State with whom he had had a meeting only a week after the beating up was alleged to have occurred. The Prime Minister was sure that Mr. Lynch would understand, in the light of what he had said, why it was sometimes felt that the priests were playing the IRA’s game. Mr. Lynch did not deny that, in a highly charged 
situation, people might make more of incidents than they really justified. But he thought that the priests had resented the fact that their allegations had been the subject of an immediate official denial by the Army authorities but that, after a few days, the civilian authorities had put out a statement that implied that there was at least some validity in the allegations. The Prime Minister said that the Army statement had been concerned to deny the wide general allegations which had been made, and was justified in so doing. The Prime Minister said that the British Government 
were running into similar legal problems to those of the Irish Government. They had set up the tribunal to deal with the internees, so that they could in effect move over to a system of detention like that available to the Irish authorities. In addition, they had asked Lord Diplock and his colleagues to look into how these matters should

be dealt with in future. He did not yet know how Lord Diplock would report, but it seemed likely that. his recommendations would involve new legislation at Westminster, which would not be easy for the British Government, despite the bi-partisan approach which had so far been maintained. The Prime Minister said that the British Government 
was particularly concerned about the wave of assassinations that had been occurring. He recognised that more Catholics had been murdered than Protestants. The police would be doing their utmost to apprehend the murderers and bring them to justice. The fact remained, however, that there were still 
a great many incidents on particular sectors of the border which were attributable to cross-border activity by the IRA. The Government had been keeping an account of these incidents, and he would be very ready to let Mr. Lynch see the resume which had been submitted to him. The security forces would be ready to co-operate with the Irish police and armed forces to whatever extent and in whatever way the Irish forces thought possible in order to reduce IRA cross-border activity. At the end of the meeting Mr. Lynch re-emphasised 
the desire of the Irish Government not merely to be helpful but actively to support the British Government in its

NIOM 72 (49 NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON FRIDAY 24 NOVEMBER 1. Plebiscite and White Paper 
The Northern Ireland (Border Poll) Bill had received third reading in the Commons early on 24 November. In the debate, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had kept open all options on the relative timing of the White Paper and the Plebiscite. A paper was being prepared on this for GEN 79 the following week. 
2. Security in Border Areas 
GEN 79 would also consider a paper the following week on the documentation of vehicles in border areas. It was noted that the implementation of any such scheme would require very much higher force levels being available to operate vehicle checks, and that this disadvantage was an overriding one. 
Detention Figures 
The ratio of ex-internees being detained by the Commissioners to those being released was running at about 2:1.33 had been detained and 19 released out of the 52 cases referred so far. 
3. GOC’s Draft Directive 
It was noted that the CGS had prepared a new directive to the GOC on Post Motorman objectives. The possibility of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issuing a broad directive for release to the press on Her Majesty’s Government’s security objectives in Northern Ireland was discussed, but the disadvantage of this was that it might be construed as a corrective in the light of recent allegations against the Army by Catholic priests. 
4. Propaganda against the Army 
It was agreed that Ministry of Defence should let Foreign and Commonwealth Office have information urgently to counter the allegations made by the Catholic priests so that Foreign and Commonwealth Office might brief posts abroad. 
Various ways of countering propaganda against the Army were discussed. Ministry of Defence would investigate further the possibilities of: 
i. Disproving specific allegations by conducting their own disciplinary enquiries. 
The difficulty in doing so was that most allegations because they had been so magnified for propaganda purposes, raised questions of criminal liability, and these had to be referred to the civil authorities. 
ii. Producing recordings and film to illustrate the abuse and violence to which troops were subjected by IRA women sympathisers, and the restraint which troops showed in such circumstances.

2. Tribunals 
The Commissioners started their hearings on 10 November. Administrative arrangements at Long Kesh had been completed. 
3. Prime Minister’s Visit 
There was a working party at Stormont Castle under Sir Harold Black, on which the Army were represented. Mr Williams was co-ordinating arrangements at the London end. 
4. Arrest Policy 
MOD stressed their need for a directive on arrest policy for Protestant extremists. It was agreed that any new policy would have to be settled at the highest level. 
5. Army Reinforcements during the Plebiscite 
It was noted that from MOD’s point of view the preferred date for the Plebiscite was in the last fortnight of January. This would be the most convenient time to provide Army reinforcements. 
A further important factor in determining the date of the Plebiscite was its timing in relation to the subsequent publication of the White Paper.

4. 
Plebiscite The Bill is expected to be laid on 1 November and published next day. 
5. Tribunals 
The Order-in-Council will go to the Privy Council on 1 November, and be laid on 6 November. Security arrangements for the hearings by the Tribunal were discussed. The review of internment orders and detention orders would probably take place at Long Kesh. 
6. Bail 
The granting of bail in Magistrates’ Courts was further discussed. Summing up, Sir William Nield said that 3 possible courses of action should be followed up: 
(i) (ii) 
The appearance in Court of persons charged (eg with offences connected with rioting) could be postponed 24 hours. 
The presentation of cases in which bail was opposed could be improved by the Police, notably by using lawyers skilled in this type of work. 
7. 
(iii) The procedure for guidance to Magistrates should be explored further. Diplock Commission 
The possibility had to be faced that the Commission might report that there was no effective alternative to internment. In case this should happen, 
it was all the more important that the Tribunals should be seen to be operating fairly and effectively.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NON ON 15 DECEMBER 
The report will be considered by GEN 79 on 18 December. The present intention is that it should be published on 20 or 21 December and that a statement should be put out to the effect that the Government accepts the report in principle. The Chairman said that legislation to implement the Diplock report would have to be seen in the context of the repeal of the Special Powers Act, and also of the constitutional proposals in the White Paper. 
In discussion, it was noted that the time taken to implement the Diplock report need have no direct bearing on the security situation, since the object of the report was mainly to 
replace and not to reinforce existing special powers. 2. Border Poll 
The Secretary of State has announced that the Poll will be held on 8 March and the draft Order has been laid. 
3. Assistance for the RUC 
Discussions are continuing between the Home Office and the RUC on the provision of detectives to strengthen the CID of the RUC 
4. Ministerial Directive to the Army 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Defence have agreed that a joint Ministerial Directive to the Army should not now be issued. 
5. Vehicle Documentation: Border Control (see paragraph 8 of minutes of 8 December) 
A further proposal for control of vehicles on the border is now being examined. It is proposed that under Regulation 33 of the Special Powers Act all vehicles using unapproved border roads should be required to have a permit. This would be similar to the concession pass system operated under Customs Regulations, vh ich for various reasons is less practicable to enforce. The proposed new system of permits is being cleared with Legal Adviser. A draft paper will then be circulated, with a view to a report being made to GEN 79. 
6. Mr Lynch’s Reaction to the Dossier 
Further instructions to Her Majesty’s Ambassador in Dublin are now being drafted and will be sent next week, asking HMA to seek more positive assurances from the Irish Government about co-operation by the Gardai and Irish Army over border incidents. 
7. Army Reaction to Provisional IRA Ceasefire 
It was noted that the Secretary of State for Defence had agreed the guidance proposed by Sir William Nield at the NIOM on 1 December (paragraph 3 of those minutes).

The passing by the Dail of the Offences Against the State 
(Amendment) Act 1972 has naturally given rise to speculation about the extent to which members of the I.R.A. and other extremists would seek sanctuary in this country. 
There are two problems. One, stopping I.R.A. members getting 
into Great Britain. Second, expelling those who get past our defences. There is no reason to suppose that the I.R.A. are planning any campaign of violence in Great Britain 
, but we certainly do not want Great 
Britain to become the haven for I.R.A. extremists that Southern Ireland has been hitherto. On the first point, although the Irish traffic is now being watched by the police at ports of entry, there is obviously a limit to the success which the police might have in picking out individuals without any advance intelligence, and we cannot put all the Irish traffic through an immigration control.

A statement of y powers is set out in the Annex. When the 
new Act is in force on 1st January, I shall have adequate powers to refuse leave to land to identified Irish citizens who are members of the I.R.A. and to exclude from this country those who are identified later, and I have assured the Commissioner that I shall use these powers to the full. 
In addition, I am advised that if a warrant of arrest has been 
issued for an offence in Northern Ireland against an individual who is in this country, including the offence under the Special Powers Act of being a member of the I.R.A., then that warrant can be backed and executed by the police in Great Britain. 
On my present assessment therefore I am against amending the law 
The gap in my defences is that I have no effective powers to deal with members of the I.R.A. who are our own citizens by birth 
in 
(whether/Great Britain or in Northern Ireland) and against whom there is no Northern-Ireland warrant of arrest. There would for example be no prospect of "extraditing" an individual to Southern Ireland (under the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965) for the offence of being a member of the I.R.A., first because this is not an offence under our law; and, secondly, even if it were the Courts would almost certainly throw out any such application on the grounds that it was a "political" offence. 
It has been suggested that this gap should be closed by proscribing 
the I.R.A. in this country, a coursewhich has been pressed on me on general grounds from a variety of quarters. There has been similar pressure to take powers to proscribe Arab terrorist organisations. 
You will be familiar with the difficulties, which were gone into 
in some detail when a possible clause was drafted before we took over direct rule in Northern Ireland. Under our rules of evidence, a law 
to proscribe the I.R.A. and I think that there was a lot of sense in the Times leader today. 
But circumstances may change. If the I.R.A. mounted a campaign of violence in the UK we should 
have to think again - although we might then want to act on the lines of the 1939 Prevention of Violence Act (but perhaps not limited to Irish affairs). This would raise the ghastly problem that it might become essential to reintroduce a system of control at the ports between all Irish traffic and Great Britain. I am having all this looked into further on a contingency basis. 
Then we have to bear in mind the Diplock enquiry. As I understand 
it, this body is considering what arrangements for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland could be made in order to deal more effectively with terrorist organisations by bringing to book, otherwise 
proscribing the I.R.A. would be difficult to enforce; and the new law of evidence which has been adopted in the Irish Republic, owing to the ineffectiveness of their previous law, would be quite unacceptable to Parliament here. There is also the problem that Irish extremists belong to a variety of organisations and clubs, and new ones are created; so there would have to be a continuing power to proscribe organisations. 
This presumably would have to be by subordinate instruments, subject to affirmative resolutions, a prospect which is singularly unattractive.

than by internment by the executive, individuals involved in terrorist activities, particularly’those who plan and direct but do not necessarily take part in terrorist acts.. If, at the end of the day, its report leads to legislation at Westminster altering the laws of evidence in Northern Ireland to enable members of terrorist organisations to be more effectively dealt with there, we should have to consider very carefully whether any of the recommendations had application to the present or foreseeable situation in Great Britain. 
On Thursday, I shall have to deal with a number of Questions 
inviting me to legislate against the I.R.A. in this country. I think that I am bound to take the line that on present information I am not persuaded that there are grounds for seeking fresh powers from Parliament; but that certain precautions have already been taken; that I shall not hesitate to use the extended powers given me under the new Immigration Act; and that I shall continue to keep the position under very close scrutiny. 
I am sending a copy of this minute to the Secretary of State for Scotland., Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Sir Burke Trend.

CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: POWERS TO REFUSE ADMISSION, AND DEPORT 
Until 31st December 1972 1. 
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 as being contrary to the interests of national security. 
There is no right of appeal. 2. There is no power to deport an Irish citizen who has 
succeeded in entering unless he is convicted by a court of an offence punishable by imprisonment and is recommended for deportation. A recommendation cannot be made if he is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the preceding five years. 
3. But if a person is missed at the port the power to refuse him 
admission can be exercised if he is found within 28 days of entering and is then required to submit to examination by an immigration officer. 
After 1st January 1973 4. 
From 1st January 1973 the power to refuse leave to enter will 
be wider. It will no longer be restricted to grounds of national security, but can be exercised whenever it is not conducive to the public good to allow the person to enter the United Kingdom. There will be no right of appeal if the decision to deny entry on conducive grounds has been taken by the Home Secretary personally. 
5. From 1st January the power to deport will be wider. It will 
be possible to deport a citizen of Ireland on the ground that his presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good. Length of residence will no longer be a defence. (This extension of powers will not apply to a citizen of Ireland who has been continuously ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom since before 1st January.) 
6. Where the Home Secretary decides to deport a citizen of 
Ireland on not conducive grounds, there will be no right of appeal against the making of the deportation order if the basis of the decision is national security or political grounds. 
There will 
be a non statutory facility to make representations to three advisors, whose report the Home Secretary will have to consider before signing a deportation order. It is envisaged that the hearing would take place in camera. 
7. While there will be no right of appeal against the making of 
the deportation order, there will be a right of appeal if the citizen of Ireland objects to the country to which he is to be removed (Ireland). This appeal would be heard by the normal immigration appeal machinery, and such an appeal is unlikely to be successful unless the person concerned can show that a third country is prepared to accept him. A recent decision of the Court of Appeal confirms the view that on an appeal against the country of destination it is not open to the appellant to raise the issue of political asylum, and that the appeal is confined to the narrow point of whether he should be removed to the country named in the removal directions citizen. 
- almost invariably the country of which he is a 
Until 1st January 1973 admission can be refused under the Given advance intelligence this 
Dower of refusal can be exercised, and has been exercised in two cases in recent years.

The major gunbattle in the Ardoyne on 26 November which involved IRA

abuse shown to the SF and the sympathy shown by local people in Andersonstown to a soldier badly wounded in an explosion. 
Encouraging signs have been seen in the decrease in The imprisenment of 
Stephenson and his well publicised hunger and thirst strike have provoked surprisingly little reaction in the North, although a certain amount of hooliganism has been evident and there was a rally in Londonderry in protest.

10. Licensed Firearms and Dealers. The armed raid on a sports shop in 
Belfast on 21 Pebruary and the theft of 40 pistols and 4,800 rounds of assorted ammunition produced impetus for action against licensed firearms.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is considering further action including: 
a. Limiting the number of dealers and possibly only allowing 
sale by catalogue. b.

Limiting the number of guns to a maximum of 1 per household. Ballistically ’finger printing’ all hand guns. Increasing the powers for withdrawing licences and 
controlling the movement of firearms. 
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND 11. Election.

National Coalition 73 (Fine Gael 54, Labour 19) Fianna Fail 
69 Independents 2 
This, by Irish standards, gives the new government a substantial majority. Mr Cosgrave, the leader of Fine Gael, is forming a new government which will take office after the new Dail convenes on 14 March 1973.

ANNEX E TO 240 G DATED 13 FEB 73 
POLITICO/MILITARY SUMMARY OF 1972 1. The only safe assessment of 1972 is to see it as a build-up period to the 
climax expected in 1973. In political terms this is undoubtedly the case; but in military terms it seems at least possible that historians will identify the climax in 1972, and regard subsequent events as part of a period of consolidation. 
2. 1972 started on an uncertain note. The Provisional. and Official wings of 
the IRA had been seriously weakened by the internment operation, but Catholic opposition to the Government remained strong. In an effort to harness this sentiment to subversion the IRA through such front organisations as NICRA organised illegal marches. This policy bore fruit on 30 January 1972 when an exchange of fire in Londonderry between security forces and gunmen escalated into a relatively large-scale action with 13 fatal civilian casualties. From that day onwards a change in Government policy seemed inevitable, not because extant policy was necessarily wrong, but because it bore the mark of being wrong. 
3. On 24 March 1972 HMG introduced Direct Rule and Secretary of State Whitelaw 
sought to achieve reconciliation with Ulster Catholics without unduly alienating Ulster Protestants. He came close to success when in May the Officials called off violence and in June the Provisionals declared a ceasefire. Unfortunately the Provisionals had interpreted HMG’s concessions as a sign of weakness and had agreed to a ceasefire only because they saw this as a preliminary to Government surrender to all their demands. When this proved to be a false assumption they reverted to violence. 
4. Although these efforts failed to achieve peace they did at least deprive the 
IRA of its heroic image in the eyes of Irish Catholic opinion, not to mention world opinion. By mid-July the Provisionals, though stronger in numerical and material terms than ever before, had lost the battle for sympathy and respect which is an essential preliminary to military success. Their bombing campaign was largely discredited and only the existence of the Londonderry ’No-Go’ areas kept alive their dream of a "final take-over of the North". The real importance to a guerrilla force of "liberated areas" is the evidence which such areas appear to provide of a gradual and remorseless seizure of power providing in its wake safe havens within which revolutionary leaders can posture before the world’s TV cameras. The apparent unwillingness of the Government to deal with ’No-Go’ areas gave hope to subversives that the Government could be blackmailed by fear of civilian casualties into surrender. In so far as this unwillingness was for a time real, the value to the IRA of Bloody Sunday may be seen as crucial. 
5. Operation MOTORMAN put an end to all this. The subsequent struggle to 
neutralise the IRA has been and remains hard. But whilst we have yet finally to defeat the IRA, any real prospect that they might beat us vanished when the Saracen APCs drove virtually unopposed into the Bogside and Creggan in the early light of 31 July. 
6. The triumph of the first 4 months of Direct Rule was the discrediting of the 
IRA. The tragedy was a strengthening of the belief in all communities in the effectiveness of violence as a means of influencing political events. It is this belief that gives rise to apprehension over Protestant reaction to HMG’s White Paper in early 1973. If the worst fears are realised then the coming year may indeed build up to both military and political climax; if, however, it is possible to contain extreme Protestant militancy within a minority section of that community, then the level of violence may have less than Doomsday proportions and the climax may be political only.

TO IMMEDIATE FCO TEL NO 154 OF 23 MARCH/SAVING UKREP BELFAST WHITE PAPER: PROVISIONAL SINN FEIN REACTIONS 1. 
ON 22 MARCH THE PROVISIONAL SINN FEIN SAID THAT THEY DID NOT 
BELIEVE THAT THE WHITE PAPER PROPOSALS REPRESENTED.A GENUINE OR REALISTIC BASIS FOR SOLVING THE NORTHERN PROBLEM OR EVEN HELPING TO SOLVE IT. THE PROPOSALS ON POWER-SHARING AND BALANCED COMMITTEES WERE ARTIFICIAL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL STATE WORK AND THE PROPOSED ALL-IRELAND CONFERENCE ARE-RUN OF THE ABORTIVE DARLINGTON CONFERENCE’’. 
2. ’’HAVING BEEN RESPONSIBLE.FOR THE DEATHS OF OVER 450 IRISH 
PEOPLE SINCE 1969, HAVING INFLICTED TORTUTE ON PRISONERS, HAVING INTERNED OVER 1,000 MEN AND WOMEN, ENGLAND CANNOT POSSIBLY BE REGARDED NOW AS AN HONEST REFEREE. 
THE VAGUE COUNCIL 
OF IRELAND IS MERELY A SOP REPETITION OF ARTICLE 12 OF THE TREATY OF 1921 WHICH IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND ACT OF 1920. 
THE NEW STORMONG ASSEMBLY WHICH IS PROPOSED WOULD HAVE LITTLE REAL POWER. THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MR WILLIAM WHITELAW, WOULD BE A VIRTUAL DICTATOR, OPERATING BY ORDERS-IN-COUNCIL FROM WESTMINSTER. WE ARE GLAD TO SEE THAT A LARGE SECTION OF THE LOYALIST PEOPLE RECOGNISE THAT WHAT IS PROPOSED IS A MEANINGLESS ASSEMBLY. WE EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL LOOK AGAIN AT SINN FEIN’S PROPOSALS FOR A NEW STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT IN ALL IRELAND AND PARTICULARLY AT OUR PROPOSALS FOR A NEW STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT IN ALL IRELAND AND PARTICULARLY AT OUR PROPOSALS FOR A NEW ULSTER PARLIAMENT OF NINE COUNTIES (DAIL ULADH) WHERE THE UNIONIST-ORIENTED PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A WORKING MAJORITY, AND WHERE THE PEOPLE OF ULSTER WOULD HAVE A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE

OF AUTONOMY, GIVING THEM REAL POWER OVER THEIR OWN AFFAIRS. WE AE HEARTENED BY THE INTEREST ALREADY SHOWN BY SOME UNIONIST SPOKESMEN IN OUR PROPOSALS. WE ARE PREPARED TO MEET THEM AT ANY TIME FOR OPEN-ENDED DISCUSSIONS ON HOW BEST THE INTERESTS OF THE ULSTER PEOPLE CAN BE SERVED. 
IT IS TOO MUCH TO EXPECT THAT THE WHITE PAPER PROPOSALS WILL BE ACCEPTED WHILE 650 PEOPLE ARE INTERNED, AND WHILE THE HARASSMENT AND SECTARIAN KILLINGS CONTINUE. THE REPEAL OF THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT IS A FARCE WHEN IT IS TO BE REPLACED BY NEW LEGISLATION BASED ON THE DIPLOCK PROPOSALS, WHICH WILL INTRODUCE NON-JURY COURTS (SUCH AS OPERATE IN DUBLIN UNDER THE OFFENCES AGAINST THE STATE ACT) AND MERELY CHANGE ’INTERNMENT’ TO ’DETENTION’ COMPLETE WITH STAR CHAMBER TRIBUNALS AND WITNESSES BEHIND CURTAINS. JUST WHOM DOES MR HEATH THINK HE IS FOOLING? 
SINN FEIN AND ALL THE IRISH PEOPLE ARDENTLY DESIRE PEACE. PEACE MUST BE BASED ON JUSTICE: IT CANNOT BE BASED ON INJUSTICE. THE GREAT INJUSTICE INFLICTED ON THE IRISH NATION IN 1920-21 HAS STILL TO BE REMOVED. EVERYBODY LONGS FOR AN END TO VIOLENCE. BUT THE VERY CREATION AND EXISTENCE OF THE SIX-COUNTY STATE REPRESENT VIOLENCE, A GRIEVOUS VIOLENCE DONE TO THE IRISH PEOPLE. IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THAT STATE FOR 50 YEARS EXCEPT BY VIOLENCE AS EXEMPLIFIED BY SPECIAL POWERS AND INTERNMENT IN EVERY DECADE. 
THE WHITE PAPER IS BASED ON THE ORIGINAL VIOLENCE OF THE 1920 GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND ACT, REINFORFED BY THE 1949 IRELAND ACT. THAT BEING THE CASE, IT REINFORCES INJUSTICE AND VIOLENCE, LEADS TO COUNTER-VIOLENCE AND POSTPONES THE DAY OF TRUE AND LASTING PEACE. 
THE REASONABLE DEMANDS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN 1968 WERE OPPOSED AND VIOLENCE ENSUED. THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION OF 1969 FAILED BECAUSE IT WAS ’’TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE’’. THE SUSPENSION OF STORMONT IN 1972 FAILED FOR THE SANE REASON. THIS ATTEMPT WILL ALSO FAIL BECAUSE IT ALSO IS ’TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE.’ BECAUSE THE. WHITE PAPER FAILS TO TACKLE. THE MAIN ISSUE IT WILL FAIL TO DELIVER JUSTICE AND PEACE. 
THE ONLY WHITE PAPER WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A PERMANENT PEACE IS ONE IN WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT RELINQUISHES ITS INTEREST IN EXERCISING SOVEREIGNTY OVER ANY PART OF IRELAND: DECLARES ITS RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE ISLAND OF IRELAND TO CONTROL THEIR OWN AFFAIRS SEMICOLON AND ANNOUNCE A DATE FOR DISENGAGEMENT AND WITHDRAWAL. 
WE ASK ALL THE IRISH PEOPLE TO DEMAND THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DO LIKEWISE AND MAKE PERMANENT PEACE POSSIBLE IN IRELAND."

Dr. Fitzgerald said that he and his colleagues hoped that the 
British Government would be able to let them have a copy of the White Paper somewhat in advance of publication, so that they could have time to prepare their comment and make it as helpful as possible. The Prime Minister said that he would let the Irish Government have a copy of the White Paper in advance of publication, though it could not be long in advance. 
Dr. Fitzgerald noted with a smile that 
when he was in Northern Ireland both the Unionists and the SDLP had told him that the White Paper was expected to be published on Tuesday 20 March. Dr. Fitzgerald asked the British Government’s intentions on 
internment. The Prime Minister said that the British Government 
had changed the basis on which people were detained in Northern Ireland.

Once this was done, these matters As regards 
those who were now in detention, as the law and order situation returned to normal, release of detainees could go forward. 
The 
Prime Minister reminded Dr. Fitzgerald that the number of people being charged for security offences and brought before the courts was now very considerable. Dr. Fitzgerald said that he had heard on the news shortly before 
coming to Downing Street that Mr. Paddy O’Hanlon, M.P., had been arrested by the Army. It was clearly undesirable to have an SDLP Member of Parliament locked up at this critical juncture, not long before publication of the White Paper, and Dr. Fitzgerald hoped that Mr. O’Hanlon could be released as soon as possible. He could not believe that Mr. O’Hanlon had really been guilty of security offences.

(5) They wished to co-operate with the White Paper but it was essential that they could identify with any new institutions.. In the past they had not been able to identify with, for example, the police and the courts. Power-sharing must be seen to be operative at all levels. National Boards, for example the Pig Marketing Board, had always been run by the Unionist Party. The Secretary of State said that a basis had first to be established from which both sides could say how power-sharing should be achieved. He pointed out that he had endeavoured to ensure a fair Roman Catholic representation on Boards under his control but he warned that further changes would necessarily take time. 
(6) No group, including Republican Clubs and Sinn Fien, should be debarred from taking part in forthcoming elections. The Secretary of State said he would consider this proposal. 
(7) In any forthcoming elections in which PR should be used, consideration should be given to using the List system as opposed to the Single Transferable Vote system. 
(8) It was desirable to engender a climate of goodwill at the time of the publication of the White Paper and for this reason they had established a dialogue with loyalists in an attempt to find common ground. There would be advantage at the present time in a conciliatory gesture by, for example, releasing some men from Long Kesh. 
(9) They were mindful of the possibility of violence from both sides when the White Paper was published. They felt that there might be a spate of bombings by the Provisionals before the White Paper, although they thought there might be a cease-fire after its publication. The Secretary of State explained that he too was mindful of the possibility of an escalation of violence at the time of the White Paper and had planned accordingly. 
(10) Where possible there should be local fiscal autonomy allied to public ownership. The Secretary of State said that he would bear this point in mind. 
(11) They asked whether they could receive advance copies of the White Paper. The Secretary of State said he would consider this request. 
In conclusion the Secretary of State made it clear that there would be an opportunity for all groups to make their views known after the White Paper and before the Constitutional Bill. Under such circumstances there would be no excuse for a violent reaction to the White Paper from any quarter. He urged the SDLP to look for features with which they could agree in the White Paper and be prepared to discuss other issues.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE UNITED 
Secretary of St e Mr F Steele Mr T Roberts Mr T Platt 
Hull 
LOYALIST COUNCIL AT 12 NOON ON WEDNESDAY 14 MARCH IN STORMONT CASTLE Present: 
Herron 
Mr Henderson Mr Green Mr Crowe 
The Secretary of State said that the United Loyalist Council (ULC) had asked to see him again, and in accordance with his previous undertaking he had agreed to see them before the publication of the White Paper. There was a number of points which he wished to put to the ULC. The fact that the Border Poll had been held, its form and timing, demonstrated that the British Government could be trusted to keep their word. The result of the Poll would be fully honoured by the Government, and this would be made clear in the forthcoming White Paper. There was therefore no justification for any fear of a "sell out" and certainly no justification for any form of violence. He hoped that the White Paper would be carefully considered. It would not be an end in itself and there would be opportunity for the proposals to be modified in the light of representations and discussions. If despite what he had said people turned to violence the full force of the security forces would be used to suppress it. 
Mr Henderson said that the ULC were mostly not politicians, they were simply patriots interested in the future of their country. They were particularly concerned about the security situation, the failure of the security forces to take up their offers of assistance and the use of detention against Loyalists. 
Mr Hull said that before the introduction of Direct Rule he had led a demand for internment. He fully accepted that if people committed subversive acts the State had to take action. But he was concerned about the treatment of Loyalists. Some had been arrested in their houses during the night and their families abused. Internment was being improperly used in order to get people out of the way before the publication of the White Paper. He was convinced that some of the Loyalists detained under Interim Custody Orders could not have been guilty of subversive acts. Mr Herron said that by their acts the Army were alienating the Loyalist community and encouraging the establishment of a Protestant counterpart to the IRA. 
There might in the past have been Ulster Defence Association (UDA) clubs selling

Message to the Pope on Internment The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of 
State for Northern Ireland agree (as does Tom Bridges) that it will be helpful for you to send a further message to the Pope explaining the present position on "internment" - as he persists in calling it and expressing the hope that the Pope will be able to make a public and welcoming reference to the White Paper. When Mr. Whitelaw lunched today with Cardinal Heenan he 
discovered that the Cardinal had very little idea of the new procedures for detention. 
Cardinal Heenan said that he did not 
believe that the changes we have made were understood in Rome. In the light of this conversation and of the Cardinal’s favourable reaction to what he was told, Mr. Whitelaw thinks that there is all the stronger case for sending a further message to the Pope. I attach the following documents:- 
A draft introductory telegram to our Minister to the Holy See (Flag A’) 
A draft message from you to the Pope (Flag ’B) 
A memorandum which the Minister would deliver with your message (Flag ’C’)

MY TWO IPTs: NORTHERN IRELAND Following is the text of the memorandum: 
BEGINS "When HMG assumed direct responsibility for affairs 
in Northern Ireland in March 1972, the Prime Minister stated the government’s intention to make a start in the process of bringing internment to an end. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland reviewed personally the cases of all those who had been interned, and, the Prime Minister said during his conversation with His Holiness in October, the great majority were released.

2. The procedures for internment which HMG had 
inherited were far from satisfactory, and there was the general question whether any special procedures for detention were necessary at all. The Government therefore appointed a Commission, composed of distinguished laymen and lawyers, and chaired by a most eminent judge of the House of Lords, Lord Diplock. The Commission was asked to find out whether terrorist activity could be dealt with by the criminal courts. In December 1972 they reported that, because witnesses were intimidated or afraid to give evidence, no criminal procedure which satisfied the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights could effectively bring terrorists to justice. 
3. While the Commission was deliberating, the 
Government proposed, and Parliament in Westminster approved, the abolition of internment by the Executive as it had been practised

Ireland law, and the enactment, as an interim measure pending the Commission’s Report, procedures for detention. 
4. 
Specific safeguards were incorporated, which have been in operation since 7 November 1972, as follows:

(a) no-one may be detained for more than 28 days without his case being referred for adjudication to an independent, legally-qualified commissioner; 
(b) the commissioner must enquire into any case referred to him to see whether the person has been concerned in terrorism, and, if so, whether his detention is necessary for the protection of the public; 
(c) a person detained by order of a commissioner has a right of appeal to an independent tribunal; 
(d) a person appearing before a commissioner is given in advance a statement of the terrorist activities he is alleged to have engaged in; 
(e) such a person may give evidence and be legally represented. 
This is a far cry from internment. Where these procedures contain departures from the normal judicial process 
the commissioners’ inquiries are in private, 
for example, and the person who is the subject of the enquiry may be excluded from parts of it) these are necessary because, as the Commission reported, witnesses will not give evidence in the ordinary courts. The procedures contain all possible safeguards against injustice.

5. No-one is now detained except under these 
procedures and those detained have been found by an independent commissioner with legal training and experience to have been involved in terrorism and to be someone from whom the public need to be protected. The Government would greatly prefer it if the ordinary criminal procedures were effective in bringing these people to justice, but the findings of the Diplock Commission 
and cannot be so effective 6. 
that they are not HMG therefore propose, in legislation which is 
now before Parliament, to confirm the new detention procedures, but to provide for them to lapse after 12 months unless they are renewed for a further period by Parliament. It will become clear(once the Bill is passed) that detention procedures are temporary and that, given an end to the appalling conditions which make them necessary, they will be allowed to lapse. H.M. Government have no intention of keeping these provisions in force a moment longer than is necessary.

White Paper on Northern Ireland: Exchange of Messages with the Pope 
Thank you for your letters of 9 and 10 April. While believing that the Pope’s attitude hitherto 
hardly suggests he will give a forthright lead, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary agrees with the Prime Minister that it would be helpful to send a further message explaining the present position on "internment" (as the Pope persists in calling it), and expressing the hope that the Pope will be able to make a public and welcoming reference to the White Paper. 
Self-explanatory draft telegrams are enclosed. 
These have been prepared in consultation with the Northern Ireland Office, and have been seen and approved by Mr. Whitelaw. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt in the Northern Ireland Office.

PRIME MINISTER Below is a telegram from the Minister to the Holy See 
commenting on the Pope’s message to you. I am not convinced by Mr. Crawley’s argument against 
your sending a further message. A personal explanation from you of what we have done on internment will make much more of an impact on the Pope than Mr. Crawley’s discussions with Vatican officials. 
Subject to Mr. Whitelaw’s views, 
there is considerable attraction in a fairly open statement of support by the Pope for the White Paper proposals; and he may be more willing to speak out if he can be persuaded that we have taken positive steps on internment.

Protestants in Northern Ireland would no doubt be critical of any comment made by the Pope: but the Pope’s support for the White Paper would be helpful with Catholics both North and South of the Border, especially at a time when Catholic support for the IRA appears to be declining. I have asked the Departments for urgent advice, so that 
if you decide to send a further message it will arrive in time to be taken into account in public statements the Pope will be making over Easter.

6 APRIL 1973 THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE TO THE POPE WAS DELIVERED ON 
THE AFTERNOON OF 20 MARCH ITSELF. APART FROM THE POINT RAISED AGAIN ABOUT INTERNMENT (MENTIONED FURTHER IN PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW) THE POPE’S REPLY SEEMS UNEXCEPTIONABLE. 
2. I HAVE DISCUSSED THE WHITE PAPER TWICE WITH ARCHBISHOP 
CASAROLE SINCE 20 MARCH. DELAY IN SENDING A REPLY HAS BEEN MAINLY DUE TO CAUTION ON THE PART OF THE POPE’S ADVISERS WHO WERE, PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY ENOUGH, MORE INTERESTED IN THE REACTIONS TO THE WHITE PAPER OF ALL PARTIES CONCERNED THAN IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PAPER ITSELF. THEY WERE ANXIOUS THAT THE POPE SHOULD NOT BE ADVISED TO LEND SUPPORT, EVEN IF PRIVATELY AND IN CONFIDENCE, TO AN INITIATIVE WHICH WAS GOING TO BE OPPOSED BY ANY MAIN SECTION OF OPINION OTHER THAN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS THEMSELVES. BEFORE COMPOSING A FIRST DRAFT OF THE POPE’S REPLY, THEY APPARENTLY SATISFIED THEMSELVES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN DUBLIN, AS WELL AS MODERATES ON BOTH SIDES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WERE, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN THE WHITE PAPER. 
3. AS SEEN FROM HERE, THE ONE RATHER DISAPPOINTING POINT RAISED 
ONCE MORE INTHE POPE’S REPLY IS HIS RENEWED PLEA FOR THE PRACTICE OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL TO BE ENDED, THIS WAS SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED AS PARAGRAPHS 58 TO 60 OF THE WHITE PAPER DEALT WITH THIS POINT AND WE HAD SENT THE VATICAN THE TEXT OF MR WHITELAW’S STATEMENT MADE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 20 DECEMBER LAST ON THE REPORT OF THE DIPLOCK COMMISSION. WE HAD ALSO SENT THE TEXT OF THE PRIME MINISTER’S SIMILAR STATEMENT ON 28 MARCH WHICH AGAIN DEALS WITH INTERNMENT. MOREOVER, THE PRIME MINISTER. HIMSELF HAD EXPLAINED TO THE POPE OUR DIFFICULTIES ABOUT INTERNMENT

DURING THEIR MEETING LAST OCTOBER, INFORMING HIM THAT, SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF DIRECT RULE, THE NUMBER OF INTERNEES HAD BEEN REDUCED FROM OVER 1,000 TO SOME 171 AND THAT MORE WOULD SOON BE RELEASED. AT THE OFFICIAL LEVEL I HAVE NOW COME OVER THE WHOLE GROUND AGAIN, AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE DO NOT NOW AT THIS STAGE GET INTO A FURTHER HIGH LEVEL ARGUMENT ABOUT INTERNEES. 
4. I UNDERSTAND THAT POPE PAUL HIMSELF MUCH APPRECIATED 
RECEIVING THE PRIME MINISTER’S PERSONAL MESSAGE AND THAT HE IS NOW ALSO PREPARED, I N THE CONTEXT OF PARAGRAPH 2 ABOVE, TO GIVE US SOME DEGREE OF INEI RECT SUPPORT IN PUBLIC. HE WAS HIMSELF CONSIDERING AT ONE TIME THAT HE MIGHT DECLARE HIS SUPPORT FOR THE WHITE PAPER MORE OR LESS IN SPECIFIC TERMS. HIS ADVISERS HOWEVER ARE OF THE VIEW (POSSIBLY RIGHTLY) THAT OPEN SUPPORT MIGHT ONLY RESULT IN ULSTER PROTESTANTS SUSPECTING THAT THE PAPER’S PROPOSALS WERE AFTER ALL SOMETHING OF A POPISH PLOT WEIGHTED AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERESTS, AND THAT THEREFORE ANY SUCH DECLARATION OF PAPAL SUPPORT MIGHT BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. THE POPE I S THEREFORE MORE LIKELY, THOUGH THIS IS STILL NOT FINALLY DECIDED, TO SPEAK MORE GENERALLY BUT ALSO MORE BRIEFLY, AND NO DOUBT IN LESS FORTHRIGHT TERMS, ALONG THE SORT OF LNES ADOPTED BY CARDINAL HEENAN IN HIS SERMON ON 18 MARCH AS REPORTED BY BBC TV NEWS-READER PETER WOODS. I UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE POPE SO DECIDES HE WILL PROBABLY CHOOSE AN OCCASION DURING L EASTER TO MAKE SOME SUCH PUBLIC REFERENCE.

Annex C to A/BR/30/8 Dated 25 June 1973 
0700 HRS SUNDAY 24 JUNE TO 0700 HRS MONDAY 25 JUNE 1973 BELFAST 1. 
/MO4 A quiet day with one shooting incident which did not involve SF and no 
bomb explosions. Patrick Cunningham, (40, Prot) was fatally shot when answering his door in the Protestant Old Park area. He is believed to have been a ’Lapsed Catholic’ and married to a Protestant. From 1400 hrs to 2300 hrs there were continual disturbances in the North of the few Lodge involving gangs of 10-40 youths. Some of the stoning was across the interlaces but most was directed against SF. Two youths were arrested for riotous behaviour and 23 baton rounds were fired. SF arrested 10 suspects including 3 known Provos and a UVF arms runner. 
LONDONDERRY 2. 
A quiet day in which there were no shooting incidents. 20 masked, uniformed 
but unarmed UDA men were seen marching in the Waterside. BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 3. 
There were 3 shooting incidents and a rocket attack all involving SF. A 
single rocket and 2 HV shots were fired at RUC Rosslea; the warhead detonated on the protective fence. No damage was done and there were no casualties. Outside Newtonhamilton a car was waved don by a patrol carrying out a snap VCP. The car did not stop avoided one soldier and failed to stop for the second soldier, who jumped clear. The second soldier fired one round into the car’s wheel. 
The ricohetfrom the shot grazed the bottom of one of the occupants. There were 3 bomb explosions. 
The car stopped and the 6 occupants were questioned by the RUC. A cylinder bomb, thrown from a car, damaged a Catholic 
owned shop in Ballyclare; a small bomb exploded without warning in a Catholic owned contractor’s yard in Dungannon, causin little damage and a 20-30 lb bomb damaged the Munster and Leinster Bank in Strabane. This was the second bomb attack on the bank in 10 days. There was a minor stoning incident inside HMP Maze between compounds 4 and 5 which was contained by the prison staff.

Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly (GEN 79(73) 16) 
In this report the Secretary of State briefly reviews the terrorist 
situation; comments on the results of the local elections; reflects on possible outcomes of the elections to the Assembly; and refers to the timetable of Northern Ireland legislation at present before Parliament. Terrorism 2. 
The IRA are considerably weakened but still capable of spasmodic 
violence. The Secretary of State will report on the recent increase in Protestant terrorist activity. You may wish to ask him whether this is likely to affect the chances of the one or two UDA men (e.g. Mr. Herron) who are standing in the Assembly elections, and whether Mr. Craig will be successful in preventing some of the obloquy from brushing off on his Party. The memorandum also refers to a campaign, already beginning, for the release of prisoners from the Maze. The Secretary of State is probably right in saying that "We cannot go on indefinitely increasing the number of people held". But what alternative does he suggest? And, more generally, does he see any real end to sectarian terrorism in the foreseeable future? If not, what are the chances that the new constitutional arrangements will even get off the ground? The Elections 3. 
The Secretary of State is surely right in warning his colleagues that 
the results of the local elections should not be taken as a reliable guide to the outcome of the elections to the Assembly. The recent JIC report on "The Irish Situation" (JIC(A)(73)(SA)(IR) 31 of 6th June) provides a very useful commentary on this subject. Perhaps its most significant sentence is the statement that "The vote as a whole, however, particularly among Protestants, demonstrated once again the defensive and sectarian nature of Northern Ireland politics". The Secretary of State may well be right, therefore, in predicting that, because many Protestant voters cast their second votes in favour of more extreme candidates, the Catholics (many of whom appear to have given their first vote to the Alliance Party, while many of those who voted for the SDLP did not give their second votes to Catholic extremists) may now follow the Protestant example and move outwards

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 010700 TO 040700 HRS JUNE 1973 GENERAL 1. 
Against a backgound of very fe shooting incidents (17 in which SF were 
involved in 10) and 6 explosions; the more serious events stand out in contrast and received perhapsdisproportionate interest in the press. 
Of greatest note were a succession of disturbances in the Creggan and the 
Bogside of Londonderry on Sunday. The worst of these followed the dispersal of a peaceful anti-internment meeting in Guildhall Square when a crowd stoned and attacked the Gasworks location. 
A man and a woman were killed when two gunmen burst into a Protestant house 
in the Bone area of Belfast on Saturday. No motive has yet appeared for these murders. There was a single RPG7 rocket attack on a fuel installation at Aldergrove airport on Sunday. The rocket was fired from the main road and exploded against the chain link fence without significant damage. 
Sgt Drake, the fifth’ of the senior NCO’s involved in the car bomb explosion 
at Omagh; died in hospital. There was a suicide in the Maze Prison on Sunday an event which may spark off 
further anti-internment propaganda.

0700 HRS SUNDAY 03 JUNE TO 0700 HRS MONDAY 04 JUNE 1973 BELFAST 1. 
SF were involved in all 3 shooting incidents; there were no casualties 
and no fire was returned. An explosion in the James Connolly Republican Club in the Falls Road caused extensive damage to the building, but no casualties as the club was empty. A mobile patrol was stoned in the Woodvale area by 75-100 youths and a soldier slightly injured. Included in the arrests was an officer in the auxiliary Provos. 
LONDONDERRY 
3. There was only 1 shooting incident but there were a number of incidents of hooliganism during the late afternoon and evening. The three Republican marches took place as planed converging on the Guildhall square from Brandywell, Creggan and Shantallov. 
The crowd was estimated at 1000 initially but soon 
dropped off to 400. The crowd dispersed peacefully after several speeches. After the meeting hooliganism began at the Gasworks SF location in the Bogside involving groups of up to 50 youths, some of whom attempted to tear down parts of the Army post with iron bars. An arrest operation was launched resulting in 3 arrests but the arrest party was attacked by women and attempts were made to grab weapons. A 2 yr old child was placed in the road to block the SF departure route. To buses were then hijacked but quickly recovered by SF. Stoning then began in the Creggan during which 2 petrol bombs were thrown. This was directed mainly against a patrol in the area of the Tesco VCP. 5 more arrests were made. During the day there were 5 minor military casualties. A store in the city was set on fire, possibly by a petrol bomb. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
There were no shooting incidents. There was a rocket attack on the civil fuel tanker park at Aldergrove Airport - the rocket exploded on hitting 
the chain link fence but the rocket motor assembly carried on embedding itself in the cab of a tanker. This incident is reported in detail at Appendix 1. In Newry the propellant section of a RPG rocket was found 
- it is thought that 
this may have been connected with an explosion heard in the area on Saturday night. Loyalist marches in Lurgan, Aughnacloy and Killylea passed off peacefully. At HMP Maze Patrick Crawford (RC 22) was found hanged - 
the incident is being treated as suicide.

7 July 1972 I am sorry not to have replied before to 
your letter of 30 June about paragraph 3 of Dublin telegram No. 448 on arrest policy. We see some danger in a sensitive and volatile situation of encouraging the close co-ordination referred to be too specific and I have ventured to recast the draft letter to John Peck. I hope you would agree that this would be the right line to take. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Stephens at the Ministry of Defence.

DRAFT LETTER TO SIR JOHN PECK KCMG, DUBLIN FROM SIR STEWART CRAWFORD 
Arrest Policy in Northern Ireland In paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 448 you reported 
that Mr. Lynch thought that the question of measures against Provisional IRA men caught in the South called for close coordination. We believe this should be played in a very low key and it would be better not to press Mr. Lynch on it. Our policy is that if a Provisional who is wanted for a criminal offence committed before the cease fire is recognised he is to be arrested; but that he is not to be searched out. No similar inhibitions exist over men wanted for crimes committed after the cease fire. One could argue that it would be right for the authorities not to put themselves out to catch and deal with Provisionals wanted by us for offences before the cease fire, on the ground that if the Republic makes the going too hot for them they may go North, where we do not particularly want them. But there are dangers in being too specific about this, for 2 reasons. First if the Republic are to back pedal they will want a list of names, which will almost certainly leak somewhere and it would be a matter for the gravest embarrassment if it appeared that there was any sort of deal over these people. Secondly, in a volatile situation, who knows but that a time may come when we want the maximum pressure put on the IRA

30 June, 1972. ARREST POLICY IN NORTHERN IRELAND You will have seen in telegram No. 448 from Dublin, 
reporting John Peck’s talk with Mr. Lynch on 23 June, his explanation in paragraph 3 about arrest policy following the ceasefire in Northern Ireland. In the light of what Mr. Whitelaw said in the GEN 79 last night, it may be that John Peck has not got the picture quite right, and I feel that we ought to make it as clear as we can. I enclose the draft of a letter I should like to send him if it is an accurate picture of our intentions. Would you kindly let me know by telephone if it is all right.

QUESTIONS FOR WRITTEN ANSWER ON TUESDAY 27 JUNE 1972 
Mr Stallard ( St.Pancras, North) : To ask the Secretary of state for Northern Ireland, when he expects to be able to make a report on the progress of the review of the Northern Ireland Special Powers Act; and if be will make a statement. 
Mr Stallard (St.Pancras, North): To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when the Special Powers Act was last renewed; what is the normal procedure for its renewal; and if he will make a statement on this matter. 
DRAFT REPLY The Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act 
(Northern Ireland) 1922 was renewed annually by the Northern Ireland Parliament until 1928 when it was renewed for a period of five years. The Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1933 provided that the 1922 Act should remain in force until Parliament otherwise determined, and it has remained in force ever since. I have announced that I an reviewing the Act and the Regulations made under it. The review is under way and I will report to the House on its progress as such as I can.

BACKGROUND NOTE S. of S. undertook, during the passage of the Northern Ireland (Temporary 
Provisions) Bill to review the Special Powers Act and Regulations. Can 4 May, 
in a Written Answer to a Question from Mr Paul Rose, Mr Howell, referring to this undertaking, said that the review had begun but it was too early to present any conclusions to the House. Officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs have attended a meeting in London 
In the light of whose conclusions a draft submission setting out the possible choices is being prepared. But it will then be necessary to seek the views of the police and the Army, both of whom may be expected to hold strong views.

Secretary of State 1. 
This minute is for the record. At about 5.30 p.m. on Monday 26 June you 
saw the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Cairncross, the Civil Adviser to the GOC, Mr MDowall and myself. 2. 
You approved a new paragraph 9, with two sub-paragraphs, which is attached, 
to be inserted in the Army staff document "Security Forces Reactions to a Ceasefire". (This is the document which General Ford asked me last Wednesday to process through JSC(0) and submit to you. This was done, and a revised paragraph 9 was telexed to Northern Ireland.) The attached redraft is a clarification of the preceding instructions. 3. 
I explained that under sub-paragraph (ii) the persons affected would be those 
against whom there was already an arrest warrant, or sufficient evidence to charge the person on arrest with a crime; but it did not cover persons for whom there was neither evidence for a charge nor a warrant for arrest. I explained that the word "recognised" meant that the person would have to be seen and recognised as coming into the category above. 4. 
You approved the redrafted paragraph in the form it is attached, which 
incorporates the change of wording you asked for in the last sentence of (ii). 5. 
You agreed that these instructions should take effect from midnight tonight, 
and be subject to cancellation or variation by you in the event of a ceasefire not being achieved or sufficiently achieved. 6. 
You agreed that it should be at the discretion of the Army Commander and the 
Deputy Chief Constable how far down the line these instructions should be given in written form, but that it should be made clear that the instructions were an official secret and not for communication to unauthorised persons. 7. 
The revised instructions as attached would enable Mr McDowall to deny the rumour which has been widely publicised in the press that you had annulled or

"Arrest policy after the ceasefire should be as follows: (i) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed after these instructions take effect, the due processes of the law will apply, including those under the Special Powers Act. 
(ii) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and if there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances. In regard to matters arising before the ceasefire, persons may, if recognised, be arrested for the purpose of questioning leading to the preferment of charges, but not for purposes leading to internment."

cc Mr Cairncross Mr Woodfield 
Secretary of State 1. 
We have looked at the instructions to the Security Forces in regard to their 
conduct during a ceasefire. 2. 
It is our agreed view (NIO, Army, RUC) that the following passage should be 
inserted at paragraph 9 of the Army document "Security Forces Reactions to a Ceasefire" originating from CLF last Wednesday, which is intended to serve as a basis of more detailed instructions. 3. 
This passage is drafted on the simple basis that there is to be no 
"harassment" in respect of offences committed before the ceasefire, unless the offender "flaunts" himself: but that offences committed after the ceasefire are open to "harassment" under both the ordinary criminal law and the Special Powers Act so long as the Special Powers Act is not repealed. 4. 
The passage should be as follows: "Arrest policy after the ceasefire should be as follows: (i) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed after these instructions take effect, the due processes of the law will apply, including those under the Special Powers Act. 
(ii) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and if there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances. No person will be arrested simply for the purpose of interrogation and/or detention leading to internment in regard to matters arising before the ceasefire."

SECURITY FORCES ACTIONS TO A CEASEFIRE Introduction 1. 
The possibility exists that the Provisional IRA say either announce a 
ceasefire or simply allow one to come about. In either event a quick response from the Security Forces may be called for and our possible reactions should be examined, 
2. The aim of this short paper is to suggest the principles to be adopted 
by the Security Forces in the event of a ceasefire. Assumptions 3. 
The following assumptions are made: 
(a) There will be an immediate political requirement to demonstrate a still greater reduction of military activity, particularly in Catholic areas. 
(b) An IRA ceasefire is likely to be obeyed by the membership. There might however be individual acts of violence. 
(c) Hooliganism and possibly otuer sectarian demonstrations may continue In the initial stages at least, but on a reduced scale. 
(d) It will remain the role of the Security Forces to restore and maintain law and order, but more emphasis Pill devolve on the latter (see para. 8). 
After the initial ceasefire, decisions on the following subjects may 
be necessary: (a) Release of remaining internees. (b) Surrender of weapons. (c) The banning of all parades in uniform (IRA and UDA). (d) Reinstatement of civil police action. (e) Withdrawal to barracks". (f) Use of the Special Powers Act. 
5. It is assumed that Security Force action in response to agreement on 
these and many other subjects will be decided at a later stage. Role of the RUC 6. 
Every opportunity given by a ceasefire for the RUC to return to them proper primary role in the enforcement of law and order should be taken.

Principles to be Adopted by the Security Forces 7. 
all military patrol activity is to be reduced as much as possible consistent with 3(d) above. In the sensitive areas, combined RMP/RUC patrols are to be instituted wherever possible so as to keep open main routes (in Belfast these are marked white on the revised communities Map). 
8. Protection of the Interface. These are to be controlled by the 
Security Forces to prevent sectarian violence. 9. 
Arrest Policy. Arrest policy during the period of a ceasefire should be 
(a) As regards offences of all kinds committed after the ceasefire, arrests will be made as necessary within the ambit of the normal criminal law - i.e. persona will not be arrested for the purpose of questioning, detention or internment under the Special Powers Act. Legal advice is being obtained on the powers of the Army to arrest. 
(b) The problem of outstanding offences of a terrorist character committed by IRA men who have evaded arrest or skipped bail will require a separate decision. 
(c) A further question which will have to be decided at once is whether any regulations creating criminal offences under the Special Powers Act should be suspended or repealed. 
10. Searches of buildings and property are to be confined to those in pursuit 
of investigation of criminal activities committed after the ceasefire. VCPs will, subject to paragraph 3(d), be progressively withdrawn except at entrances to military bases and at key points and other patented premises. 
11. Altering the Military posture. Other measures that can be taken, as 
circumstances allow, to progressively demonstrate a change in military posture are: 
(a) Vehicle patrols to use Landrovers instead of Pigs as soon as it is judged safe to do so. 
(b) Weapons are to be available but not "at the ready" when on vehicle patrol. 
(c) Flack jackets and helmets where appropriate are to be readily available but not worn. 
(d) Improving the appearance of military bases, particularly in central Belfast. 
Border Policy. All cratering and recrataring activity to cease. No patrols to approach within one mile of the border except on Brigade authority. 
12. Patrolling. With the general exception of major roads and interfaces

The following practice over arrests should be followed 
with immediate effect:1. 
No person will be arrested simply for the purpose of interrogation, detention or internment under Regulations 10 - 12 of the Special Powers Regulations. 
2. 
In respect of offences under the criminal law, where the offence is alleged to have been committed after these instructions take effect, the ordinary processes of the criminal law will apply. 
3. 
In respect of offences under the criminal law, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances.

"Arrest Policy", you touched upon problems that might arise following a truce. 
In your letter to Jack Howard-Drake of 9 June, about We have already discussed this aspect 
briefly and, without wishing to confuse the present debate on "Arrest Policy", I think it worthwhile trying to clear our minds now on the further problems that might arise upon a truce. 
2. If I understand the position correctly, it is generally 
held that, were the IRA to call a truce, it would be politically dangerous to "lift" known IRA leaders as their safe havens became open to normal police and Army activity. 
in effect, be an amnesty for those IRA men who had managed to evade capture until the date of the truce and who, if they had been captured, could only have been detained or interned under the Special Powers Act, since there was insufficient evidence against them to bring a criminal charge. 
3. But there are two further categories of IRA men. The second category is more difficult; First, 
those against whom there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge, but against whom no warrant has yet been issued. Presumably it is possible to arrange that such men are not charged. 
there 
must be many IRA men,often now taking refuge in the Republic, against whom warrants have been issued. 
If these warrants 
were to be withdrawn you would presumably bring down upon your head immediate calls for the "amnesty" to be extended to all those "political prisoners" who were unlucky enough to be caught and convicted on similar charges before the truce. No doubt you will hear that call anyway with increasing stridency in coming months; 
what I am now concerned with, 
however, is that we should not incur charges of bad faith, with all the attendant political problems, if we continue to arrest certain offenders even after the truce. 
This problem 
has, of course, a wider application than the particular FCO interest, but it was nonetheless a point that was put to me in Dublin recently, and I suspect the Irish Government is every bit as anxious as we are to maintain Mr Whitelaw’s good name for straight dealing in any immediate post-truce period. 
4. It therefore occurred to me that (at the time of any truce) 
it might be desirable for a public announcement to be made that warrants have been issued and will still be executed against 
So there would,

(We would then give the names This public statement 
would conclude by saying, in the appropriate legal language, that the DPP had examined all the files relating to offences committed during the late troubles, and had concluded that the evidence available was insufficient to warrant proceedings, against anyone "save those listed above", and that the RUC had therefore closed all other files.

could not possibly be

is to avoid future accusations of bad faith. 6.

4 January 1973 
J T Williams Esq Northern Ireland Office Great George Street London SW1 
Arrest Policy: Protestants Two important decisions have been taken here at Stormont Castle in the last two days. 
2. At the morning meeting on 2 January the Secretary of State expressed anxiety to take some visible effective action to deal with the assassinations. The Chief Constable suggested that if it happened that Protestant extremists suspected of murder or other terrorist crime had to be let go after interrogation by the CID they should be re-arrested under Regulation 11 and interrogated by the Special Branch. The Secretary of State agreed that this should happen and said that if the Special Branch interrogation pointed to the preparation of submissions for interim custody orders he would be quite prepared for this. In principle there is nothing new in this, since the Secretary of State has always said that he would be prepared to detain some Protestant extremists if a proper case were made out. The new element is that some orders for the custody of Protestants are likely now soon to be made. 
3. 
and as not in itself constituting any formal change of arrest policy, since any interim custody orders would be incidental to action taken 
The Secretary of State evidently regarded this decision as a first step against 
suspected murderers and terrorists. He preferred this step to another suggestion, made by the GOC, that the RUC should re-examine, with a view to the making of custody orders, the list of the 50 or so men apprehended and released at the drinking club in the Shankill on the famous night when Gusty Spence, along with the greater part of the command structure of the UVF, was alleged to have slipped through the fingers of the security forces. 
4. The Secretary of State said that he would also look again at the five 
specimen cases recently submitted to him of Protestant extremists who might be made the subject of interim custody orders. What he had in mind was that if it were possible to put two or three bad men inside as a result of investigations into their being suspected of murder or other terrorist crime he might at the same time make orders on another two or three Protestant extremists on the basis of information about their activities not necessarily related to specific criminal incidents. These latter two or three might be from the five specimen cases. He has since looked at these specimen cases and decided that there would be good grounds for making custody orders in at least two cases. (It does not follow that orders will in fact be made.) 
5. The second decision was taken at the morning meeting on 3 January, when 
arrest policy was formally considered on the basis of Army papers 113G of 9 December and 12 December. The decision was that the present arrest instructions are amended with immediate effect by the introduction of a

J T Williams Esq 4 January 1973 new sub-paragraph as follows. 
"Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, end for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order." 
These words are to be inserted as a new paragraph (e), so that the arrest instructions will now read from (a) to (f) as in the annex to this letter. 
6. This annex reproduces the relevant part of Annex B to HQNI document 
1104G of 7 December 1972, which is the Commander Land Forces’ Directive for Future Operations. This is an important document, which we should obtain for our files, if we have not got it already. (I had not myself previously seen it.) The arrest instructions as embodied in Annex B to document 1104G, ie even before this latest amendment, are I think slightly different from the latest version known to us in the NIO in London; paragraph (b) has an extra sentence. The purpose of the new paragraph (e) is to make it possible to proceed against Protestant terrorists. There is, of course, no intention of announcing that there is a new arrest policy or an arrest policy in relation to Protestants. Indeed the Chief Constable was most anxious that only a very limited distribution should be given to the new instruction. He will himself inform only a very small number of people in the RUC and the GOC said that the Army would likewise limit distribution. It is possible thus to restrict the circulation of the formal instruction and nevertheless to act on it because of the words "on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment". This means that the security forces will only proceed under this paragraph against named terrorists and with the approval of the Secretary of State or one of the other Ministers. It was stated quite unequivocally at the meeting that it is intended to proceed under this paragraph only with the approval of a Minister in each case. 
7. I do m t know how much of the foregoing will be reflected in the minutes 
of the meetings; but it is clearly desirable that we should be fully informed about it in London, because of our share of the responsibility in relation to policy on arrest and detention and so that we can keep our end up in relations with the Ministry of Defence on these issues. 
8. Copies of this letter are being left behind here for Jack Howard-rake 
and for the files here; but I am not sending a copy to anyone outside the Northern Ireland Office. The Ministry of Defence will no doubt hear about all this on their own net.

1. SECURITY REVIEW The GOC and Chief Constable reported a generally quiet 24-hour period. 
The Secretary of State agreed to the establishment of a joint RMP/RUC Task Force in Londonderry on the lines of that already operating in Belfast. 
To counter allegations of lack of activity on the part of the security forces in relation to recent murders in Belfast it was decided that the Information Service might release news about the establishment of a separate control room for the Task Force in Belfast. 
Arising out of a discussion about the interpretation of the word "illegal", Lord Windlesham asked Mr Harris and Mr Macmahon to co-operate in producing a short brief on the application of the term to organisations and their uniforms. 
2. ARREST POLICY (Resumed Discussion) 
The meeting had before it HQNI Paper 1113G of 12 December, para 7(e) of which would have been modified by the decision taken at the Secretary of State’s meeting of 13 December (SSM (72) 118 Item 2). 
The GOC said that subsequent discussions between his HQ and NIO Belfast had revealed that the proposed modification would have introduced unforeseen difficulties. After further discussion it was agreed that the sub-paragraph should read as follows:"Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order." 
The meeting noted that the Army Paper was intended for limited distribution and took the view that no suggestion should be made in any quarter of any fundamental change being made in arrest policy.

Sir William Nield It was agreed at the Secretary of State’s morning meeting on Wednesday 
13th December that I should discuss further with the Army the exact wording of paragraphs 7(b) and 7(e) in the attached document. 2. 
On sneaking to the Chief of Staff I was surprised to find that there was 
still uncertainty in the Army about whether they wanted the new paragraph 7(e), as amended at the Secretary of State’s meeting, to be circulated now or to be held in reserve. They have discussed this among themselves and at the request of the RUC have come up with the slightly odd idea that the paragraph should not be circulated until, as they put it, "the dossiers are available". I do not understand what the relevance is of this but for the moment have merely agreed with the Chief of Staff that we will talk again about it when the dossiers are in fact available. The subject will no doubt come up when the "test case" is considered next week. 3. 
The Army would prefer to make a further amendment to the amendment which 
you proposed at the meeting and they now wish paragraph 7(e) to read as follows: "Other terrorists who are known on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order. The persons and categories to whom this applies will be specified from time to time." 
4. 5. I see no objection to this. I discussed further with the Chief of Staff the second sentence of 
paragraph 7(b). He explained that it had been included in the revised CLF directive on the grounds it reflected the instructions in the Secretary of State’s letter of 6th November in which he said: "In view of recent developments, Protestant terrorists may fall to be dealt with under the new order. It is not possible at the moment to define the categories which I will be prepared to consider for interim custody and for the time being I will consider applications in respect of them on their merits."

6. I think this is fair enough and is in fact quite useful since it covers 
the point the Secretary of State has made that he would be prepared to consider signing interim custody orders against any Protestants who were arrested on the basis of their possible implication in murder but against whom it was not possible to prefer charges.

NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS Reference: A. 
1113 G dated 9th December 1972. 
1. At the meeting at Stormont Castle on 1lth December, the GOC tabled a paper on Arrest Policy for Protestants, proposing a form of words to be incorporated in the Army’s arrest instructions in the event of a decision to widen tho arrest policy in respect of Protestant terrorists. Discussion was adjurned so that a further paper could be prepared showing where the additional form of words would fit into the existing arrest instructions. 
2. Attached is the relevant extract from the arrest instructions, 
corresponding to pages 1 - 2 of Annex B to CLF’s Directive 1104 G dated 7th December (of which the Northern Ireland Office has copies), but with an additional arrest category inserted as a new sub-paragraph 7 e. (sidelined). This sub-paragraph is not included in the current Directive. The words in square brackets would be included or not, depending upon whether it was desirable at the time to single out specific categories of terrorists, for example by naming certain organisations but not others.

ARREST POLICY (Paper by GOC) INTRODUCTION 1. 
This instruction is written in an effort to summarise the many letters 
and signals put out over the months on arrests,and to show how the soldier can use his powers of arrests in Northern Ireland in simple terms. A full instruction on this subject will shortly be promulgated and the present instruction provides guidance in the meantime on the main points. 
2. A soldier has the general powers of arrest enjoyed by every citizen under statute and common law. In addition the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 (referred to as the Special Powers Act or SPA) confers further powers of arrest on soldiers on duty. 
TYPES OF ARREST Red Handed Arrests 3. 
These are normally made under the general "citizen" powers where a 
soldier sees a person commit, or suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has just committed a breach of the peace or serious offence, e.g. assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon. The soldier must tell the person in question why he is arresting him in the simplest possible terms, but he must include the word "arrest". 
Example ’A’. When a stone thrower is snatched, the arresting soldier could say "You’re under arrest for riotous behavious" or more simply "You’re under arrest for throwing stones". 
Example ’B’. Where a person is searched and a weapon is found upon him the words could be "I am arresting you for the unlawful possession of a firearm". 
Planned Arrests 4. 
These are normally made under the SPA powers. The degree of planning 
can vary between may days and a few minutes but it is most important that the formula on the Blue Card is used in every case; and it is as well to nominate the soldier who is to carry out the actual arrest and if possible to practise what he is to say beforehand. There is no reason why he should not read the arrest formula from his Blue Card whilst making the arrest. 
5. are:- 
Regulation 10 Regulation 11 
6. - - 
for interrogation on suspicion 
Regulation 10. For the time being this Regulation is NOT to be used. 
When in use it applies only to the situation in which the RUC wish to interrogate a person and are using troops as their agents to effect the arrest. The authorisation to carry out the arrest must come from an officer of the RUC of the rank of Superintendent or above and should be in writing. The formula at paragraph 4 of the Blue Card must be used. 
The two Regulations from the SPA which are used for planned arrests

7. Regulation 11. This is chiefly used when a person is suspected of 
having committed an offence in the field of law and order but there is a brook in time between the alleged commission of the offence and the apprehension of the suspect. The appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card must be used. Additionally persons in the following categories are to be arrested under Regulation 11 powers:- 
a. Anyone against hom there is known to be evidence to 
justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which 
might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged 
consideration will be given to 
a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient 
c. Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional 
IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. d. 
intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. 
e. Other terrorists who are known, on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, 
Interim Custody Order. f. 
Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red-handed" 
(see paragraph 3 above) if the arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial to peace. 
8. Soldiers may wish to question a passer-by, e.g. as to his identity 
and recent activities, even though his behaviour gives no grounds for suspicion. This is permissible if it is done on the spot or very close by and the questions are reasonable. There is no power to require a person to leave the immediate area and go to a military post for this questioning unless he is lawfully arrested. If an answer is given which causes the soldier to suspect the person of falling into one of the categories in paragraph 7 above, he should arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA, remembering to use the appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card. If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately. If however the passer-by refuses to stop or to answer the questions he is committing an offence against the SPA Regulations and the soldier can arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA on that ground.

ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS Reference:A. 
1. 1113 G dated 9th December 1972. At the meeting at Stormont Castle on 11th December, the GOC tabled 
a paper on Arrest Policy for Protestants, proposing a form of words to be incorporated in the Army’s arrest instructions in the event of a decision to widen the arrest policy in respect of Protestant terrorists. Discussion was adjurned so that a further paper could be prepared showing where the additional form of words would fit into the existing arrest instructions. 
2. 
Attached is the relevant extract from the arrest instructions, corresponding to pages 1 - 2 of Annex B to CLF’s Directive 1104 G dated 
7th December (of which the Northern Ireland Office has copies), but with an additional arrest category inserted as a new sub-paragraph 7 e. (sidelined). This sub-paragraph is not included in the current Directive. The words in square brackets would be included or not, depending upon whether it was desirable at the time to single out specific categories of terrorists, for example by naming certain organisations but not others.

ARREST POLICY (Paper by GOC) 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
and signals put out over the months on arrests, and to show how the soldier can use his powers of arrests in Northern Ireland in simple terms. A full instruction on this subject will shortly be promulgated and the present instruction provides guidance in the meantime on the main points. 
This instruction is written in an effort to summarise the many letters 
2. A soldier has the general powers of arrest enjoyed by every citizen under statute and common law. In addition the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 (referred to as the Special Powers Act or SPA) confers further powers of arrest on soldiers on duty. 
TYPES OF ARREST ed Handed Arrests 
3. These are normally made under the general "citizen" powers where a 
soldier sees a person commit, or suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has just committed a breach of the peace or serious offence, e.g. assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon. The soldier must tell the person in question why he is arresting him in the simplest possible terms, but he must include the word "arrest". 
Example ’A’. When a stone thrower is snatched, the arresting soldier could say "You’re under arrest for riotous behavious" or more simply "You’re under arrest for throwing stones". 
Example ’B’. Where a person is searched and a weapon is found upon him the words could be "I am arresting you for the unlawful possession of a firearm". 
Planned Arrests 4. 
These are normally made under the SPA powers. The degree of planning 
can vary between may days and a few minutes but it is most important that the formula on the Blue Card is used in every case; and it is as well to nominate the soldier who is to carry out the actual arrest and if possible to practise what he is to say beforehand. There is no reason why he should not read the arrest formula from his Blue Card whilst making the arrest.

Regulation 10. For the time being this Regulation is NOT to be used. n u it applies only to the situation in which the RUC wish to person and are using troops as their agents to effect the thorisation to carry out the arrest must come from an officer

having committed an offence in the field of law nd order but there is a break in time between the alleged commission of the offence and the apprehension of the suspect. The appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card must be used. Additionally persons in the following categories are to be arrested under Regulation 11 powers:- 
Regulation 11. This is chiefly used when a person is suspected of a. Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to 
justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which 
might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. [If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged, then irrespective of whether he is a member of the Provisional IRA, consideration will be given to a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient.] 
c. Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional 
IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. d. 
Provisional IRA Volunteers, who, on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. 
e. Other terrorists who are known, on the h of 
intelligence to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for Interim Custody Order. 
f. Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red-handed" 
(see paragraph 3 above) if the arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial to peace. 
8. Soldiers may wish to question a passer-by, e.g. as to his identity 
and recent activities, even though his behaviour gives no grounds for suspicion. This is permissible if it is done on the spot or very close by and the questions are reasonable. There is no power to require a person to leave the immediate area and go to a military post for this questioning unless he is lawfully arrested. If an answer is given which causes the soldier to suspect the person of falling into one of the categories in paragraph 7 above, he should arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA, remembering to use the appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card. If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately. If however the passer-by refuses to stop or to answer the questions he is committing an offence against the SPA Regulations and the soldier can arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA on that ground.

ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS (PAPER BY COC) 1. 
a. 
are to arrest, in addition to persons caught red-handed in the act of committing an offence, persons in the following categories:- 
The Army’s present arrest instructions provide that soldiers Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence 
to justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
c. d. e. Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence 
which might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. 
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the 
Provisional IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. 
Provisional IRA volunteers who, on the strength of 
reliable intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. 
Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red- 
handed" if th arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudical to peace. 
2. From this it will be seen that arrests are linked to the prospect of bringing criminal charges, except in the case of categories c. and d. - 
ie. Provisional officers and certain 
volunteers. 3. 
The policy does not therefore provide for the arrest of 
Protestants or other non-Provisional terrorists except with the object of bringing a criminal charge. Protestants are not, as the policy stands, arrested with a view to their being made subject to Interim Custody Orders (ICOs) and brought before the Commissioners. The Secretary of State has indicated that in individual cases he will be prepared to consider on their merits applications for Interim Custody Orders in respect of Protestants, but such applications for Protestants will only arise where a person who at the time of arrest is thought to be criminally chargeable turns out during questioning not to be chargeable. 
4. Ministers have judged that the time is not at the moment 
ripe for an extension of the arrest policy in respect of Protestants. The object of this note is however to suggest a form of words which can be incorporated in the Arrest Policy Instructions when the time comes for such an extension. 
5. 
is very difficult to lay down precise criteria to define those Protestant terrorists who should be arrested. With the 
It 
exception of the UVF, Protestant extremist organisations are not in themselves illegal; it is not therefore possible to regard all those holding certain defined positions in Protestant organisations

as dangerous terrorists, as we regard officers in the Provisional IRA. 
6. It is suggested, therefore, that a category defined along the following li 
to be arrested:- 
"Other terrorists (as specified from time to time by the Secretary of State) who are known, on the strength of reliable intelligence to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order." 
7. Minor amendments to categories e and d would be required 
if, as the result of an end to the Official IRA’s ceasefire, Official IRA members were once again arrested with a view to detention. 
8. It could be argued that the UVF, which like the IRA is an 
illegal organisation, should be singled out for special treatment. To possibilities are:- 
a. To provide that all members of the UVF are to be arrested. 
b. 9. To provide that persons holding officer positions in the UVF are to be arrested. 
of all members of the Provisional IRA, and it would be illogical to go further in the case of the UVF than we do in the case of the IRA. The arrest of officers in the UVF is a more realistic option; but it is doubtful whether the intelligence available in their cases is sufficient to support applications for Interim Custody Orders, or subsequent Detention Orders by the Commissioners, except of course where a UVF officer falls anyway within the category defined in paragraph 8 above. 
The present arrest policy does not provide for the arrest 
10. The arrest instructions will, in any case, require overhaul when the awaited improvements are introduced to the law on membership of illegal organisations in order to remove the present difficulties in securing convictions. In practice, the references to "criminal offences" in the present arrest instructions have not been taken to include membership of an illegal organisation; otherwise the Army would be bound to arrest all members of the IRA (Official as well as Provisional), UVF, etc. Even if the law is amended effectively, there ill be strong reasons on practical as well as political grounds for not arresting everyone who commits the offence of membership of an illegal organisations; presumably members of the Official IRA will be excluded.

12. Although this hirective aUr:rtncrea’;ng tnInthe Sonths ahead, it is essential that the Province should not erupt and that the White Paper is presented in the best possible olimate, 
We aust ensure that the extremists on both sides are 
isolated so that the great bulk of moderate opinion will prevail. The publication of the White Paper will be a vital step in IIGts ffoi towards the political solution, and it is our military task to ensure that it is launched on a public who are in the most suitable mood and circumstances to receive it. 
13. The IRA remain the root cause of the security problem so that our actions must be primarily directed towards their defeat. 
Our actions are, however, to be carefully balanced 
so that no unnecessary irritation is caused to the bulk of the law-abiding Catholic population. 
14. Serious attrition of the IRA will, to a large extent, out the militant ground from under the extreme Protestants so that political progress can more easily take place. 
15, The task of law and order enforcement is ultimately for the police rather than the Army, 
The Army, in the closest 
support of the police, must therefore aim to reduce the extent of intimidation exercised by extremist organisations and so encourage reconciliation between the communities. 
This in 
turn will allow political progress so that, in due course, the situation will be restored and the police will no longer require the permanent support of the Regular British Army.

Attitudes and Discipline 
(1) The conduct of the Army continues to be a factor of great importance in the task of depriving extremist elements of the support of the majority of the moderate population, thus leading to a reconciliation between the communities which will in turn allow unhindered political progress. 
The Army must be seen to be 
courteous well turned out and well behaved, and to obey the laws of the land in such matters as traffic discipline including speed limits and lighting regulations. 
Army vehicles are distinctive and 
plentiful so that any breach of the law is quickly noticed. 
(2) In addition, the Army’s impartiality between religious denominations must be absolute and our attentions directed at law-breakers of whatever religion. 
In executing our task, the minimum force necessary must be the guiding rule. 
(3) Guidance on 
the use of firearms continues to be given in the Yellow Card.

as possible. As at present it will help me in considering each application 
if it is accompanied by a factual statement of the 
reasons why a detention order is considered necessary, indicating inter alia the extent to which the individual concerned is currently actively engaged in terrorist activity and the possibility of criminal charges being preferred. The practice whereby special Branch officers are available to explain the background of each case should continue, and it may be helpful on occasion if an Ary representative is also available to discuss the case. To this end a copy or the Special Branch submission should be sent to Headquarters Northern Ireland. 
You will know that it is my intention to seek the agreement of my colleagues to new procedures which in the event or internment being brought at an end will make It possible to keep in custody those members of the IRA whose continued liberty is a threat to security. The arrangements which I describe above are therefore on interim measure pending further consideration of alternative procedures and amI 
accordingly anxious that there should be no sudden large-scale increase in the number of detention orders. 
I hope therefore that 
thee will be kept to the minimum compatible with the needs of the security situation. 
This letter should be read in conjunction with the documents on 
arrest policy and on interrogation which Howard-Drake sent you with his letter of 16 August. I am sending a copy of this to Graham Shillington.

c.c. Mr Woodfield Mr Cairncross 
Sir William Nield I attended a meeting on 25th July at which the Attorney General 
with representatives of the Army, the RUC and others proposals which the Army have been putting forward for strengthening certain of their powers under the Special Powers Act and in particular for clarifying their powers of arrest and interrogation. 2. 
The discussion was confined to the latter and was not related to any 
particular scale of operations. We did not get on to the other questions of which we had had advance notice, such as curfews and stopping individuals and vehicles crossing the border; nor was there any discussion of indemnity. 3. 
It was disturbing to discover that even at this stage there is a good 
deal of confusion about the Army’s powers of arrest and interrogation and there still seems to be a large differing of legal views on the subject. The meeting eventually agreed that revised draft regulations - not incorporating any substantial changes - should be prepared in an attempt to clarify the position. The Army and the RUC are to produce a draft which can be looked at from both the legal and political angles. 4. 
In the course of a lengthy discussion it emerged that the Army must make 
a large proportion of their arrests under Regulation 11 (detention) rather than under Regulation 10 under which a man can be held for interrogation for 48 hours. 5. 
Up to now it has been understood that a man arrested under Regulation 11 
could be held legally for only 24 hours before being charged, released or having a detention order made against him. A legal judgement made some little time ago has called this into question and the Attorney General considered that there was/ no legal limit on the time which a man could be held under Regulation 11 before he was charged, released or detained. He also took the view that a man so held could be questioned 
in doubt. Mr Johnston was anxious to preserve a distinction between - a point which has apparently been

In my judgement five days is too long and would not be pelitIoally defensible. On the other hand three days would be the e4uivalent of the period of 48 hours under Regulation 10 plus the former 24 uiri

and I have prepared the attached draft submission. I had a word with the Atterney Oenoral after the meeting who told me that he thought the bid for five days foam tarealistio but that three days would not be unreasonable.

Secretary of state The meeting which the Attorney General held on 25th July to 
consider proposals by the Army for extending their powers under the Special Powers Act turned out to be little more than a mainly legal discussion of their existing powers of arrest and interrogation. A particular point emerged on which instructions are required. 2. 
The broad pattern of arrest and questioning in the past has 
been for suspects to be arrested under Regulation 10 and interrogated for 48 hours. Some have then been re-arrested under 
Regulation 11 and it has been understood that they then had to be charged, released or 
The legal view now being taken is that there is no limit on the period under which a man can be held 
under 
Regulation 11 without a detention order but There are obvious political objections to making th 
period very long. 3. A substantial proportion of the arrests made by the Army 
in future operations will be under Regulation 11. This means that unless there is some extension of the limited period previously thought to be available for questioning under Regulation 11 interrogation will be restricted to 24 hours. Any extension can be made by administrative decision. 4. 
cases to be extended to five day 
The Army and the RUC are pressing for the period in some Questioning 
under the Judges Rules. Although the Attorney General made it abundantly clear that questioning must nevertheless 
be lawful,interrogation or a period of five days would give rise and 
to a good deal of suspicion/to many allegations of brutality, particularly as suspects will be held incommunicado. But a 
within 24 hours of being so arrested.

period of three days would be no longer than the period for which men have been held in the past under a combination of Regulation 10 and Regulation 11. 
It is suggested therefore that you should 
agree that suspects arrested under Regulation 11 may now be held for questioning for up to 72 hours before being charged, released or made the subject of a detention order. Where arrests are made under Regulation 10 in the first instance the total period should still not exceed 72 hours. 5. 
The Attorney General would support this proposal.

Mr Howard-Drake Wanted List It is interesting to note that category III of the wanted list, which 
is defined by the RUC as: "Those holding key positions in terrorist organisations who are known to be responsible for the direction and performance of acts of violence by others, but against whom there is no evidence or intelligence of personal involvement" contains only 31 names. The Secretary of State’s warnings about the difficulties of further 
large scale internment and detention have clearly been taken to heart and as a result the list seems to have been carefully sifted to include only key figures. The list contains 11 Official IRA and presumably their inclusion will have to be reviewed if that organisation decides to continue its ceasefire. Category III contains no Protestant extremists.

Mr Jack We spoke about the attached documents and, in particular, the 
Army’s interpretation of our instructions on arrest policy set out in their letter of 28 June which Sir William Nield asked me to look at. 
There are two points which worry me. These are: 
(a) Paragraph (b) of the Army letter envisages that persons may be arrested under Regulation 10 "for purposes of questioning prior to preferment of criminal charges". I am uncertain whether an arrest for such purposes would properly be within the powers conferred by Regulation 10. When we redrafted the main policy document, our main object was to preserve the powers of arrest under Regulation 11(1); these powers contemplate that persons so arrested could, in certain circumstances, be brought before the courts and the powers of arrest relate to any person whom the arresting officer "suspects of acting or of having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenace of order" and so on. To my mind, there is no doubt that the Army could arrest a person under these powers for the purpose of bringing that person before the courts. I am less sure about Regulation 10 where the arrest must specifically be for "interrogation". Further, the Lord Chief Justice has made i clear that the courts are unlikely to regard as admissable in criminal proceedings statements made by persons arrested and interrogated under Regulation 10. I do not know what is said in the Blue Card but I wonder whether it would not be better to miss out (b) altogether since the Army will have more than enough powers of arrest under Regulation 11 and no question of proceedings for wrongful arrest could arise in the exercise of those powers if the person was subsequently brought before the courts. If, however, for presentational reasons, the Army wish to keep a reference to Regulation 10, it would be better to refer to it in paragraph (c); but the words used by the arresting officer should nevertheless refer to Regulation 10 and 11. 
(b) 
I am not altogether happy about the wording of paragraph (c) in the Army letter. It says that arrests are to be made "in respect of conduct and not simply membership of an illegal organisation". The reference to "conduct" is, in my view, quite correct since the arrest power is attached to various types of prejudicial behaviour. The reference to "membership of an illegal organisation" is, however, unhappy since strictly no such arrest should properly be made under Regulation 11. The object of the wording is possibly to refer obliquely to Regulation 24(A) 
- but this regulation is, as I understand it, 
much observed in the breach as a result of rather perverse decision of the courts recently that membership of the Provisional wing did not constitute membership of the IRA. If the letter of 28 June is to be redrafted, I think it better to omit the words "and not simply membership of an illegal organisation".

These are drafting niceties but they might be worth discussing 
with someone in the Army. The Army are understandably sensitive about their arrest powers and if you have an informal talk with them, it would be well to stress that we are not trying in any way to delimit Army powers of arrest: the points we are raising are purely legal ones to avoid any action against the Army in respect of wrongful arrest. Subject to their views, the point at (a) above seems important; the point at (b) less so. 
I have suggested in manuscript a redraft of the Army letter of 28 June.

June 1972 COMMANDER LAND FORCES’ DIRECTIVE FOR 
FUTURE INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS Reference: A. 1. 
CLF’s Conference with Bde Comds on 22 Jun 72. Attached is one copy of Commander Land Forces’ Directive 
for Future Internal Security Operations. It will come into effect at 2359 hrs Mon 26 Jun 72 when the Provisional IRA ceasefire begins. It is to be used as the basis for your brigade instructions. 
2. It should be noted that military powers of arrest are 
currently being examined at the highest level and therefore the guidance given in paragraph 6.g. and Annex A of the Directive is interim only and may be changed. 
3. 4. Once it is clear that the ceasefire is effective, further 
guidance will be issued on various aspects of the security situation, and amendments made to NISSIs 1971 and our Internal Security Instruction 1/72. 
Please acknowledge receipt on the enclosed MOD 24.

ANNEX A TO 1104 G ARREST POLICY 
1. The Special Powers Act, and Regulations made under it, has not been repealed, but the post-ceasefire situation demands that the powers of arrest under Regulation 10 and 11 are not used. Statute and Common Law, however, empower the soldier (like any other citizen) to arrest a person he sees committing, or whom he suspects on reasonable grounds to have committed, a breach of the peace or a serious offence such as serious assault, malicious damage, theft, or possession of an offensive weapon. Mere suspicion is not enough. These powers are commonly used by soldiers at present without recourse to Regulations under the Special Powers Act and are contained in Annex B to Part 3 Section 3 of NISSIs 1971. Their use should continue. 
2. The arrest procedures specified in the Blue Card are not there- 
fore to be used until further notice. 3. 
4. Arrests are to be made in response to the actual commission 
of criminal offences only. They are not to be made for the purpose of interrogation, detention or internment or on mere suspicion. 
Arrests are, wherever possible, to be made by members of the 
RUC. If, in an exceptional case, it is not possible for a member of the RUC to carry out an arrest, soldiers may do so as long as the Common and Statue Law powers of arrest apply. These powers apply essentially to the apprehension of a wrong-doer red-handed. 
5. An arrested person is to be taken to the nearest RUC station 
but not to a PHC. 6. 
The policy described in this Annex relates only to Regulations 
10 - 12 under the Special Powers Act and does not affect other powers under the Special Powers Regulations, for example those of search.

ARRESTS 1. 
The SPA and Regulations made under it will continue to be in operation 
but the new scope of operations means that these powers will be used sparingly. 2. 
Arrests will wherever possible be made by members of the RUC. 3. Arrests will not be made for the purpose of questioning, interrogation 
or internment under the SPA. Arrests will not be made under Regulation 10 of the SPA (which provides for arrests on the authority of a member of the RUC for the purpose of interrogation). 
4. Arrests will be carried out only for criminal offences. Statute and 
common law empower the soldier (like any other citizen) to arrest a person who is committing a breach of the peace or a serious offence such as serious assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon. These powers are commonly used by soldiers at present, without recourse to the SPA. 
5. If, in an exceptional case, it is not possible for a member of the RUC 
to carry out an arrest, the soldier may still use Regulation 11 under the SPA if a criminal offence has been committed but there is doubt whether common and statute law powers of arrest apply. These powers apply essentially to the apprehension of a wrongdoer red-handed, whereas the powers under Regulation 11 entitle a soldier to arrest on suspicion. 
6. In all cases an arrested person is to be taken to the nearest RUC station and not to a PHC.

Secretary of State 1. 
This minute is for the record. At about 5.30 p.m. on Monday 26 June you 
saw the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Cairncross, the Civil Adviser to the GOC, Mr McDowall and myself. 2. 
You approved a new paragraph 9, with two sub-paragraphs, which is attached, 
to be inserted in the Army staff document "Security Forces Reactions to a Ceasefire". (This is the document which General Ford asked me last Wednesday to process through JSC(0) and submit to you. This was done, and a revised paragraph 9 was telexed to Northern Ireland.) The attached redraft is a clarification of the preceding instructions. 3. 
I explained that under sub-paragraph (ii) the persons affected would be those 
against whom there was already an arrest warrant, or sufficient evidence to charge the person on arrest with a crime; but it did not cover persons for whom there was neither evidence for a charge nor a warrant for arrest. I explained that the word "recognised" meant that the person would have to be seen and recognised as coming into the category above. 4. 
You approved the redrafted paragraph in the form it is attached, which 
incorporates the change of wording you asked for in the last sentence of (ii). 5. 
You agreed that these instructions should take effect from midnight tonight, 
and be subject to cancellation or variation by you in the event of a ceasefire not being achieved or sufficiently achieved. 6. 
You agreed that it should be at the discretion of the Army Commander and the 
Deputy Chief Constable how far down the line these instructions should be given in written form, but that it should be made clear that the instructions were an official secret and not for communication to unauthorised persons. 7. 
The revised instructions as attached would enable Mr McDowall to deny the rumour which has been widely publicised in the press that you had annulled or

4. After the initial ceasefire, decisions on the following subjects may 
be necessarys (a) Release of remaining internees. (b) Surrender of weapons. (o) The banning of all parades in uniform (IRA and UDA). (d) Reinstatement of civil police action. (e) Withdrawal to "barracks". (f) Use of the Special Powers Act. 
5. It is assumed that Security Forces action in response to agreement on 
these and many other subjects will be decided at a later stage. Role of the RUC 6. 
Every opportunity given by a ceasefire for the RUC to return to their proper primary role in the enforcement of law and order should be taken.

Principles to be Adopted by the Security Forces 7. 
Patrolling. with the general exception of major roads and interfaces 
all military patrol activity is to be reduced as much as possible consistent with 3(d) above. In the sensitive areas, combined RMP/RUC patrols are to be instituted wherever possible so as to keep open main routes (in Belfast these are marked white on the revised Communities Map). 
8. Protection of the Interfaces. These are to be controlled by the 
Security Forces to prevent sectarian violence. 9) "Arrest policy after the ceasefire should be as follows: (i) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed after these instructions take effect, the due processes of the law will apply, including those under the Special Powers Act. 
(ii) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and if there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances. In regard to matters arising before the ceasefire, persons may, if recognised, be arrested for the purpose of questioning leading to the preferment of charges, but not for purposes leading to internment." vehicle patrol. 
(c) Flak jackets and helmets where appropriate are to be readily available but not worn. 
(d) Improving the appearance of military bases, particularly in central Belfast. 
Border Policy. All cratering and recratering activity to cease. No patrols to approach within one mile of the border except on Brigade authority.

OFFENCES UNDER THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT 1. 
I attach a list of offences created by the Regulations together with 
the penalties where they are provided. 2. 
There are general provisions as to the trial of offences and penalties 
in sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Act. Section 4 provides that where the Regulations do not give a specific penalty, the penalties for any offence shall be as follows:(a) on summary conviction, 2 years or £100 or both; (b) on indictment,3-14 years or £500 or both. 
3. Section 2(1) and (2) make it an offence to fail to comply with any 
order under the Regulations or to attempt, solicit or incite the commission of an act prohibited by the Regulations. Section 2(3) makes it an offence not to inform the civil authority of offences under the Regulations, and 2(4) creates the general offence of committing an act "of such a nature as to be calculated to be prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or maintenance of order ... and not specifically provided for in the Regulations". 
4. Section 3(2) provides that an offence against the Regulations shall not 
be prosecuted except on the authority of or on behalf of the Attorney-General, and "in accordance with such directions as may be given" by him.

"Arrest Policy", you touched upon problems that might arise following a truce. 
In your letter to Jack Howard-Drake of 9 June, about We have already discussed this aspect 
briefly and, without wishing to confuse the present debate on "Arrest Policy", I think it worthwhile trying to clear our minds now on the further problems that might arise upon a truce. 
2. If I understand the position correctly, it is generally 
held that, were the IRA to call a truce, it would be politically dangerous to "lift" known IRA leaders as their safe havens became open to normal police and Army activity. 
in effect, be an amnesty for those IRA men who had managed to evade capture until the date of the truce and who, if they had been captured, could only have been detained or interned under the Special Powers Act, since there was insufficient evidence against them to bring a criminal charge. 
3. But there are two further categories of IRA men. The second category is more difficult; First, 
those against whom there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge, but against whom no warrant has yet been issued. Presumably it is possible to arrange that such men are not charged. 
there 
must be many IRA men,often now taking refuge in the Republic, against whom warrants have been issued. 
If these warrants 
were to be withdrawn you would presumably bring down upon your head immediate calls for the "amnesty" to be extended to all those "political prisoners" who were unlucky enough to be caught and convicted on similar charges before the truce. No doubt you will hear that call anyway with increasing stridency in coming months; 
what I am now concerned with, 
however, is that we should not incur charges of bad faith, with all the attendant political problems, if we continue to arrest certain offenders even after the truce. 
This problem 
has, of course, a wider application than the particular FCO interest, but it was nonetheless a point that was put to me in Dublin recently, and I suspect the Irish Government is every bit as anxious as we are to maintain Mr Whitelaw’s good name for straight dealing in any immediate post-truce period. 
4. It therefore occurred to me that (at the time of any truce) 
it might be desirable for a public announcement to be made that warrants have been issued and will still be executed against 
So there would,

would conclude by saying, in the appropriate legal language, that the DPP had examined all the files relating to offences committed during the late troubles, and had concluded that the evidence available was insufficient to warrant proceedings, against anyone "save those listed above", and that the RUC had therefore closed all other files.

9 June 1972 
J T A Howard-Drake Esq Northern Ireland Office Stormont Castle BELFAST 
At this morning’s meeting which was held by Sir William Nield, Derek 
Stephen of M.O.D. raised the question of the arrangements by which persons arrested by the security forces are handed over to the police. 
The M.O.D. 
are anxious that the Army should be able to hand over such prisoners as soon as possible and I cannot do better than to send you the enclosed copy of a minute by Tony Stephens of 9 June which sets out his Department’s views. Sir William Nield undertook to have this looked into. 
I should perhaps also say that I was apprehensive, when I heard of the 
Army’s trawl of some eight IRA men recently, lest there should follow, as night the day, the usual allegations of ill-treatment. 
This, in fact, 
happened: the Times carried the next day allegations that two of the arrested men had been tortured. 
I spoke to Carol Jackson about this and 
said that I hoped that the RUC had done everything possible to obtain evidence to refut such charges. 
What seems now to be required is a speedy review of RUC procedures for 
dealing with arrested men so as to deal both with M.O.D. anxiety about the arrangements for the RUC taking delivery of prisoners and with the procedure thereafter to protect the RUC from allegations of brutality and to avoid prejudicing criminal charges, if they are subsequently preferred. Ellis’ current enquiries will help us on the latter problem. work is already in hand. 
Some of this May I leave it to you to commission such further 
work as may be required? I am sending a copy of this letter to Tony Hetherington (A.G.’s Office) 
and Tony Stephens (M.O.D.) D J TREVELYAN

DUS(Army DPR(Army Hd/C2(AD M04 
ARRESTS IN NEW LODGE ON 5 JUNE 1972 You asked to be kept informed as more details became 
available about the arrests by 2 Para of eight men in the New Lodge area in central Belfast on Monday 5 June. 2. 
I attach a note which M04 have let me have which shows 
the times at which the eight men were arrested, arrived at the Police Station, and were taken to the PHC. You will see that this is another case where Special Branch chose to conduct their initial questioning other than at the PHC; however, this does not mean that it was a repeat of the Broadway episode in April, since Glenravel is a Police Station as well as an Army command post. Nevertheless this practice does tend to blur the point at which arrestees pass into Police hands and become a Police responsibility; and it is rather worrying that in the present case the RUC were apparently very reluctant to sign for the arrestees,to the extent that they only got round to doing so about eight hours after the men arrived at Glenravel and about four hours after they had been removed to Holywood. This is obviously a point which we will have to press NIO about, either in the context of asking for a copy of the RUC’s instructions about arrests and prisoner handling, or separately. 
3. As you know, NICRA sent a telegram to SSNI on Tuesday 
apparently alleging that one of the eight; who had since been released, had been "tortured" by the Army - and that another had been ill-treated by the RUC under questioning. It is not yet clear at what stage of the afternoon the Army’s offence is supposed to have occurred; until we know this, we cannot tell whether there is any scope for pointing out publicly 
- separately from and in 
advance of Mr. Whitelaw’s reply to NICRA - that the Army not only did not but could not have done what was alleged, for lack of opportunity. M04 are pursuing this.

D J Trevelyan Esq Northern Ireland Office London 
Thank you for your letter of 9 June about the "wanted" list and the arrest and prosecution of IRA leaders from the South. These were discussed at JSC(0) last week, and no doubt you 
will have seen the minutes; paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 refer. (The particular arrests on 5 June had been discussed the week before, when we drew the Army’s attention to the embarrassment which could be caused by their emphasising the standing of IRA figures whom they arrested.) Both the Army and the RUC took the view that their instructions to personnel should ensure that only the more important terrorists, or those who were likely to be charged, were arrested; they also considered, however, that it was right to maintain a full list of suspects, not as "wanted" people but in case the information should be required at any time or in any particular area. 
The Committee accepted that this was reasonable, and I do not think that we can press the point any further for the time being. As to the arrest of IRA leaders from the Republic, we did pass your message 
of 2 June to the Chief Constable the same day. But at JSC(O) the RUC representatives took the view that there was very little prospect of gathering evidence against these men which would be likely to satisfy the courts, and as you say the use of Regulation 10 and 11 in these cases presents obvious difficulties.

Arrest Policy At the request of GEN 79, we have been examing the implications of 
arresting IRA leaders from the South if they visit Northern Ireland, end draft minutes were prepared here, and sent by Neil Cairncross to Philip Woodfield, for S of S to consider sending to the Prime Minister. 
know, on 2nd June I told Carol Jackson the policy which S of S wanted pursued over that weekend. 
As you In fact, no "notables" appeared, but on Monday, 
5th June, it was reported that the Army had arrested eight people, four of whoa were on a "wanted" list, three being senior officers of the Provisional IRA. 
and it was agreed that I should write to you about the subject generally. The feeling here was that the Army should know precisely the 
circumstances in which they ought to make an arrest. It will, no doubt, 
still be necessary for them to continue to work from a list of wanted people, but it seems to be necessary to check which people really need to be arrested, and for what purposes. to be on the list. 
Do we, for example, wish some people to be arrested 
simply for questioning under Regulation 10, being released after 48 hours? There may be a few people wanted for possible detention; but this merely stores up difficulties for ourselves in the future. 
I do not know what 
this problem looks like from your end, but the feeling here was that a review of the lists used by the Army and the RUC should be set in hand, and that the whole subject brought before the Joint Security Committee.

In drawing up Our message I expect 
you have this point on board already. Part of my message to Carol Jackson was that the police should start 
By this we meant that the R.U.C. 
should see what weight can be placed on the activities or public utterances of men like Sean Stephenson in Northern Ireland: could a prosecution be based on them? 
It is very much a second best to have to arrest people under 
Regulations 10 or 11, and the only other way is to arrest them for suspected criminal offences, even if only under such provisions as conspiracy, breach of the peace, incitement etc. 
It may be that the Director of Public 
Prosecutions could give the R.U.C. some guidance on the preparation of such cases. 
Which people, in other words, ought This was discussed at Neil Cairncross’ meeting on Tuesday

It has been suggested that members of the IRA arrested in Northern 
Ireland might, if no charges could be brought against them there, be handed over to the authorities in the Republic. 
To do this without powers would be unlawful. The obvious powers for making such a transfer exist in the 
arrangements for extradition between the United Kingdom and the Republic. 2. 
These arrangements are that the police in either country may obtain a 
warrant for the arrest of a person wanted for a criminal offence and send it to the police in the other country to execute. has to be brought before a court in that country. 
If the person is arrested he The court decides whether 
the person should be surrendered to the other country, and before doing so has to be satisfied that the offence of which he is suspected is one for which he may be surrendered and is not an offence of a political nature. 
Under United 
Kingdom law a person may be surrendered only if the offence of which he is wanted is indictable or punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months or more. 3. 
Thus, in the circumstances under discussion, if a person arrested in 
Northern Ireland was wanted for an offence in the Republic, it would be up to the authorities there (i.e. the Garda) to consider applying for a warrant and sending it to the RUC for execution. 
The most that could be done if it 
were thought desirable to surrender such an arrested person to the Republic would be to let it be known there that he was in custody and enquire whether any warrant for his return would be forthcoming. 4. 
The question would,of course, be highly political in the Republic, and 
there might well be a desire by the authorities there to avoid any action which smacked of collusion with the United Kingdom against Republican elements. 5. 
There would also be political, and possibly legal considerations, for us. 
If the person had been arrested for anything other than a criminal offence (e.g. under Regulations 10 or 11 of the Special Powers Act), the propriety of his being made subject to a warrant applied for in the Republic might be open

This would have to be considered if any particular case The political considerations would arise out of the possible 
reaction to a person, who many people might think ought to have been dealt with before the United Kingdom courts, being handed over to the authorities in a country which does not enjoy a very high reputation for being able to prosecute such people successfully.

BACKGROUND NOTE ON THE ASSOCIATION MR LEGAL JUSTICE FORMATION AND AIMS The ALJ was formed in February 1971. The People’s Democracy were active in its creation along with NICRA and both factions of the IRA. Its originAl aims were to secure the release of all "political prisoners", to protect the rights of such prisoners pending their release and to prevent the introduction of internment. Once internment was introduced its abolition became the ALJ’s prime aim in cooperation with all opposition groups in Northern Ireland. The ALJ defines a "political prisoner" as anyone in prison for an offence arising out of political causes in Northern Ireland. OPERATION It is, of course, Republican oriented. Though the name of the organisation is ambiguous, the ALJ is not in any sense a legal body but a propaganda group. The ALJ forms what might be termed an unofficial complaints bureau whereby anyone having a complaint, real or imagined, can-get in touch with willing solicitors who will take down a deposition which has every appearance of a legal document. This is then publicised, rather than being sent as a serious complaint to the RUC or other authority. ALJ also buys advertising space to publicise the allegations, and they have consolidated allegations of certain subjects and put them out in booklet form. 
It is interesting to note that this technique is justified by ALJ on the grounds that no one can expect justice from the courts here, yet cases when the courts have found against members of the security forces for assault or other offences have been reported in the newspapers.

’facts" of a complaint are never properly checked and there are examples of 
complaints which have had no substance in them. Attempts by the authorities to get to the truth have almost invariably been frustrated by the tactic of refusal to co-operate by the complainant, and the obstructive attitude of some solicitors. So far as is known there is no official ALJ publication and it does not have an "executive role" ie it does not get involved with the Bar Council or any other legal organisations. The ALJ’s prime aim is to seek publicity and they have been largely responsible for the publication throughout the world of anti-internment literature and allegations of brutality by the security forces. Particular targets are the RUC, Special Branch and the Army (particularly the Royal Military Police, Royal Army Medical Corps and, on a couple of occasions, The Parachute Regiment). These activities are not only carried out by the ALJ as an organisation, but also by individual members, eg Fr Faul of St Patrick’s Academy, Armagh. Fundamentally the ALJ provides the IRA with a platform for spreading lies. It is a fact that IRA men have standing instructions that, after being in the hands of the security forces, they should make allegations of brutality. As a result of this, a defendant has now only to say his statement was taken under duress to enjoy a very good chance of having it disallowed - an example of the effectiveness of propaganda. It is not known how the ALJ is financed. The ALJ works very closely with the Campaign for Social Justice, which was the earliest civil rights group in Northern Ireland. MEMBERSHIP Fr Denis Faul of Dungannon is an ALJ committee member, but tends to operate independently. He works very closely with the Campaign for Social Justice, which

also has its HQ in Dungannon, and was co-compiler of a CSJ booklet called "The Mailed Fist" published in December 1971. 
On October 5 1971, through the media, Fr Faul issued guidance to people whose relatives had been picked up by the security forces. Among the points was that relatives should ask for the family doctor to see the arrested person. Fr Faul said he would help with this, and the other points he raised, if the relatives felt this was necessary. 
Fr Faul’s image is that of an ordinary country cleric (with perhaps liberal tendencies) helping the oppressed. In face he is extremely shrewd, and is by no means a liberal. He is a "hardliner" in regard to Catholic education, and an article in the Sunday Press on December 12 1971 showed he was not in favour of changes in the Eire constitution in order to meet Protestant objections. 
In February 1972 he issued a booklet listing alleged Army and RUC brutalities from the preceding December. This was given wide distribution throughout the world, and among the recipients was Edward Kennedy. The English Catholic. Hierarchy also received copies. This is Fr Faul’s normal distribution coverage for any propaganda he sends out. 
Fr Raymond Murray, a chaplain at Armagh Prison, has been helping Fr Faul. Together they put out a joint statement on February 22 1972 listing 25 alleged torture methods. 
Aidan Corrigan, also of St Patrick’s Academy, Dungannon, is associated with Fr Faul and also with the ALJ and the CSJ. Corrigan was responsible for various publications on behalf of Fianna Fail which had false imprints.

The net effect of the legislation and Letters Patent 
referred to above is that the Governor of Northern Ireland succeeds to all the fuctions, rights and ’privileges which hitherto were vested in the Lord Lieutenant. 
Viceroy and by successive Letters Patent which adhered with e Prior to 1920 the Lord Lieutenant was in theory a 
slight alterations to the forms used from the time of Queen Elizabeth His Majesty’s Prerogatives and executive powers in Ireland were delegated to him in the widest terms. All the Royal powers and Prerogatives vested in the pre-1920 Lord Lieutenant were conferred on the post-1920 Lord Lieutenant and eventually on the Governor in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned. 
The Prerogative of Pardon passes to the Governor under 
the general delegation contained in Article 3 of the Letters Patent referred to above and are further amplified and prescribed in Article 5 of the Instructions attached to the Letters Patent. 
These Instructions it may be stated 
follow the line of previous Instructions and are similar to those given to the Governor General of a Dominion, including the Irish Free State. 
EXERCISE OF POWERS BY THE GOVERNOR. 
It has already been stated that Section 8 of the Govern 
ment of Ireland Act, 1920 prescribed that the powers delegated to the Governor are to be exercised through an appropriate Minister. 
Northern Ireland careful consideration was given to the question as to how the provisions of Section 8 of the Act of 1920 were in practical effect to be administered, and with the approval of the then Lord Lieutenant it was arranged that Petitions for remission or reduction of sentences of imprison ment or penalties were to be determined by the Minister acting on behalf of the Lord Lietuenant, but that a list of cases in which the Prerogative had been exercised by the Minister would be submitted from time to time to the Lord Lieutenant for covering authority following the practice which obtains in Whitehall. 
Shortly after the establishment of the Government of It was understood, however, and agreed that this 
procedure would not apply to capital or other important cases which might require special treatment, and in any event not to the special cases referred to in Article 5 of the Instructions referred to above. 
Following the appointment of the Duke of Abercorn as 
Governor steps were taken to inform him as to the practice which had hitherto been in operation and to secure his concurrence in its continuance. His Grace the Governor 
approved of this arrangement and a formal communication was, 
accordingly, sent on the 30th January, 1923, approving of this arrangement. Following on that arrangement all Petitions have been 
dealt with by the Minister, but before a case is presented to the Minister for determination on behalf of His Grace 
steps are taken to obtain the views of the Police Authorities as well as-of the Court which sentenced 
petitioner.

NOTE OF A MEETING 
Mr Johnston, Head of the RUC Special Branch, called on Lord Windlesham at the Minister’s request at 6 15 pm on 2 May. Also present at the meeting were Sir William Nield, Mr Woodfield and Mr Pilling. 
Lord Windlesham explained that in the Secretary of State’s absence he was being invited to sign a Detention Order for a prisoner whom the RUC thought should be interrogated for longer than the 48-hour period which they would otherwise have been limited to. Because of the strong recommendation made to him, Lord Windlesham intended to sign this Detention Order, but before doing so asked that Mr Johnston should explain to him the process of interrogation which the man was now likely to face. 
Mr Johnston explained that a prisoner under interrogation at a Police holding centre would be accommodated in a compartment in a large hut, one side of which was the wall of the hut, two sides of which were high partitions, the fourth side being open to the rest of the room: 
the 
prisoner was required to sit on a chair facing the hut wall. He was not allowed to stand up or to turn round. He would be taken from this compartment for interrogation by a team of one or more Special Branch officers at the discretion of those officers. No interrogation would be made until a preliminary medical examination had been completed. No prisoner would leave the holding centre until a further medical examina-tion had been made. During the interrogation it was a clearly understood rule that no form of physical contact should take place. The interrogation could involve threats, promises and inducements, but, Mr Johnston repeated, it was a clear rule that physical contact was not allowed. Mr Johnston pointed out that as with any organisation there might be cases where an individual did not conform to the rules, but he had made it plain to his Branch that a man who broke the rules would be accountable for the fact. 
When an admission was made during the course of interrogation, Special Branch called on the CID, would remove the prisoner to a Police Station and treat him there in strict accordance with the judges’ rules: statements would be taken, etc. A difficulty was now arising for the RUC in that the Courts were saying that such statements were not sufficient on their own. In addition to being satisfied that the statement had been taken under the judges’ rules, the Courts showed

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
signs of wanting to investigate every detail of the handling of the prisoner since he first came into the hands of the Police: this would include his handling at a Police holding centre, and although Mr Johnston was sure that it could be demonstrated that nothing untoward had happened, the very process of proving this would be lengthy and tiresome, and would expose to public identification a large number of Special Branch officers whose identities were not generally known. 
In an ideal society, a person arrested would be taken straight to an RUC Station and treated within the strict application of the judges’ 
rules. 
But Northern Ireland was far from an ideal society, indeed a state of war existed here. The judges’ rules were simply not compatible with the gaining of intelligence. In Mr Johnston’s view it was still essential to gain intelligence 
- the initiative might fail, or it might take a 
long time to succeed: in any event it would be wrong of the security forces not to keep themselves well informed of the threat of subversion. Interrogation was necessary to produce the intelligence which the security forces needed. [Note: 
made precisely the same point at the Secretary of State’s meeting with General Ford on 1 May./ 
Lord Windlesham said that his concern was to avoid criticism being levelled at the Secretary of State. It was necessary that Detention Orders should.-be signed, and that people should be interrogated. This was something Ministers could and would defend. They could not defend physical contact between the interrogator and his prisoner, and Lord Windlesham was therefore particularly glad to learn that this was specifically prohibited. There were other aspects of the interrogation process (the manner of accommodating the prisoner between interrogations etc) where it might be difficult for Ministers to defend the present procedure 
- but if these procedures were valuable to Special Branch, 
then if the reasons for this could be explained Ministers would be prepared to defend them: if as Mr Johnston had suggested, these procedures were for administrative convenience only, then there would be merit in considering whether they should be changed: Lord Windlesham left this to Mr Johnston to consider and decide.

November 1971 I am writing to let you know that my colleagues and I have felt 
it right to authorise the submission to the Compton Inquiry of a note about the interrogation of detainees. I enclose a copy of the note (marked ’A’). 
The Committee saw representatives of the Ministry of Defence and 
asked questions on the note. I understand that the Committee’s report is likely to set out these paragraphs and then to say that the Committee has taken evidence from officials about the application of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum. The report will then summarise this evidence as in the document ’B’. 
its report, not to ascribe responsibility to any particular section of the security forces; but the publication of this evidence should help to give an accurate impression of the concern of the United Kingdom 
I understand that the Committee will in any event be careful, in 
Government with the rules which were applied. I should be grateful if you could treat this letter and accompanying 
documents as being sent for your own personal information, except that I would see no objection to your showing them to the Attorney General.

NOTE ON INTERROGATION 1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the processes of 
interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen QC issued in November 1966 (Cmd,3165). 
2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by Medical Officer, 
The following are prohibited: (i) violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; 
(ii) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949).) 
3. The precise application of these general rules in particular circumstances 
is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding 
Medical examination nd record of weight of subject on admission and discharge.

1. The objectives mentioned in the memorandum may involve the use of the 
following methods, the circumstances and duration of whose application may vary according to the staff and accommodation available at the interrogation centre and the length of time for which detainees may be left alone or must be kept together:a. 
Wall Standing Requiring detainees to stand with their arms against a wall but not in a position of stress provides security for detainees and guards against physical violence during the reception and search period and whenever detainees are together outside their own rooms in a holding room awaiting interrogation. It also assists the interrogation process by imposing discipline. Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase of staff sufficient to provide for the separate custody of each individual while in transit between his own room and the interrogation room, there would be increased risks of physical violence or of a need for physical contact between detainees and guards. 
b. 
Hooding The hood (a black pillow-slip which the detainee is not required to wear while he is being interrogated or while he is alone in his room) reduces to the minimum the possibility that while he is in transit or with other detainees he will be identified or will be able to identify other persons or the locations to which he is moved. It thus provides security both for the detainee and for his guards. It can also, in the case of some detainees, increase their sense of isolation and so be helpful to the interrogator thereafter. 
C. 
Noise The continuous noise to which detainees may be subjected prevents their

overhearing or being overheard by each other and is thus a further security measure. By masking extraneous sound and making communication more difficult it may enhance the detainee’s sense of isolation. 
d. 
Bread and Water Diet A diet of bread and water at six-hourly intervals may form part of the atmosphere of discipline imposed upon detainees while under control for the purpose of interrogation. The rules about medical inspection are referred to in paragraph 2 of the note above. 
2. These methods have been used in support of the interrogation of a small 
number of persons arrested in Northern Ireland who were believed to possess information of a kind which it was operationally necessary to obtain as rapidly as possible in the interest of saving lives, while at the same time providing the detainees with the necessary security for their own persons and identities.

INTERROGATION: THE FOLLOW UP TO THE REPORT OF THE COMPTON COMMITTEE Introduction The purpose of this note is to explore the course of action 
which the Government might take following the publication of the report of the Compton Committee. 2. 
The paper is based on the assumptions that the report finds 
that physical ill-treatment, though not brutality or cruelty, was used in the interrogation of eleven internees; that the report does not make a judgement as to whether it was right or wrong for physical ill-treatment to be used in the circumstances; and that the Government accepts the findings of the report as regards the treatment of internees under interrogation. 3. 
It is also assumed that the report incorporates in some form 
or another the substance of the Government Note on Interrogation which was submitted to the Committee, and that the general rules for the conduct of interrogation are thus made public. 
The Government’s response to the report 4. 
Once the Compton Committee’s report is published the 
Government will be expected to say not only whether it accepts its findings but also what changes, if any, are to be made to the rules governing the conduct of interrogation in the light of the report’s findings. The Government can react to the Report in one of two ways. 
Either it can decide that the general rules 
as set out in paragraph 2 of the Government’s Note on Interrogation which was given to the Compton Committee should be changed in tae direction of making them less stringent and therefore more favourable to those under interrogation. Or the Government can decide that the principles governing the conduct of interrogation, which have been built up in the light of experience over many years 
Files\\SKD_round1\\DEFE 13 917\\IMG_2311_DEFE_13_917 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
in a number of different situations, have been shown to provide a satisfactory balance between the conflicting interests of the authorities and the detainee and that for this reason the Government does not propose to change the general rules. 5. The advantage of the former course is that it would show that the Government was taking the findings of the Compton Committee report seriously and was doing something positive about them. The disadvantage is that the general rules governing the conduct of interrogation already offer the detainee substantial safeguards against wrongful treatment and it is difficult to see how they can be relaxed any further without bringing about a situation in which the restrictions on the interrogator would be such that effective interrogation would become virtually impossible. Moreover, if these general rules were to be appreciably modified this would amount to condemning retrospectively the interrogation that the Army has had to carry out in a number of situations overseas in the past. 6. 
firm on the principles governing the conduct of interrogation, is that it would enable interrogation in its present form to continue as a means of obtaining intelligence should this be necessary in internal security situations in future. 
On the other hand, the 
Government cannot simply endorse the general rules and leave it at that without some inconsistency with its acceptance of the findings of the Compton Committee report. 
The main advantage of the second course of action, i.e. standing It is therefore suggested that if 
the Government decides to endorse the general principles governing the conduct of interrogation, it should at the same time decide that the detailed application of those rules, i.e. their translation into the practices of interrogation, should be. reviewed.

argument in favour of publication is that it would reassure public opinion; not to publish would almost certainly lead to charges of covering up. 16. The main objection to publication is that the report would be likely to set out in fairly detailed terms what is involved in interrogation and this would mean that anybody who had to be interrogated in future could be expected to have a good idea of the limits to which interrogation would go. This would be likely to reduce the effectiveness of interrogation since the subject would have lost a lot of that uncertainty about what he was facing which he would have in present conditions and which helps to make him cooperate. It would also facilitate training in resistance to interrogation. 17. A further objection to publication is that giving details of interrogation procedures would be likely to arouse still further those sections of the public who can be expected to be opposed on principle to interrogation of any kind. 18. However, once the Government had announced a review by an independent body of interrogation methods, it would be difficult to refuse to publish the body’s report and the Government would probably have to be prepared to release it in the last resort. An important factor in. the Government’s decision would of course be the extent to which the report unavoidably contained classified information. Complaints Commission 19. Whether the report of an independent review body was published or not, some of the heat might be taken out of the situation if when the review was completed the Government announced that, in any future situation where men were being interrogated while interned

or detained for longer than 48 hours, a Commission would be set up immediately to investigate complaints of detainees about their treatment. If such a Commission was to be publicly credible the members would have to be seen to be independent of the Government. The existence of a commission of this kind would offer a practical means of reassuring the public that the rules governing the conduct of interrogation were reasonable and were being properly applied in individual cases and that, in short, nothing was going on which the Government would want to hide. 20. It would be important however that such a commission was confined in its activities to dealing with complaints from detainees. If it was given any wider remit it would in any typical internal security situation be swamped with real and bogus complaints arising out of every clash between the security forces and members of the public, and, as it tried to adjudicate between what would usually be unverifiable claims, could be expected quickly to forfeit public confidence.

Post-1965 there has been Aden, and the RUC Special Branch It is perhaps a point 
worth making that the Services developed the techniques of interrogation in order to train our own people to resist them, and each use of the various techniques has been tested against our own people over the years in the interrogation phase of escape and evasion exercises some of which have involved other nationalities in NATO. 
The

The first on mandatory medical examinations and medical weight records I have mentioned. The second 
was that future interrogation should be undertaken by civilians, meaning presumably police forces. 
I agree absolutely with this as a 
general principle,and in Northern Ireland the RUC conduct the interrogations and personnel of the Joint School of Intelligence are there only to advise and support. 
It has, however, proved impossible to 
transfer either the advisory or the training responsibility because no other organisation maintains an interrogation team in being.

PS/MINISTER OF STATE NORTHERN IRELAND: INTERROGATION 
During the Secretary of State’s meeting this 
morning with the Minister of State, CDS, CGS, PUS, GOC Northern Ireland and AUS(GS), there was some discussion of the present position on the Compton investigation and the recent Sunday Times article about the methods used to interrogate in depth IRA suspects who had been detained for internment. 
2. CGS said that the GOC was anxious to have guidance 
on what to say to the RUC Special Branch about how far HMG would be able to protect them from having to bear the brunt of any criticisms of interrogation methods which resulted from the Compton inquiry. S of S said that, while he quite understood how fragile the morale of the RUC Special Branch was, he found it difficult to answer the GOC’s question. As he saw the situation, once the Compton report had been submitted 
- and, 
according to present expectations, had criticised some of the interrogation methods as amounting to ill-treatment, though not brutality 
- the British Government would 
probably take the line that the techniques in question were those which had been used in all the other emergencies in recent years; that they had been taught. by the Joint Services Intelligence Wing to the RUC; and that they had then been used in Northern Ireland with the broad 
knowledge and the approval of HMG. He did not see how it would be possible to avoid saying that the actual interrogation had been conducted by the RUC. 
3. S of S added that he hoped this was in fact what 
had happened. It had certainly always been his firm intention that the Army’s participation in the interrogation process should be confined to providing back-up in the sense of expert advice and technical support; he therefore found it difficult to understand why it was that we now anticipated much of the criticism being directed at the Army. CGS confirmed that S of S’s understanding was in fact correct, i.e. that the Army team at Ballykelly had confined itself to the support role. The GOC said that he had certainly encouraged the RUC to

INTERROGATION DGI has asked me to bring to your attention the attached 
minute sent yesterday by DMSI to the Secretary of the JIC. 
understand that the Secretary of the JIC has forwarded it to the Prime Minister. 
The minute sets out the principles governing hooding, the use of white sound, and standing against a wall, 
2. It does not 
discuss the question whether what was done in Northern Ireland as recorded in the Compton Report was fully in accordance with these principles. 
3. However, it is possible (as indicated in my separate minute 
of today to PUS, not to all) that Sir Edmund Compton has not in all respects correctly interpreted the evidence presented to him. 
This point will be followed up separately. Meanwhile 
VCGS, in consultation with the Defence Intelligence Staff, is initiating a domestic enquiry into the techniques and methods taught at JSIW, and their application. 
to VCGS that the Commandant of the Intelligence Centre and Inspector of Intelligence should be asked:- 
(a) To examine, and recommend whether any changes are desirable in, the techniques and methods taught at JSIW as adjuncts to the process of interrogation of prisoners or detainees. 
(b) To enquire into the advice that was given to the RUC Special Branch in respect of those methods and techniques, and the circumstances, intensity, and duration of their application; and to recommend whether any changes are desirable in the application of these methods and techniques in internal security operations. 
It is being recommended I 1971.

13 October 1971 
Sir Philip Allen GCB Home Office Whitehall LONDON S W 1 
I enclose the draft of the section of the Northern Ireland Detainee Enquiry dealing with the complaints made of physical brutality in respect of 2 of the persons who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them. My 2 colleagues and I may wish to make some minor drafting amendments before the complete Report is delivered, but otherwise this is our final text subject to security clearance. In particular, we are agreed on the conclusions as stated on the last 4 pages. 
As you know, the Enquiry has been given unrestricted access to documents and contemporary records, and both the Ministry of Defence officer (Lt Col Nicholson) and the RUC Special Branch officer (name withheld from us) in charge of the operation have shown us all their records and have supplied us with full information about the methods used and their application to the 2 complainants whose allegations we have investigated. We were, however, given access to their evidence, documentary and oral, on the footing that it was "classified secret" and not be be published in our Report without security clearance. 
As I explained to you on 4 October, and as the draft Report will show you, the allegations which the Home Secretary asked us to investigate have produced specific detailed accounts of the physical experiences of these 2 men under interrogation. Our investigation has inevitably taken the course of testing the allegations against the facts so far as we can ascertain them, and finding to what extent the events were as alleged or otherwise. In the draft Report I now send you, we have done our best to comply with what we understand to be the security requirements, in that:- 
(a) We say nothing of the interrogation process itself, or of its results. 
(b) We confine ourselves to saying what was done, without saying if it was pert of the method (though aware that methods may be inferred, correctly or otherwise, from statements of what was done). 
(c) We avoid identifying the place, and cut down the identification of documentary sources to the,minimum that we feel to be essential in order to substantiate our conclusions.

I attach two personal notes on this subject which are having no wider distribution.

Documentary Evidence The contemporary documentation which we can specify, and 
which is of the first importance in testing the facts, is as follows. (1) The entry medical record, written by the doctor when he examined each detainee on entry into the centre on 11 August. The purpose of this examination was for the doctor to certify whether the detainee was fit for interrogation: we have confirmed that before he did so, he was briefed as to the conditions that the interrogate would experience. The patient was stripped and examined, his medical history and present state of health ascertained and recorded; in particular the record provides for a note of the patient’s wei ht and the existence or otherwise of cuts, bruises or other bodily damage. (2) The exit medical record, written by the same doctor, when he examined the detainee on leaving the centre on 18/August. (3) A colour photograph of the detainee, naked, back view and front view, likewise taken on his leaving the centre on 17 August. (4) The prison medical record of the examination carried out by prison doctor on 18 August after the detainee 
was lodged in Belfast

Prison detention centre. (5) The feeding record 
- Between 11 and 14 August the detainees 
diet at the centre consisted of a 6-hourly administration of 1 pint of water and 1 round of bread. We have examined the contemporary record which was kept showing the time at which each detainee was offered the drink and food, if he took it and what he took. (The record shows that from 15 August the diet was stepped up to full scale rations on 16 August.

for anything between 4 and 6 hours, except for periodical lowering of the arms to restore circulation. It was’ also confirmed that detainees attempting to rest or sleep 
by propping their head against the wll were prevented from doing so. If a detainee collapsed to the floor he was picked up by the armpits and placed against the wall to resume the approved posture. In Mr oClean’s case it was said that he persisted in collapsing from the start and after a short time was not forcibly held up but allowed to lie on the floor. Food and drink It was confirmed that the detainees were kept on a sparse diet 
for the first 3 days (bread and water every six hours) but it was denied that either food or water was withheld. As the feeding record showed, the bread and water had been regularly offered.. Mr Shivers had been without food or occasionally drink for almost 3 days, because he had consistently refused it. This was thought to account for the considerable loss of weight in his case. Mr MoClean had consistently refused water for a lengthy period.

Toilet and Lavatory Facilities (NB Mr McClean, not Mr Shivers, complained under this head.) It was not true that opportunity to relieve bowels or urinate 
was denied him or that it was several days before he was allowed to the toilet for the first time. The lavatory facilities were there. The detainees could and did use them on demand, being taken to them by a guard. It was Mr MClean’s own fault that he did not do so. Due they thought, to his general policy of "going limp on the system", there had been three such occasions. Once Mr McClean had wet himself on the way to the lavatory, and his overalls had been changed. Another time he had urinated on his mattress. A third time (when visited by the doctor and asked for a specimen) he had urinated on the floor of his cell. The Medical Officer, in his oral evidence to us, confirmed that the lavatory facilities were satisfactory, and available and used by all except Mr McClean, who in his opinion did not use them on the occasions mentioned because he chose not to do so. Physical assault All the specific allegations by Mr MoClean were denied.

Press Secretary 10 Downing Street Whitehall LONDON SW1 
SUNDAY TIMES INSIGHT TEAM Bruce Page rang the S of S’s private office shortly after 
1971 
internment (Auust 10) to ask for an interview with S of S on Northern Ireland. At that time our policy was for S of S not to take part in TV or press interviews since the Northern Ireland Government and the Home Office were taking the lead on the policy of internment. I telephoned Page on Friday 13 August to turn down his request. He said he would like to talk to an official or a soldier about the success or failure of internment. I said he must go to the Home Office on that topic. He went on to indicate that he knew that General Tuzo had argued against the policy at the meeting with Mr Faulkner in London and some of the detail he added indicated to me that someone had been talking to him unwisely. I repeated the public line taken by the Home Office at the time of internment, but Page told me his information about the GOC’s attitude came from No 10 and the Home Office. He went on to discuss the situation in Ulster in terms which left me in no doubt that his sympathies lay with the trouble-makers in Ulster. 
Yesterday I heard from DPR(A) that Bruce Page had approached 
the former Chief of Staff, Brigadier Dyball, and asked for "the inside story" of his period of service in Ulster. This request has, of course, been refused. DPR(A) also reports to me that the Insight representative in Northern Ireland, Murray Sayle, is considered by the Army to be unreliable and hostile. 
We have spoken about this and all the evidence indicates that 
the Insight team should be treated with extreme caution. I have asked DPR(A) to let HQ Northern Ireland have our views. 
One final point. It is not without inte that some of the 
names of internees mentioned in last Sunday’s Insight article are also mentioned in the story on Ulster in the current Private Eye ("Gone to Lynch" pp 19/20). This is written under the heading "Footnotes" which presumably indicates that it is written by Paul Foot himself. However, what is very evident is that Insight and 
Private Eye (who have been straight pro IRA on Ulster) may have access to the same sources.

Copies to: US of S(Army) CGS

1. At your meeting last Thursday I raised the question of the 
procedure for authorising the use of deep interrogation. Since then it has been made clear that the political responsibility for this is vested in the Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs. This is contrary to the impression I received from advice in a previous case and the terms in which I approved the use of Army support. Also, on the advice of Mr. Woodfield it has been agreed that it is not necessary for MOD Ministerial approval to be obtained in each case where Army support is required. 
2. I have not been involved in the discussions which have led 
to the arrangements governing the procedures for deep interrogation. I feel though that I should let you know that I am not completely satisfied with certain aspects of these arrangements. We seem to be in some danger of losing all control over the use of interrogation by Stormont which, despite the niceties of the political and legal position, would fall to HMG to defend. My doubts are not made any less by Mr. Woodfield’s account on Monday to the Home Secretary of Stormont’s attitude to the internment orders and the activities of the Advisory Committee. 
3. My first concern is that the use of interrogation is 
authorised in terms which are not clear and unequivocal. Authority is simply given for the removal of a person from A to B "where his presence is required in the interests of justice". This really doesn’t seem sufficient, and in my view the Minister for Home Affairs should authorise the act of deep interrogation in specific terms. 
4. For much the same reason I consider that we should continue 
to approve each case where Army support is required and we should be satisfied with the reasons given for the use of interrogation before we agree. Otherwise, as I have already said, we shall lose control of the situation. Should you agree, the terms of our approval will have to be amended from those previously used, to indicate that we are authorising the use of Army support only and not the interrogation itself.

PROCEDURES FOR DEEP INTERROGATION OF DETAINEES 
the Minister of State questioned the practice whereby the approval of a Ministry of Defence Minister has been sought for the provision of Army support in each individual case in which the RUC has wished to subject a detainee to deep interrogation. 
At the Secretary of State’s meeting on Thursday, 9 September, 2. Following the decision to permit an extension of the scope 
of the Compton Inquiry to cover allegations of brutality during deep interrogation, the Prime Minister ruled that for each specific future case Ministerial clearance should be sought in London and that it could be most appropriately given by a Ministry of Defence Minister. 
(Presumably on the ground that the Home 
Secretary has no executive authority over any of the parties involved.) 
3. During Mr. Woodfield’s visit to Northern Ireland to persuade 
the RUC Special Branch to co-operate with the Compton Inquiry in this phase of its work, he formed the opinion that it was not necessary to seek individual clearance in London of each specific instance, provided that UK Ministers are kept informed of what is happening and in particular are made aware immediately of any proposal to subject a large number of persons to deep interrogation. The legal position is that the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs, being a Civil Authority under the Special Powers Acts, makes an order under Regulation 11(5) authorising the removal of X now detained in place Y, to any place where his presence is required in the interests of justice. 
This covers his removal 
to the place of interrogation and is in effect a political endorsement of a need for interrogation (no special legal authority is required for the deep interrogation of a person already detained under the Special Powers Acts). 
4. 
Mr. Woodfield’s recommendation has been agreed by the Home Secretary and cleared with the Prime Minister’s office. 
I 
understand from APS/S of S that when he reported this to the Secretary of State on Friday, 10 September, S of S also agreed that it could be accepted and that it would not henceforward be necessary to seek specific Ministerial approval within the MOD before each occasion on which it was desired to obtain military advice or support for deep interrogation by the RUC Special Branch. Requirement to keep Ministers informed is, however, still valid.

SECRETARY OF TATE NORTHERN IRELAND: POINTS FOR CABINET 
The following list of topics for possible discussion in Cabinet this evening is framed against the background that: 
(i) the PM is unable to hold a separate meeting on Northern Ireland before Cabinet, but would be willing to hold one immediately after Cabinet if you so wished, with Philip Allen and Stewart Crawford. 
(ii) AUS(GS) will be visiting Belfast tomorrow, departing early in the morning, for talks with the GOC and others. 
2. 
The points for possible discussion this evening are: a. 
Interrogation of Detainees We are told that 
the RUC team who have been doing the interrogation have already obtained so much material that they want to break off the questioning while they analyse the information already gleaned. This has been agreed by Stout, and the Army team which has been supporting the RUC has been told to prepare to withdraw. DGI considers that a complete halt would be very bad tactics and that at least some of the RUC team should continue the questioning while others are analysing the material already obtained. There is some urgency about this since, once the teams have been stood down,it will take time to re-activate them. 
Hockaday, who has already raised the point 
with Home Office, suggests that you simply draw attention to it and say that, unless there are any objections from colleagues, you propose to get the GOC and UK Rep to pursue it with the NI Government. 
It is a little doubtful whether this item 
ought to be discussed in full Cabinet but, if you are not keen on a separate meeting, there is probably no real objection to raising it in Cabinet.

Service personnel are instructed in the art of interrogation in depth, and where members of our Services are also taught to be resistant to such interrogation. Even at such a centre there are no standing orders or manuah dealing in detail with the use of such techniques, and accordingly their exact application in real life situations depends upon the training already received by those who employ them. It will be seen at once that such techniques can easily be used to excess, and specially so when their use is entrusted to 1

To illustrate the matter, we understand that the Service training envisages a comparatively short period at the wall and subjection to hooding and noise there, while the detainees are taken one by one to be medically examined and the method of interrogation is assessed. Once

terrogation has taken place, it is envisaged that normally the detainee taken to a cell and not returned to the wall, or be hooded or sub-

16. We considered the results of such experiments as have been made in connection with sensory deprivation. We heard evidence concerning army personnel who had been subjected to these techniques in order to train them in resistance. In such cases no lasting mental effect whatever has been ob6rved, but in our opinion this is by no means conclusive. The real thing is obviously quite different from the experiment. We also heard evidence of experiments conducted on student volunteers. usually involving a more extreme form of sensory deprivation. In these cases many of the volunteers were found unable to withstand such sensory deprivation for more than a comparatively short period. However, not only were the experiments again of necessity different from the real thing, but in these cases the volunteers neither enjoyed a break during which medical examination and later interrogation took place, nor were they members of an organisation bound together by bonds of loyalty which would help them to hold out.

NORTHERN IRELAND: ARREST POLICY AND GUIDELINES FOR INTERROGATION I have received from the Northern Ireland Office copies 
(attached) of the letters in which they have conveyed to the GOC and Chief Constable the recent Ministerial decisions about arrest policy and the procedures to be followed for interrogation. The text of both documents was approved by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland: our Secretary of State saw an earlier version of the document on interrogation which did not differ substantially from the attached.

Sir Graham Shillington CBE RUC Headquarters Brooklyn Knock Road Belfast BT5 6LB 
Ministers have now considered further the policy on arrests which is to be followed in present circumstances in Northern Ireland. 
The Secretary of State has asked me to send you the enclosed copy of a document setting this policy out, together with an annex which deals with the basic rules, requirements and methods to be followed during interrogation operations. May we now leave it to you to issue suitable instructions to members of th RUC so that the policy in these documents will be strictly observed? 
The document setting out the basic rules for interrogation operations should, as it makes clear, be read in conjunction with the "Directive on Interrogation to the Armed Forces in Internal Security Operations" which Woodfield sent you under cover of his letter of 2nd August 1972. I should perhaps stress that what is said in that letter stands. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to the GOC. J T A Howard-Drake

ARREST POLICY 
The following should be arrested if the opportunity arises: a) 
b) c) d) e) 
Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to justify the preferring of criminal charges. 
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which might justify the preferring of criminal charges (subject to further questioning). 
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal proceedings. 
Anyone caught in the act of committing or having just committed a criminal offence. 
Anyone caught in the company of someone caught in the act of committing or having just committed a criminal offence if there is reason to think he may be able to give information about the offence or important information about the IRA generally. But an arrest under e) by a member of HM Forces acting without the express authority of an RUC officer should only be made if he suspects the person concerned of having committed acts, or being about to commit acts, prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order. 
2. Anyone arrested will bequestioned first in accordance with 
Judges’ Rules, if there is any possibility of criminal charges being brought. Thereafter he may be questioned at large in accordance with the instructions in the attached Annex to see whether he can provide any valuable information about criminal activities.

military evaluation and dissemination of information on subjects, acting on the instructions of the RUC. The military staff for this purpose will consist of one Intelligence Corps Officer, assisted by three Intelligence Corps NCOs, and clerical and photographic staff. 17. The army will be responsible for providing secure communications between the installations within the interrogation system and the appropriate RUC and military headquarters. Period of Detention for Interrogation 18. If a person is arrested under Regulation 10, he may be held in custody for questioning for 48 hours; and if he is then re-arrested under Regulation 11, he may be held for questioning for a further 24 hours. He must then be released unless he is charged or made subject to a detention order. Similarly, a person arrested in the first instance under Regulation 11 may be hold in custody for questioning for a period of up to 72 hours before being released, charged or made subject to a detention order. Methods of Interrogation 19. The detailed questioning of subjects will begin after an initial assessment of each individual has been completed. This assessment is concerned mainly with the background information on each person, his personality type and his physical and mental state at the time. 20. A carefully planned series of questions will then be put to the subject. 21. The approach to be used will be decided by the duty watch commander in charge of the interrogation. Under no circumstances will the methods used include any form of ill treatment. Strict discipline will be maintained. 22. It is not possible to lay down rules for the length of time for which an individual may be continuously interrogated. Much will depend on the urgency with which information is required and some subjects may be willing to volunteer information. In such cases the procedure will obviously be shortened. Since other methods of bringing pressure upon a subject are not permitted, proper scope must be given to interrogation teams to exploit their other advantage 
- that the subject is an 
individual and is outnumbered. The extent to which interrogation teams exploit this advantage must vary with the circumstances, the principal factor being the judgement as to whether the subject has information of great value to give. For example, it would be permissible to carry out sustained interrogation of a high level suspect until all useful information has been extracted from his provided his treatment is

NORTHERN IRELAND The Secretary of State held a short internal meeting 
at 3.15 yesterday afternoon in preparation for a meeting of GEN 79 later in the afternoon. CGS, PUS, DUS(ARMY) and AUS(GS) were present. The following main points were discussed. 
General Situation 2. 
CGS, who had just returned from Northern Ireland, 
said that there was considerable unease there lest no solution emerged from the proposed political talks and the Security Forces found themselves in a weaker position by the end of the year. 
Preventive Detention 3. 
CGS said that there were differing views in Northern 
Ireland on arrest policy and on what to do with those who were arrested. It was noted that a case could be made for the introduction of preventive detention as being preferable to internment without trial; but legislation would be required, and S of S judged that this would present Parliamentary difficulties which would prevent early action. It was agreed that there would be advantage in pursuing other legal measures (proscription of terrorist organisations, stricter control of unlicenced vehicles etc.), which did not require Parliamentary action. It was agreed that the Cabinet Office paper on legal issues which was under preparation should make clear the distinction between these two categories. (I should be grateful if AUS(GS) would take action on this). 
Internment 4. 
CGS reported that the Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland was anxious that all those at present interned should be released. The Army’s view was that this would not be disastrous, provided that the possibility of interning those who were arrested in future was kept open. S of S doubted whether this was realistic; the SDLP could hardly be expected

to go on talking to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if new internments were being made. 
Interrogation 5. 
CGS reported that two interrogation centres had been 
in operation since the start of MOTORMAN. S of S commented that it was unsatisfactory that this should have been done without proper authority, while the matter was still under discussion by Ministers. (I should be grateful if AUS(GS) would take this up with the NIO).

INTERROGATION BY THE SECURITY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
Ref A’: Directive on Interrogation by the Armed Forces in Internal Security Operations (JIC(A)(72)21 dated 29 June) 
INTRODUCTION 
1. JIC(A)(72)21 sets out the general principles on which interrogation in internal security operations is to be based. In operations in Northern Ireland 
it is to be applicable to both the RUC and to the army or other services concerned. AIM 
2. The aim of this instruction, which supplements JIC(A)(72)21 is to set out the basic rules, requirements and methods to be followed during interrogation operations in Northern Ireland. It is applicable to, and covers the responsibilities of both the RUC and the armed forces taking part. It will be considered always in conjuncti with Ref A. 
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
The Object of Interrogation 3. 
Under the present arrest policy most people arrested are being questioned with 
a view towards criminal charges being brought; but those against whom charges cannot be brought are being questioned for intelligence purposes according to instructions already issued (Ref A). This will continue. But those who are questioned for intelligence purposes may, at the discretion of the RUC, be taken to a Police Office for interrogation. That interrogation will be carried out just as if it had taken place under existing instructions but the following instructions should also be 
observed. General Procedures 4. 
As soon as possible, as much information as can be obtained about the subject 
should be made available to the interrogator. It will be essential to have information which positively identifies the subject, together with the reason for and circumstances of the arrest.

appointed as medical officers to the staff of the Police Offices, but they should NOT in any sense supervise the subjects’ treatment at the hands of the guards or interrogators. Medical examinations of subjects for interrogation are mandatory on admission to and discharge from a Police Office, including temporary transfers, and a full record of these examinations will be made,the same time. Medical treatment is to be. available as required. If a subject refuses absolutely to be medically examined a note to this effect will be made. A medical officer must be 
on call in the medical inspection room while interrogation is in progress. 14. All subjects in Police Offices are to be seen daily by a medical officer and asked if they have any complaints; any allegations of ill treatment hold be reported at once to the appropriate superior medical headquarters or senior responsible civil or service authority. Police Offices (POs) 15. The conduct of interrogation at POs. will be the responsibility of the RUC. Within the PO all subjects will be handled throughout by the RUC. The military staff (apart from medical) will have no contact with arrested persons. 16. The Army will be responsible at the POs for the recording, collation, military evaluation and dissemination of information on subjects, acting on the Instructions of the RUC. 
The military staff for this purpose will 
consist of one Intelligence Corps Officer, assisted by three Intelligence Corps NCOs, and clerical and photographic staff. 17. The army will be responsible for providing secure communications between the installations within the interrogation system and the appropriate RUC and military headquarters. Period of Detention for Interrogation 18. A person arrested under Regulation 10 may be questioned for 48 hours. If he is not released by being rearrested under Regulation 11 he may be questioned for a further 24 hours. He must then be released unless a detention order as been made against him. If a detention order is made

he may continue to be questioned subject to the approval of the Northern Ireland Office being obtained. Methods of Interrogation 19. The detailed questioning of subjects will begin after an initial assessment of each individual has been completed. This assessment is concerned mainly with the background information on each person, his personality type and his physical and mental state at the time. 20. A carefully planned series of questions will then be put to the subject. 21. The precise method of interrogation will be decided by the duty watch commander in charge of the interrogation. Under no circumstances will the methods used include any form of ill treatment. Strict discipline will be maintained. The above paragraph discusses methods of interrogation without saying what possibilities are available. 
Is paragraph 21 really necessary? The last sentence in particular raises all sorts of doubts.]

DRAFT LETTER TO ADMS. NORTHERN IRELAND MEDICAL OFFICERS AND INTERROGATION 
1. This letter lays down supplementary Guidance for medical officers 
who may find themselves medically responsible for persons who are being detained and interrogated. 2. 
Medical officers have no part to play in the actual process of 
interrogation, directly or indirectly. 3. 
All subjects admitted to and discharged from Police Offices are, however, to be medically examined, in their own interests, in

The consent of the subject to full medical examination is desirable 
since without such consent examination can amount to little more than medical inspection, with the limitations inherent in such a superficial procedure. 
The withholding of consent should be recorded. 5. Evidence of injury is to be recorded and if ill treatment is 
alleged or suspected reported to the senior administrative medical officer.

considerably strengthened. It will be essential to have information which positively identifies the subject, together with the reason for and circumstances of the arrest. 8. The circumstances of the arrest or capture of a subject for interrogation have considerable bearing on the success or otherwise 
of his subsequent interrogation. The circumstances may not only supply the interrogator with the information he needs to plan his approach but ay, if properly planned, also condition the subject’s mental attitude towards his captors and interrogators. 9. 
close liaison will be established at an early stage between 
the RUC officer in charge of Op SHAFTO an the RUC and military intelligence/operational staffs responsible for planning arrest or capture operations. 10. Special care will be needed when arresting a subject. Questions or answers at the arrest stage should be restricted to those essential for the circumstances of the moment, since certain actions or conversations with the subject may prejudice subsequent action if it is decided to charge the subject. It may also prejudi subsequent interrogation or the legality of the arrest. These considerations will be covered in the operational instruction dealing with arrest policy and procedures issued by the RUC and HQT 41. As soon as subjects have been handed over to RUC custody, all movement thereafter ill be an RUC responsibility and RUC escorts will be provided. Movement may take place in military transport, but there will be no direct contact at any stage between military personnel and subjects for interrogation. PRIMARY INTERROGATION 
12. This will be carried out at Screening Centres or RUC stations by the RUC SB and CID staffs provided for the purpose, as soon as possible after arrest:-

PS/S of S PS/Minister of State PS/US of S(Army) MA/VCGS 
GOC NI MO 4 DS 10 
CGS MEETING WITH S OF S NI - PM 3 AUGUST 1972 1. 
CGS had an extremely satisfactory meeting with Mr Whitelaw 
on the evening of Thursday August 3rd to discuss particularly interrogation and preventive detention. Mr Cairncross was present throughout as Sir William Nield is on leave. 
2. Interrogation. CGS showed Mr Whitelaw AUS(GS)’s minute and 
the draft directive attached to it; you have copies of both of these. Mr Whitelaw said that he would send the paper and directive to the Prime Minister that evening, without commitment, saying that he had discussed them with the CGS and proposed to discuss them with him, the Prime Minister, on 4th August. He also intends to talk to S of S over the weekend saying that he accepts the need for extended interrogation, he accepts that this cannot be done in every Police Station and that he accepts the need to establish Police Offices in Castlereagh, to cover Belfast, and Ballykelly, to cover the 8 Brigade area, purely because there is no suitable Police Station in Londonderry itself. He is not, however, all that keen to establish a third Office at Armagh, but has not totally vetoed the idea and if necessary could be persuaded. He is, however, desperately concerned about the inevitable allegations of brutality which will arise but, if the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State agree with the establishment of these Offices, he will issue the directive to the Chief Constable without having a further Gen 79 meeting. As far as Gen 79 was concerned the earliest it could really be held was next Thursday, as Mr Whitelaw himself intended to be in his constituency on Friday. He said that Lord Balniel should be told that the paper had gone without commitment to the Prime Minister, and AUS(GS) did this. 
3. Preventive Detention. S of S NI would now put a paper to his 
colleagues saying that when Parliament reassembled it should have before it a paper on the Tribunal/Special Courts issue setting out the problem. Clearly no legal legislation could be put through in this session. 
In the meantime, however, he was perfectly prepared 
to make more extensive use of his powers to detain and would do so until the issue was discussed in the house. At the Gen 79 meeting towards the end of next week the NIO would produce a preliminary paper for discussion. 
4. CGS mentioned the difference between Regulation 11 of the 
Special Powers Act which allowed holding (and questioning) for an indefinite period and Regulation 10 which had a statutory 48 hour time limit; it was this time limit that had been extended to those held under Regulation 11, by usage rather than by statute.

Interrogation in Northern Ireland -Note of Meeting Minister of State held a meeting at 16. 00 on 2nd August

Instructions for Interrogation 4. 
In discussion of the draft Part II Directive (circulated 
by DUS(Army) on 25th July) the following points were made: detainees would be aware of the availability of medical attention, because the instructions would ensure that they were seen every day by a doctor; detainees would therefore have an opportunity every twenty-four hours of complaining if they did not feel they were getting enough sleep or rest.

Hooding was not allowed and, if it was 
necessary to move men between interrogation points this could be done in blacked out vehicles if security considerations made this necessary. 
It was agreed that " and co-operate" in para 3a so cause the subject to Para. 10 of the instructions

is wholly a matter for the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary and the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland will not be concerned with it. 
It is, however, very important the 
that the troops should have clear guidance on/treatment of arrested persons before they are handed over to the RUC. There is already a NI Standing Instruction on this point: but recent cases have shown the need to supplement this Standing Instruction, in particular to warn troops against the use of Regulation 7 (which empowers troops to stop and question persons) to remove people to a military post for extensive questioning.

INTERROGATION BY THE RUC At the last meeting of GET 79, the Prime Minister asked 
that proposals should be drawn up, by the time the next meeting took place, regarding the future basis for the questioning of suspects by the RUC. In fact the Northern Ireland Secretary will not be in a position to make a definitive report at this evening’s meeting, since there has not yet been time for him to consult the Defence Secretary and the Attorney-General 
- let 
alone for exploring the ground with the RUC or the Northern Ireland Bench. However, Mr. Whitelaw is being provided with a speaking note reporting the tentative conclusions reached by officials at a meeting on 16 May, which BGS(Int) and I attended. A copy of this note is attached; Minister of State will no doubt wish to be aware of it before the meeting. 
2. In a nutshell, what is being suggested is as follows: a. 
- normally, of course, its CID - 
Where a suspect is being questioned in respect of some specific crime, the questioning by the RUC 
be strictly within the terms of the Judges Rules. (As the note explained, these Rules are themselves reasonably flexible.) This should minimise the risk of any admission made by the accused person, in the course of questioning, being declared inadmissable in subsequent Court proceedings against him. 
b. 
However, where i. 
the suspect is being held for 
questioning under the Special Powers Act, 
and ii. the Police consider that there is little hope of obtaining information from him if the questioning is 
PS/US of S(Army) of State should

done strictly within the Judges Rules; 
and iii. the Police further consider that, in the particular case, obtaining ouch information or intelligence is relatively more important than trying to secure a conviction,

The main requirement in this latter case should be that the questioning is in all respects legal. (The Judges Rules procedures are designed to ensure admissability rather than legality.) 
d. 
The procedures and methods to be used by the Special Branch should in any event be no less stringent than those laid down for any future military interrogation in the directive which is now in course of being approved (post Parker).

When questioning has been conducted to this lower standard, we must accept that in most

that MOD would be unlikely to dissent if they were later adopted as firm policy. It is clearly in the Army’s interest that the Special Branch should be no more circumscribed than is necessary in their ability to obtain vital and urgent intelligence from suspected terrorists. Hence we would be reluctant to see them held strictly to the Judges Rules. At the same time we must obviously agree that the Special Branch should be given no greater latitude than the Armed Forces will themselves have if and when 
3. While Minister of State will not wish to c omit MOD irrevocably to supporting these propositions only tentative as yet - 
military interrogation is undertaken in future; for MOD to argue otherwise would be absurd. Moreover, it is in the Army’s interest that suspected terrorists should 
not only reveal 
information but should also, as far as possible, be kept out of circulation; if internment is in future to be available only exceptionally - if at all - for this purpose, then it becomes important for us as well as for the civil authorities that as few prosecutions as possible founder because the accused’s confession has been obtained by means which totally rule out its admissability. Therefore the nearer that Special Branch can keep

JOINT DIRECTIVE ON INTERROGATION IN OPERATIONS BY THE ARMED FORCES 
INTRODUCTION 1. Persons arrested or detained during military operations, but particularly 
during Internal Security operations or in near emergency situations are likely to be valuable sources of intelligence. 
Even though there will normally be 
other ways of gaining information interrogation ay sometimes be the only source of intelligence 
at a time when it is urgently required. 
2. When British forces are operating in aid of the civil power, the conduct of interrogation is a matter for the civil authorities. 
If it should be 
necessary for Service personnel to carry out interrogation in order to obtain intelligence in any military operation, or if, in exceptional circumstances, the civil authority is unable to carry out interrogation, the principles and procedures set out in this directive shall apply. 
Before Service personnel 
are used for interrogation, the approval of UK Ministers is necessary in each specific case. 
3. Successful interrogation depends upon careful planning of the procedures 
for handling subjects for interrogation and of the interrogation itself. Successful interrogation my be a lengthy process. 
Any subject therefore must be properly handled and treated from the moment of his arrest and adequate facilities provided for his interrogation.

WE DO NOT SEEK TO INITIATE A GENERAL PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE IRISH REPUBLIC IN THIS MATTER. BUT EQUALLY WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO LEAVE UNANSWERED ACCUSATIONS THAT IRA ACTIVITIES ALL ORIGINATE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THAT INCIDENTS ON THE BORDER ARE DUE TO BRITISH POLICIES AND THE PROVOCATION OF ESSENTIALLY LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC. THIS GUIDANCE MAY THEREFORE BE USED, AS APPROPRIATE, EITHER TO COUNTER IRISH PROPAGANDA, OR TO INSTRUCT THE ILL-INFORMED THAT IRA ACTIVITY IS NOT A SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENT OF ROMAN CATHOLICS SEEKING CIVIL RIGHTS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE ANY IRISH CLAIM THAT THEY ARE DOING ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE IRA IN THE REPUBLIC.

E38/D/Min/RB/5 March , 1972 As requested in Cairncross’s letter to you yesterday notes 
for supplementaries on the SAS and the Moore Case are attached. These are incorporated with several other comments that we have on the Notes for Supplementaries already circulated. 
I am sorry the notes on the Moore case are long but it has 
been assumed that you have little information on it so far and it was necessary to give you some background. There are a number of questions that could arise other than those which were mentioned in GEN 77 yesterday. As you will see from our comments, the Prime Minister is recommended to avoid getting into the details of this case on the grounds that Moore was only detained for 48 hours and not subjected to interrogation in depth or the techniques discussed in the Parker Report. 
With regard to the notes on the supplementary dealing with 
the legal protection of servicemen I should add that this subject has been discussed between the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office, and it has been agreed that: 
a. We should not rule out civil actions against the Crown on account of deep interrogation (or other matters). Some 25 actions are pending, including 3 arising out of deep interrogation. We would, however, continue to protect the identities of the individuals concerned and their costs and any damages would be paid by the Crown. 
b. For the time being at least, we should do nothing about the possibility of privately initiated criminal proceedings. There have been no such proceedings to date. For deep interrogation the penalties would probably be nominal and the Crown could stand by the personnel as in civil actions. If the possibility of a more serious penalty such as imprisonment was involved we should resort to an Act of Indemnity on an individual basis. 
The additional note added to the Supplementary material sums this up. 
C.W. Roberts, Esq., Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, 0, Downing Street, ondon, S.W.1.

STATEMENT ON THE PARKER REPORT NOTES FOR SUPPLEMENTARIES 
1. Future of interrogation in depth 
The second sentence might better read "It is only the specific techniques examined in the Parker Report and employed as an aid to interrogation which are to be discontinued." 
As we are saying that interrogation in depth will continue where necessary the next question could be what techniques will be used. So far as the Army is concerned the position is: 
"When the Army is operating in aid of the civil power, the conduct of interrogation remains a matter for the civil authorities. If it should become necessary for 
Army personnel to carry out interrogation in order to obtain intelligence in any future military operations, the methods used would be based on the practice of the civil police in the United Kingdom. The methods to be used in training servicemen to resist interrogation by an enemy are under review." 
2. Use of other techniques in other circumstances 
The reference to paragraph 36 of the Majority Report in the last sentence is unnecessary. Although this paragraph does refer to the use of techniques for the purposes of security and safety the recommendation to issue guidelines was largely in the context of using the techniques for interrogation and this is now overtaken by the Government’s decision. Also we would not want to imply that the Army are concerned with these processes in Northern Ireland. The point could be simply made by saying "Appropriate instructions have been given to the Army as regards wall-standing: persons in Army custody will not be hooded These instructions of course only apply to the Army and leave open the question of the RUC. No, doubt the Home Office will advise in this respect. 
5. Role of the Army in respect of interrogation 
For the reasons that I have already explained to Peter Gregson this morning the references to detention and internment should be avoided since the Army are concerned with guarding internment centres and providing support to the Prison Staff in the event of disturbances in the camps, and at Long Kesh military police are controlling entry and exit. It is necessary only to deal with the point at issue and we suggest therefore that the answer in this case should be confined to the final paragraph of the instruction to the GOC which was discussed at the Prime Minister’s meeting this morning.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
8. Legal protection of Service personnel 
This could give rise to the question what "proper protection" means and whether it would be our intention to seek immunity in all cases, civil or criminal. I have set out the position, which has been agreed with the Home Office, in my covering note and suggest the addition of a further paragraph as follows: 
"The steps needed to protect individuals may vary with 
circumstances. They would not necessarily require the panning of an Act of Indemnity." [IF FURTHER PRESSED: The identity of individuals will be protected and their costs and any damages met by the Crown. An Act of Indemnity my be considered necessary in particular cases because of the seriousness of the charge and the possible sentence. But no such oases ave been brought so far] 
10. Allegations of continuing ill-treatment 
The proper channel for complaints is to the RUC and we would not want to encourage these to be made direct to the GOC where the Army is concerned. 
I suggest the first two 
paragraphs should be amended to read "Complaints about the conduct of the security forces should be made to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. 
If there is a prima facie case of a 
breach of the law a full investigation will be made. The Army always co-operates to the full in such enquiries where this is necessary. 
11. Involvement of SAS Regiment 
No SAS individual or unit has been or is stationed in Northern Ireland. None has taken part in the ’interrogation in depth’ there. 
IF PRESSED: SAS sub-units have visited Northern Ireland 
occasionally (no more than 2 or 3 times since August 1969) for short periods for exercises - just as they visit other parts of the world. The last time was in September 1970.] 
The SAS have not been involved in the evolution of 
interrogation techniques although they are trained in exercises to resist them. 
12. The Moore case 
A background note and a number of supplementaries are provided separately. It is recommended however that the Prime Minister does not get involved in the details of this case. He could reasonably say that the Parker Report dealt only with interrogation in depth and that Moore was held only for 48 hours and then released; and that any questions concerning the judgment should be put down separately on the order paper. There is in fact a question from Clinton Davis for Lord Balniel to answer next week asking what disciplinary action is being taken against the policeman who the judge described as having lied in the course of giving evidence.

CASE OF W J MOORE 
Background Note 1. 
1971 by Servicemen and removed to the Regional Holding Centre Ballykinler where he was placed in an empty hut with others who had been arrested. He was guarded in the hut by soldiers. He was transferred to the Maidstone early on 11 August and released on 24 August. At some unspecified time thereafter, he disappeared over the Border into the Republic whence he has not officially returned. On 13 September, a writ was issued on his behalf claiming damages for wrongful arrest and imprisonment and assault, trespass to the person and battery. 
W J Moore was arrested in the early morning of 9 August 2. The preliminary hearing of the case took place on 2 and 17 
November when the question of the discovery of documents was dealt with. Only one Ministry of Defence document, a Brigade Order less some appendices, was withheld on grounds of security, and the Judge accepted the Secretary of State’s certificate without apparent demur on 17 November. The RUC attempted to withhold a number of documents mainly on the grounds of the need to protect the identity of individuals but the Judge refused to accept Mr Faulkner’s certificate and Counsel appealed against this ruling. 
3. On 22 November the main hearing began, and the Plaintiff 
failed to appear. His Counsel argued that the failure was due to fear of further arrest and that this fear was justified by the fact that "military personnel had made a number of visits to his home.’ Although Moore was wanted by the Police for questioning, this was not revealed to the Judge nor were Moore’s false allegations refuted. In fact military personnel had paid one visit only to Moore’s house in the company of the civil police. An undertaking not to arrest Moore was demanded by Counsel as a precondition of appearance, but the Civil Police naturally refused. The case was adjourned until 22 December when, in the absence of an undertaking to Moore, the Judge ruled that his evidence could be taken in absentia by virtue of a sworn affidavit. The case was reopened on 19 January when Counsel for the Crown gave notice of appeal against both the disclosure of RUC documents and the hearing of the case in the plaintiff’s absence. The plaintiff waived the claim for disclosure and the Judge decided to hear the case. 
4. At the end of the six-day hearing he reserved his judgment 
which was delivered on 18 February. The judgment was that the plaintiff had been wrongfully arrested and detained (due to procedural irregularity) and that he had suffered sufficient in the way of assault, even if many of the allegations of serious ill-treatment had not been proved, to justify the award of the total sum of £300 claimed. This can be construed to mean broadly that the Judge considered the treatment established by the Compton Report by itself to constitute assault as justifying the portion of the £300 damages which was not attributable to wrongful arrest and imprisonment.

(2) USE OF TECHNIQUES IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES DISCUSSED IN THE PARKER REPORT MAY CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR SHORT PERIODS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THOSE OF INTERROGATION WITH WHICH THE REPORT WAS CONCERNED. WALL-STANDING MAY BE USED FOR A SHORT TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING SEARCHED TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ARMED HOODING OR BLANKETING MAY BE USED TO PROTECT A MAN IN CUSTODY FROM BEING RECOGNISED IF HE IS WILLING TO BE CONCEALED IN THIS WAY.

(3) TRAINING OF BRITISH TROOPS. BRITISH TROOPS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE TRAINING TO ENABLE THEM TO RESIST THESE TECHNIQUES IF THEY SHOULD BE USED AGAINST THEM. 
(4) USE OF SERVICE PERSONNEL AS INTERROGATORS. THE RECOMMENDATION IN PARAGRAPH 40 of THE MAJORITY REPORT THAT INTERROGATION SHOULD BE CONDUCTED BY SERVICE PERSONNEL REFERS TO OCCASIONS ON WHICH THERE MIGHT BE A NECESSITY TO USE THE TECHNIQUES AS AIDS TO INTERROGATION. IT IS THUS OVERTAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT’S DECISION THAT THE TECHNIQUES SHOULD NOT HE SO USED. 
(5) ROLE OF ARMY IN RESPECT OF INTERROGATION. INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING RE-EMPHASISING THAT WHILE THE ARMY IS EMPOWERED AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO ARREST PERSONS UNDER CERTAIN REGULATIONS OF THE SPECIAL POWERS ACTS, AND TO HAND THEM OVER TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITY, THE SUBSEQUENT DETENTION, INTERNMENT, OR INTERROGATION OF SUCH PERSONS ARE MATTERS SOLELY FOR THE CIVIL AUTHORITY. 
(6) AUTHORITY OF GOC OVER RUC. REFER TO PRIME MINISTER’S REPLY TO QUESTIONS BY MESSRS O’HALLARAN AND MC NAMARA (OFFICAL REPORT 20 OCTOBER, 1971, VOL 823, COL 142-143) 
(7) LEGALITY OF TECHNIQUES. LORD GARDINER SAYS THAT THE PROCEDURES USED IM NORTHERN IRELAND WERE ILLEGAL. THE MAJORITY REFRAIN FROM EXPRESSING THEIR VIEW IN DEFERENCE TO THE NORHTERN IRELAND COURTS BECAUSE PROCEEDINGS WHICH RAISE THAT ISSUE ARE PENDING THERE. 
IT IS FOR THE COURTS AND NOT fOR MINISTERS TO PRONOUNCE ON THE LAW. 
8) (IF PRESSED) LEGAL PROTECTION OF SERVICE PERSONNEL. E GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO GIVE OPER PROTECTION TO ANY OF THEIR SERVANTS WHO MAY BE THE SUBJECT. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND WOULD CONSULT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ERN IRELAND IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE RUC WERE INVOLVED.

(9) COMPENSATION. ANY QUESTION OF COMPENSATING PERSONS WHO HAVE HAD THESE TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND WOULD BE A MATTER TO BE PURSUED IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND COURTS. 
(10) ALLEGATIONS OF CONTINUING ILL-TREATMENT. COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE RUC OR OF THE ARMY SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OR TO THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING. THEY WILL BE FULLY INVESTIGATED. A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS SENT TO THE AUTHORITIES BY FATHER FAUL AND FATHER MURRAY ARE ALREADY BEING INVESTIGATED. PEOPLE MAKING THE COMPLAINTS WILL BE EXPECTED TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE ENQUIRY. SIR EDMUND COMPTON IS AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF ILLTREATMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ARRESTS MADE UNDER THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT. HE IS PREPARED TO DEAL WITH ALLEGATIONS MADE BY THE AGGRIEVED PERSONS THEMSELVES IN RESPECT OF THEIR TREATMENT WHILE IN THE CUSTODY OF THE SECURITY FORCES BEFORE BEING RELEASED OR HANDED OVER TO PRISON AUTHORITIES. 
(11) MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY. AS THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENCE TOLD THE HOUSE ON 9 DECEMBER LAST, MINISTERS WERE AWARE OF THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING INTERROGATION IN DEPTH, OF THE SAFE-GUARDS AGAINST VIOLENT OR HUMILIATING TREATMENT WHICH HAD BEEN LAID DOWN IN 1965 AND 1967, AND OF THE NEED TO PRESERVE THE SECURITY OF BOTH DETAINEES AND GUARDS. THEY WERE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND THEY KNEW THAT THE DETAINEES WERE LIABLE TO BE SUBJECTED TO A MEASURE OF FATIGUE, ISOLATION AND NOISE. THEY WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE DETAILED METHODS THAT WERE EMPLOYED. MINISTERS ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT WAS DONE 
- JUST AS RIGHT HONOURABLE 
ENTLEMEN OPPOSITE MUST ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT WAS DONE AT RIOUS TIMES IN THE INTERROGATION CENTRE IN ADEN.

to be carried out continuously for long periods both by day and by night with consequent disruption of the normal routine of living. 
9. Where practicable, all persons detained in the Interrogation Centre should 
be seen daily by a Medical Officer and asked if they have any complaints; any allegations of cruelty or torture should be reported at once to the appropriate superior medical headquarters or senior responsible civil or military authority. Medical examinations should be mandatory on admission and discharge (including temporary transfers to or from a detention or other holding centre) and medical treatment available as required. 
The Medical Officer is to maintain a record of each person’s weight as recorded on admission and discharge.

£15,000 a year. The information which came through this source was always 24 to 48 hours delayed and this militated against its usefulness. Moreover, owing to the 
police office system it was never clear from what source their secret information came and no adequate arrangements for criticism by the expert branches were ever made. This of course is a fundamental necessity with secret service. 
It is laid down that lower formations should not control secret service. This 
in so far as informers wore concerned, had to be done in Ireland because as a rule no informer would deal with any but a man he knew. Secret service, properly speaking, did not exist in the country. Many officers believe that, had there been sufficient money available or had a secret service system been started earlier, considerable results might have been obtained. Though it would undoubtedly have been desirable for every intelligence officer to have had more money available for immediate rewards, etc., it is open to question whether money would in itself have made secret service possible ; while had agents been planted five years ago throughout the country they would, assuming the policy as actually carried out not to have been altered, in all probability have become ardent Sinn Feiners by 1920.

(vii) Listening Sets-Microphones and detectaphones were sed to a certain Their value depended on the type of building in which they were situated 
and they were useless in buildings such as wooden huts where every noise was magnified. Consequently, they were not effective in internment camps, but the prisoners believed they were installed everywhere, and this belief greatly hampered the I.R.A. in their attempts to escape or to communicate with their friends outside. 
was hampered by their lack of local knowledge: 
(viii) Interment Camps.-The work of intelligence officers in internment camps This prevented them from 
interrogating prisoners successfully. Some prisoners, however, spoke freely and gave a certain amount of unimportant information. Interns letters were severely censcred by their own leades, and at first contained 
no information of value. As time went on this censorship was relaxed and letters -contained political opinions of some interest but no information. The most important sources of formation were the secret posts, which as they were not interrupted were believed by the internes to be perfectly secure. These letters were particularly useful especially to the branch compiling the-Order of Battle and Irish Republican Army list. 
Intelligence Staff-Military intelligence officers in Ireland were young, enthusiastic and extraordinarily brave and they frequently obtained excellent results by slicer audacity. Many of them developed marked aptitude for intelligence duties and proved themselves to be possessed of tact, patience and intuition. Almost without exception they were very hard workers. They had constantly to tour their areas and went personally -with most raiding and searching parties, because they alone had the knowledge which ensured that raids and searches produced the best.results, and they were in almost constant personal danger, for from the autumn of 1920 onwards, any officer known to be engaged on intelligence duties ran a certain amount of risk when. ever he left barracks. They proved than guerilla war the foundation of military intelligence is the batalion and detachment system and that the best information is that obtained by front line troops.

Sinn Fein Intelligence in Internment Camps. The system in internment cams was practically confined to counter espionage. 
Little is known of it except at Ballykinlar, but then methods adopted in this camp are probably typical. 
The chief fear of the internes’leaders was that secret agents would be used against 
them. To prevent this and for general intellignce purposes the following system was adopted:- 
(a) Censorship ; (b) Intelligence Officers (called agents) ; (c) Scouts ; (d) Reference Department. 
A Chief Intelligence Officer was appointed with four sections under him (a) Censorship - All letters to and from interns were censored in order :- 
(1) To prevent internes friends or relations or interns themselves giving information to the Military Staff. 
(2). To detect any agents or " traitors " in the camp. In the case of outgoing letters anything considered of use to us was deleted 
the letter returned to the writer. Raids were also made on letter boxes to ensure that no attempts were made to evade this censorship. At first it was caried out secretly, but as was to be expected its existence was soon discovered and the leaders then continued it openly. As time-went on however, and, as it was apparently effective, it was enforced only occasionally or against suspected men. 
(b) Intelligence Officers -An Intelligence Officer was selected for each but by 
the Chief 1.0. His duty consisted in watching the other men of the hut and reporting anyone whom he regarded as suspicious. He also made very careful enquiries about the relations and antecedents of each man. Any doubtful men were shadowed so that they could not communicate secretly with our intelligence officers. The investigations about suspected en was very thorough and it is said to have taken seven months to complete, for which reason, it was stated, that no attempts were made at tunnelling until after this period. Men were warned against talking in such a way that information could be obtained through the listening sets which, they believed, were installed in every hut. It was the duty of these I.O.s to lookout for such conversations and report the delinquents. 
Similar intelligence officers were appointed for workshops, hospitals, cook- 
houses, etc. (c) Scouts.-The duties of scouts consisted in protecting meetings from surprise 
visits. They were used also to watch and report the movements of war intelligence officers inside and, if possible, outside the camp. These duties were well carried out and were important when tunnelling was in progress. They made it difficult for our intelligence officers to move about the camp and to interview people secretly. 
(d) Reference Deparment. This consisted of a number of intelligence officers 
from different Brigade areas’ whose local knowledge was used in connection with suspects. In addition to these four sections, electricians were employed to discover 
listening sets.

Following it the draft of a statement to be televised by 
Mr. Faulkner and issued. Begins. 
1. If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things 
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and soial development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of 
good will, however divergent their legitimato political views may participate to the full. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy. 2. 
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry them out. 3. 
Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have such methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. 4. 
I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs. 
5. Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the 
security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing threat to public order and safety. This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the police in respect of each ouch person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

of access to an advisory committee. which will hear representations for release and make recommendations to me. 6. 
I have taken this serious step solely for the protection 
of life and security of property in Northern Ireland. At all times I have consistently emphasised that it was not a step towards which I would be moved by any political clamour. Equally, I cannot now allow the prospect of any misrepresentations to deflect me from my duty to act. 
7. This is not action taken against any responsible and law- 
abiding section of the community. Nor is it in any way punitive or indiscriminate. Its benefits should be felt not least in those areas where violent men have exercised a certain away by. threat and intimidation over decent and responsible men and women. 8. 
The main target of the present operation in the Irish 
Republican Army which has been responsible for recent acts of terrorism, and whose victims have included Protestant and Roman Catholic alike. They are the present threat: but we will not hesitate to take strong action against any other individuals or organisations who may present such a threat in the future. 
9. It is with understandable reluctance that one uses these 
exceptional powers, but the organisations concerned are those which have murdered in cold blood, created situations which have led to death or injury to people quite uninvolved in disorder, maimed numerous people including young children and put at risk the jobs and the whole future of entire communities. I ask those who will quite sincerely consider the use of internment powers as evil to answer honestly this question: Is it more of an evil than to allow the perpetrators of these outrages to remain at liberty? I cannot guarantee that the action we have now taken will bring this campaign swiftly to an end. We may yet have much to endure as a community: but if we endure it with courage and steadiness, the utter defeat of terrorism is sure.

10. That is the aim we must now put before everything also, and for this reason I have also decided that the security forces mus 
not, at this critical time, be diverted from their essentiaL tasks. Because of this, and taking into account also the further damage which any serious public disorder however occasioned would do to commerce, industry and indeed the community as a whole. I have today made an order prohibiting all processions throughout Northern Ireland, with the exception of customary remembrance day parades organised by ex-servicemen’s organisations, for a period of six months. Thereafter I will review the position in the light of circumstances prevailing at that time.

11. I am sorry that this decision will inevitably interfere 
with rights and tradition cherished by many people, but I must ask all concerned to accept it as truly necessary in the vital interests of the country. We are, quite simply, at war with the terrorist, and in a state of war many sacrifices have to be made, and made in a co-operative and understanding spirit. 12. The action we have now taken does not indicate any policy of repression. We are acting not to suppress freedom, but to allow the overwhelming mass of our people to enjoy freedom including freedom from fear of the gunman, of the nightly explosion, of fire-raising, of kangaroo courts and all the apparatus of terrorism. The rest of us cannot truly be free while people determined to commit such outrages are at large. 
13. In particular, I want to say a word directly to my Catholic fellow-countrymen. I do not for one moment confuse your community with the IRA or I imagine that these acts of terror have been committed in your name or with your approval. I have always had great respect for the god-fearing people. Albeit with political views different from my own - I have met in every part of Ulster. I respect the way in which your religious leaders, and many of your public representatives, have outspokenly condemned violence as immoral. We are now acting to remove the shadow of fear which hangs over too many of you. I appeal to you to come out and join us in building this community up again: not to restore it simply to what it was, for many of us in the past have failed each other, but to build it on better, sounder and stronger lines. Unless you take the place in our community which awaits you, all of us will be the losers. My door is open to an y of your leaders, political or religious, who want to discuss how we can now move forward. 
14. Over the last couple of year we have taken many steps to make it clear that we want (following word underlined) all the people of Northern Ireland to play a part in administering and developing the country. But neither changes in law nor changes in administrative structures can unite his community until we

" DLFAUT OTI 32n Dear Attorney 
It and when internment tn introduood it will be necessary to ot without delay under ReaulationA 10 11 and 12 of the Regulations sods under the Civil Anthorities (Speoinal1owro) Aot (il) 1922 (Roprint to 1969). 
In diocusions with the police atan doubts have arisen as to these Regulations. 
The proedure apparently falls into throe steest arreant for purposes of Lnterrogations followed normally by a detention order to coor further enquiries, followed by an internment order where no charges are preferred 
A person arrested will be brought initially to a holding contre where e will be placed in a policescell or Ay guardroon. hero he will be intorrogntod, and tit is proposed to detain hi further a detention order will be applied for, 
for the purpose of intorrogation. to the Army. 
eglation 10 enables the police to arrest and detain a person for up to 48 hours But the regulation givoa no similar poor 
suspects to be put temporarily out of the way during a particular :oyal Visit. It was not drafted as part of detention and internment procedure. 
Furthermore, the original purpose of the Regulation ws to enable Should it, 
therefore, be ignored and Regulation 11 used instead as authority to make arrests? 
If so, oan a peron be interroptod under Regulation 11 ponding the making of a detontion order? How soon should a detention order be applied. ibr? Can he be interroentod thereafter? The purpose of intrrogation is, of coure, to establish the identity of other members of subversive organizationss rather than to aable a oharCe to be preferred against the person interrodntod. 
It is not proposed that 
he should be able to call upon his solicitor until after the period of interrogation. During thin period in he protoctod by the Judges Rules? 
Under Regulation 11(2) a person ay be detained by ardor until (a) he bas been dischared by direction of the Attorney-Geneml or (b) he is brought before a Court of uraarys 
Jurisdiotion. During the 1956--1961 IRA Campaign it waa nomal for an 
intznaant order to be made without either of these latter steps being taken, the result being that the detention order rained undicharged. Would you agree that tbe a detention order is made and it is proposed to follow thin with an internment order, the corroot procedure should be for the person oonoerned to be diaRnd.fto mention by direction of the Attermon eegsg and for sa atenment order to bo wed on him forthwith?

THE ROYAL COURTS OF JUSTICE(ULSTER) BELFAST BT1 3JY. 
22nd July, 1971. Dear Harris, 
Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act 1922 Regulations 10 11 and 12 
1. Thank you for your letter about the above and if any 
further queries arise out of this letter I will be pleaed to discuss the matters further with you or anyone else concerned. 
2. 
Regulation 10 Regulation 10 enables an officer of the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary to authorise the arrest without warrant and detention for a period of not more than 48 hours for the purpose of interrogation. The distinction is made throughout the Regulations between a "police constable" on the one hand and a "police officer" on the other hand and Regulation 10 is therefore wide enough - 
and I think is intended 
to enable a police officer to authorise either a police constable or a member of H.M. Forces to arrest without warrant for this period and for this purpose. It is a valuable regulation and it should not be ignored but it does presuppose a specific authorisation by an officer of the R.U.C. 
3. 
Regulation 11 Regulation 11 enables three categories of persons to mak 
an arrest without warrant in certain circumstances - general 
suspicious circumstances. The three categories of persons are (l) any police constable; (2) any soldier on duty; and (3) any person authorised for the purpose by the Minister of Home Affairs. This Regulation differs from Regulation 10 in that the person arresting must suspect the person arrested of

22nd July, 1971. 
acting or having acted, etc., in a manner prejudicial to the peace or where a document, etc., is found in hi possession. The person arrested may not be guilty of a crime although he may be suspected or it. It must however be remembered in this context that under Section 2(4) of the Act a person is deemed to be guilty of an offence against the Regulations if he does an act "of such a nature as to be calculated to be prejudicial to the preservation of the pace or maintenance of order". This however would not include a person suspected of acting or having acted, etc., within the use of those words in Regulation 11. 
4. 
Can a Person be Interrogated under Regulation 11 pending the making of a Detention Order? 
No specific pwoer to interrogate is given but there is no 
reason why a person should not be interrogated. If he is interrogated in these circumstances and discloses information relating to other persons on which the police can usefully act obviously they can properly do so, but if interrogation in these circumstances brings forth an admission or confession by the person questioned in relation to a crime committed by himself such a confession or admission would be in breach of the Judges’ Rules and, in particular, Rule 3 thereof which prevents the questioning of persons in custody in so far as the admissibility in court is concerned of such evidence. The Judges’ Rules are only concerned with the admissibility at a trial where an admission or confession is mad. They are not concerned with simply what is said by a person questioned in custody but which is not used as evidence at a trial. 
5. 
Does a Detention Order alter the position in 4 above? It does not. The position is the same and a person may be 
interrogated after a Detention Order is made. If he gives information in relation to other persons or even in relation to his own activities this may be acted on but any confession or admission he makes in these circumstances will be contrary to the Judges Rules and will be inadmissible at histrial.

22nd July, 1971. 6. 
How soon should a Detention Order be applied for? There is no guidance under any of the Regulations on this 
question. However Section 132 of the Magistrates Courts Act 
1964 may provide a guide-line. It could be argued In fact that this section applies to a person arrested without warrant under Regulation 11 of the Special Powers Act for the section says: "Where a person arrested without warrant is not within 24 hours of his arrest released from custody the member of the R.U.C. in charge of the constabulary station where such person is in custody shall bring him or have him brought before a Magistrates’ Court as soon as practicable thereafter but, in any event, not later than 48 hours after his arrest". When taken in isolation this section could apply to a person arrested without warrant under Section 11 but I don t think it does because when one reads it in conjunection with Section 131 of the same Act and, indeed, Section 133, it contemplates a person being arrested without warrant for an offence but under Regulation 11 a person may be arrested without warrant who has not committed an offence but who is, for example, only suspected of having committed an offence. However the directions contained in Section 132, even though they may not apply to arrest under Regulation 11, might provide a useful guide-line, and, accordingly, I would suggest that a Detention Order should be applied for 24 hours after a person has been arrested if that is practicable but, in any event, not later than 48 hours after arrest. 
7. 
Should a Detention Order be formally discharged before an Internment Order is made? 
Again, there is nothing in the Regula: which requires his to be done but, on the whole, I don’t think so. Under 
agdlation 11(2) the Attorney-General has power to discharge the arson detained but not the Detention Order. From the practica: d political point of view it would look rather questionable r an Attorney-General to discharge the person and then the vil Authority forthwith to serve an Internment Order on the son. A situation of this kind suggests that one member of government who is concerned with the administration of 
Files\\SKD_round1\\DEFE 24 1214\\IMG_2177_DEFE_24_1214 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

justice feels the person should be discharged and that another member of the government equally concerned with the administration of justice thinks he should be interned. I am then refore not in favour of adopting a practice that a person detained should be discharged by the Attorney-General and then an Internment Order forthwith served on him. 
8. You state that the maximum period of detention "has been 
taken to be 28 days". Where is the authority for this for I cannot find any authority from my reading of the Regulations or the Act? 
9. Generally These Regulations are not very well drafted and any 
difficulties we will encounter in respect of steps taken under them will be due to this. Furthermore, there is a complete absence of legal authorities to aid their interpretation. I don’t think it would be politic at the moment to’ re-draft either Regulation 11 or Regulation 12. 
without any challenge or legal impediment but I feel the situation has changed very much now and this is why I think you are right in exercising care to ascertain what the precise powers are at this early stage. I feel that there are quite a number of people who would be only too eager to test the validity of steps taken under these Regulations 
In practice the police have always acted under them whereas in 
earlier years these powers were exercised without any real challenge.

G ANNEX B TO 43 DATED 7 Aug 71 
1. By virtue of the authorisation given to me by an officer of the Royal lster Constabulary, units of the Brigade are to effect the arrest without warrant of those named in Annex 
for a period of not more than 48 hurs for the purpose of interrogation at a suitable Police Office. 
are suspected of having committed an offence against Regulation 24 A made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922. 
to this order and their detention Those named in the Annex referred to above Under Regulation 11 made under that Act any member of Her Majesty’s 
forces on duty when the occasion for the arrest arises may arrest without warrant any person who is suspected of having committed an offence against the Regulations. 
2. Any member of Her Majesty’s Forces on duty may also, where it is 
necessary for the purpose of effecting an arrest in respect of any crime or any offence under the Regulations made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act Northern Ireland, 1922, exercise, by virtue of that Act, the like powers as may be exercised by a police constable in effecting arrest in a case where an arrestable offence has been committed. 
Under 
Section 2 (4) of the Act, a person shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence against the Regulations if he does any act of such nature as to be calculated to be prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or maintenance of order in Northern Ireland and not specifically provided for in the Regulations. 
3. When arresting a person under this order the soldier making the 
arrest is to say "I am arresting you under the powers conferred by the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act(orthern Irelad) 1922". If the person arrested questions the authority for the arrest eg by asking what offence he has committed or under what Regulation he is arrested the soldier making the arrest is to. say "I am not required to give any further explanation. 
I warn you that if you resist arrest you may be 
committing an offence". 4. 
After the person has been arrested, units are to arrange that the 
soldier making the arrest brings him to the appropriate Police Office and hands him over to a police officer or police constable notifying him of the full circumstances of the arrest in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex B to Part 3 Section 3 of Northern Ireland Standing Security Instruction 1971. 
If it is operationally impracticable in any 
case for the soldier making the arrest to go with the person arrested to hand him over to the RUC the dispensation given in paragraph 4c of the Instruction referred to may be exercised but the greatest care is to be taken in complying with that instruction particularly as regards continuity of evidence.

FOR HOWARD DRAKE 1 
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE VIEWS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
CONCERNING INTERROGATION A CAN A PERSON BE INTERROGATED UNDER REGULATION 11 
PENDING THE MAKING OF A DETENTION ORDER? NO SPECIFIC POWER TO INTERROGATE IS GIVEN BUT THERE 85 IF HE IS 
NO REASON WHY A.PERSON SHOULD NOT BE INTERROGATED. 
INTERROGATED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DISCLOSES INFORMATION RELATING TO OTHER PERSONS ON WHICH THE POLICE CAN USEFULLY ACT OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN PROPERLY DO SO. BUT IF INTERROGATION INN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BRINGS FORTH AN ADMISSION OR CONFESSION BY THE PERSON QUESTIONED IN RELATION TO A CRIME COMMITTED BY HIMSELF SUCH A CONFESSION OR ADMISSION WOULD BE IN BREACH OF THE JUDGES RULES AND, 
IN PARTICULAR, RULE 3 THEREOF WHICH 
PREVENTS THE QUESTIONING OF PERSONS IN CUSTODY IN SO FAR AS THE ADMISSIBILITY IN COURT IS CONCERNED OF SUCH EVIDENCE. THE JUDGES RULES ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE ADMISSIBILITY AT A TRIAL WHERE AN ADMISSION OR CONFESSION IS MADE. 
THEY ARE 
NOT CONCERNED WITH SIMPLY WHAT IS SAID BY A PERSON QUESTIONED IN CUSTODY BUT WHICH IS NOT USED AS EVIDENCE AT A TRIAL. 
B 
DOES A DETENTION ORDER ALTER THIS POSITION? IT DOES NOT. 
THE POSITION IS THE SAME AND A PERSON MAY BE INTERROGATED AFTER A DETENTION ORDER IS MADE. 
INFORMATION IN RELATION TO OTHER PERSONS OR EVEN IN RELATION TO HIS OWN ACTIVITIES THIS MAY BE ACTED ON BUT ANY CONFESSION OR ADMISSION HE MAKES IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE CONTRARY TO THE JUDGES RULES AND WILL BE INADMISSIBLE AT HIS TRIAL. 
2. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS NOT YET GIVEN A VIEW ON 
INTERROGATION AFTER INERNMENT BUT WILL BE ASKED TO DO SO. A NON EXPERT VIEW IS THAT THE POSITION IS LIKELY TO BE THE SAME AS DURING THE PHASE OF DETENTION.

A/BR/20201/19/MO 3 AS (GS) NORTHERN IRELAND 
1. If the pakage deal does indeed turn out to be internment in exchange for a ban on parades for six months coupled with no new rifle clubs, the following thoughts occur to me. 
2. The package deal itself. 
a. Internment. In Whitehall we do not know enough about the list of 520? possible internees. Whose property is this list once Mr FAULKNER requests the deal and HMG agrees it? Who are the Protestants on this list? Accepting that we know the criteria for selection, who has been considered and discarded and why? Is the list of wanted men to be made public once internment is introuced? If not why not, as information about known and publicied wanted men is bound to be more available than about faceless men? 
b. The ban on parades. What does this really mean? How flexible is this ban? Surely there would be merit in preserving some room for manoeuvre for HMG by agreeing in private to a six month ban (subject to review?) but saying in public that the ban is ’until further notice’. This would have a probably good effect on Catholics. If for six months, is the ban until 10 Jan or 31 Jan 72? (NB the last ban was lifted on 31 Jan 71). 
o. No new rifle clubs. This presumably means that rifle clubs which are already reistered can continue. What about those clubs which have applied for registration but still awaiting it? An alarm. ng increase in such applications was reported some weeks ago. 
hopes that ’no new 
rifle clubs’ means’membership of rifle clubs is frozen’, or ’only those rifle clubs already legally registered on 7 Au 71 may continue’; or better still, ’only those legally registered before the flood of applications whatever selected date that might be - may continue’. In effect this measure means nothing. There are reported to be 102 leally registered clubs, and unless membership is frozen, new applicants 
will mearly join existing 
clubs rather than form new ones. Of the 102 legally registered clubs only about 90 actually exist, because club secretaries automatically renew annual applications but the club may be dormant. The actual distribution of clubs throughout the province by Police Divisions is:

3 The most pressing immediate problems are to agrees 
a. The security problem, both in GB and NI especially concerning the move of reinforcements and briefing of RUC 
b. The PR Line, accepting that the opposition have had ample warning to prepare every form of international opposition to internment without trial; and the need to make STORMONT realise their responsibilities in internment. 
c.. The cover plan for the actual op, and the selection of a code word. 
d. The mechanics of the operation 
(i) What is said to the wanted person at the time of arrest? 
(2) The time allowed for a person to make really important domestic arrangements before being taken away. 
(3) The action to be taken in the event of wanted persons attempting to escape. 
(4) The action to be taken if the locals stop the security forces arresting the wanted persons and rioting takes place. 
(5)What action is to be taken if only a very small number of wanted persons are arrested? 
(6) 
We have heard that the IRA deliberately intend to allow an internee with a dangerous heart complaint to be arrested. What medical screening is planned to prevent an immediate complaint of murder or callousness etc? 
e. A clear and unequivocal statement of Home Office policy

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
4. The likely chain of events following the decision to intern on the lines proposed might be as follows 
a. The immediate implementation of the IRA contingency counter plan We have four days in which to expose it - a good challenge to Int. 
b. The mass and immediate exodus from ULSTER to EIRE of the families of internees, attended by the maximum international publicity and the maximum EIREAN public assistance. Mr LYNCH will canel his October visit as a gesture. 
o. The Hightened risk of RC rioting followed by Protestant counter action, possibly leading to a masive urban confrontation and therefore justifying the proposed Force levels. 
d. The period following the rioting, when the IRA realise the disruption to their units and urban sanctuaries in ULSTER. 
e. The consequently increased importance of the EIREAN sanctuary to the IRA, and the appearance in time of ASU flying columns operating across the border against country police stations, magistrates homes, public utitilities, farms etc. 
f. The consequent need for stricter physical control of the border to intercept ASUs and prevent the removal of hostages, wounded etc (there will be kidnapping of local border 
officials) 
g. A persistant NICRA, TM Amnesty International ALJ etc clamour centered on the places and methods of internment, and interrogation and the consequent measures used to protect them not 
only against these threats but against planed gaol breaks, thus leading to penny packeting of the Security Forces. 
h. More active assistance to the IRA from within the sanctuary and from overseas in the form of aid in money and goods, the possibility that the reconstructed IRA will reform 
on new lines and the probability that bbth factions will draw together under new leadership. 
j. An eventual redeployment of the Security Forces, with a change of emphasis from 30% rural 70% urban ops as now, to about 50/50, caused by the need for increased border patrolling. There will be a requirement for the UDR to provide immediate protection for their local areas. At present only some of the rural based companies are permitted to hold their weapons at home. It will be highly desirable to extend this policy to all rural based companies. We must also expect UDR country detachments to be prime IRA targets for arms seizure, intimidation and murder. Pressure to raise the full time UDR unit will mount, but few if any RCs will join it and, if raised the UDR image will suffer B Specials comparison

DRAFT MESSAGE TO THE TAOISEACH I am sending you this message to let you know 
that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland will very shortly be announcing that, in the light of the latest assessment of the security situation in Northern Ireland and all. other relevant factors, and after consultation with the British Government, the Northern Ireland Govern ment has decided to activate its powers of internment so as to enable the security forces to arrest and detain people suspected of responsibility for committing or abetting acts of terrorism and other breaches of the peace designed to lead to a breakdown of law and order in Northern Ireland. 
They will at the same time announce that all marche 
and parades. are banned until further notice. The ban wil be in the first instance for six months, but it, will be made clear that the need to extend and renew the ban for a further period will be considered in the light of the situation towards the end of the period. 3. 
[Any reference to rifle clubs.] You will understand why it is imossible to to give 
notice of a decision to introduce internment before the operation to give effect to it. The security forces havE in fact been carrying out such an operation this morning. When Mr. Faulkner came to London last week, he tolk 
us that he had come to the conclusion that internment was now the right and indeed inevitable course. The late series of acts of terrorism by the I.R.A. and their rec declarations of their intention to continue and even

escalate their campaign have made it impossible for him to resist the pressures on him, not only from his political supporters but from the business community and others whos lives are being disrupted, for more drastic action. 
In 
purely military terms it would perhaps have been possible to hope that the situation could be restored by the means employed hitherto, as I know you yourself would have preferred. But. that would have at best been a long haul, and Faulkner’s judgment was that the consequences of that for the community would be worse than the consequences of what is no proposed. 6. 
That is his judgment of the situation, and of 
course the decision is his, though he has reached it after consultation with us. For our part, we made it clear that there could be no question of our accepting internment, an instructing our forces to help to implement it, if it was riot accompanied by a complete ban on marhes and parades of all kinds; and we have made clear our present view that that ban will need to remain in force as long as internment lasts, though the extension after six months remains formally open for discussion. 7. 
We realise that these decisions carry their dangers 
as well as their advantages for Northern Ireland; and I a well aware of their implications and dangers for you. Clearly the effectiveness of internment in Northern Ireland could have been increased if you had felt able to take similar measures on your side of the border. But I judged from our Ambassador’s report of his recent talk with you that’ there was no prospect of that, and I could not there-

to hold his hand. 8. 
We have however sought to ensure that the measures 
taken do not discriminate as between the different sections of the community, except as the facts of the situation make inevitable. 
Protestant as well as Catholic 
and I.R.A. extremists will be liable to internment and the marches due in Derry on 12 August .and in Belfast at the end of the month will not take place. 9. 
I regret no less than you that these new measures 
have been found necessary. I hope that, in the light of wh I have said, you will be able to react to them with understanding, even if with regret. Our hope. certainly is that they can be strictly: temporary, and will serve to reestalbish a situation in which the many social and other reforms that have been introduced are recognised at their true value, and progress can again be resumed on the task of building more harmonious inter-community relations in Northern Ireland. 
10. And above all I hope that this will not be allowed to affect the good relationship which you and I have established, and the close relations between our two. countries on so many matters of importance to us both: and particularly on entry into the European Communities. 11. I am much looking forward to your visit in October, which will give us an opportunity to discuss the. whole range of matters of interest to us both.

DRAT MESSAGE TO MR. NIXON I am sending you this message to let you know 
that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland will very shortly be announcing that, in the light of the latest assessment of the security situation in Northern Ireland and all other relevant factors, and after consultation with the British Government, the Northern Ireland Government has decided to activate its powers of internment so as to enable the security forces to arrest and detain peoplesuspected of responsibility for committing or abetting acts of terrorism and other breaches of the peace designed to lead to a breakdown, of law and order in Northern Ireland. 2. 
They will at the same time announce that all marche 
and parades. are banned until further notice. The ban will be in the first instance for six months, but it will be made clear that the need to extend and renew the ban for a further period will be considered in the light of the situation towards the end of the period. 3. 
[Any reference to rifle clubs.] 4. You will understand why it is impossible to give 
notice of a decision to introduce internment before the operation to give effect to it. 
The security forces have 
in fact been carrying out such an operation this morning. 5. 
When Mr. Faulkner came to London last week, he told 
us that he had come to the conclusion that internment was now the right and indeed inevitable course. The latest series of acts of terrorism by the I.R.A. and their recent

declarations of their intention to continue and even escalate that campaign have made it impossible for him to resist the pressures on him, not only from his political supporters but from the business community and others whose lives are being disrupted, for more drastic action. In. purely military terms it would perhaps have been possible to hope that the situation could be restored by the means employed hitherto.. 
But that would have at best been a 
long haul, and Faulkner’s judgment was that the consequenes of that for the community would be worse than the consequences of what is now proposed. 6. 
The decision is, of course, Faulkners, since the 
powers under which these measures are taken are powers. of the Northern Ireland Government. But implementation depends upon the co-operation of the units of the British Army in Northern Ireland, and he has decided as he always said he would, after consultation with us. For our part, we have made it clear that there could be no question of our accepting internment, and instructing 
our forces to help to implement it, if it was not accompanied. by a complete ban. on marches and parades of all- kinds; and we have made clear our present view that that ben will need to remain force as long as internment lasts, although the extension after six months remains formally open for discussion 
We realise , of course, 
that these decisions carry their dangers as well as their advantages in Nothern Ireland 
and I am also very well aware of their implications for the Irish Repbublic.

We have sought to ensure that the measures taken do not discriminate as between the different sections of the community, except as the facts of the situation make inevitable. 
Protestants as well as Catholic and I.R.A., 
extremists will be liable to internment; and the marches due in Derry on 12 August and in Belfast at the end of the month will not take place. 8. 
A little time ago, I was in touch with Mr. Lynch 
to try to discover whether he was contemplating the possibility of internment south of the border, if we were forced to. it north of the border. Clearly that would have added to its effectiveness; but out discussions shoved that there was no possibility of parallel action south of the border. 
Have sent a further message tQ 
Mr. Lynch, asking him to react with understanding; even if with regret, and emphasising that we hope that these measures can be strictly temporary, and will serve to re-establish a situation in which we can get back to the task of making progress with building more harmonious inter-community relations in Northern Ireland. I had already invited Mr. lynch to come over here for meetings in October, for a general discussion on the whole range of matters of interest to us both, and I hope very much that that arrangement will be able to stand.

INTERNMENT: NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
I feel you would wish to be aware that the DIS has NO hard 
intelligence that the parade in Londonderry on the 12th is likely to attract any greater terrorist activity than was foreseen last week or indeed at any time in the past before such a parado. 
stepping up trainig in the South this week; 2. In support of the above I can report:- 
a. there is NO sign of any unusual increase in IRA strength (either faction) in Londonderry up to today; nor have we any knowledge of IRA plans to reinforce their units in that city. 
b. Nor do we have any intelligence suggesting firm plans for protestant activity by any extremist group such as the Ulster Volunteer Force. 
3. As recently as 2 August 1971 the Director of Intelligence 
made a formal assessment reporting that if the parade was banned the Protestants would regard it as a major sell-out to the Republicans: there was consequent talk of serious disorders if this should happen. The Director further reported that Republican are publicly advocating the need for plans to be made for "disruptive activity", should internment be introduced. 
4. In sum, I have NO new intelligence indicators to support the view that the Apprentices Boys March is now more likely than we have previously judged to result in danger to life and limb lot alone that it will be a "blood bath". Such a risk as you well know inevitably exists, but there has been nothing over the last few days suggesting any dramatic change for the worse. 
We do know from one CX report that Bradyites may be we do recognise 
that there is a state of increased sectarian tension; but all this is completely true to form in such circumstances.

I ran through a number of possible methods of improving security in Londonderry on 12 August - further reinforcements,

ANNEX A TO Dated 4 Aug 71. 
THE MAIDSTONE - REQUIRMENTS 1. 141 Bulkhead 3 dock level, does not mako a natural barrier as it is open plan 
on this deck at this point. The natural security boundary is at 131 bulkhead, wh the only access to the remainder of the ship is through two watertight doors. It is proposed that this be the limit of the security area and that these doors be me secure by the yielding of hasps for the fitting of padlocks on the forward aide of the bulkhead. 
2. It will be necessary to provide a wire securing strop with padlock to prevent 
exit from 3 deck to 2 dock through the hatch at 151 station on two deck. 3. 
To give access to the recreation area on the quarterdeck from the security a 
of the ship it will be necessary to surround the hatch at 151 station, 2 dock with a wire cage from deck level to the deckhead. This will prevent exit from 3 deck. to the guard areas on 2 deck. A door will be required in this cage which will be 10 x 7 feet in area. 
4. A six foot high barrier of barbed wire will be required around the perimeter 
of the quarterdeck. This is visualised as the recreation area 5. 
Exit from the secure area is possible through some sixty ship side souttles. 
It is not considered feasible to weld bars over these in the time scale envisaged and it is also considered that a requirement exists for the scuttle to be opened for ventilation. In these circumstances it is necessary to cover these scuttles with a barbed wire screen which will cover the side of the ship around this area. The screen can be secured to the coil pipe at the waterlevel and to the quarterde guard rails at the upper deck level. 
6. Six hot lockers will have to be fitted in the senior rates messes between 13 and 141 bulkheads on 3 deck. 
7. Forty 2’6" square tables will be required for dining halls. These are not. available in the ship. All other domestic requirements can be met. 8. 
The messdeck on 4 deck between 131 and 141 bulkheads is envisaged as an 
accommodation space. At present it and the storerooms underneath on 5 deck are fully utilised for storage spaces. It will be necessary to provide a working party of approximately forty to clear these storerooms and restow the contents elsewhere if the time scale envisaged 
to be met.

4th August 1971 NORTHERN IRELAND This is to confirm our telephone conversation this 
morning. The Defence Secretary is content with the substance 
of the Home Secretary’s proposed message to Mr. Faulkner enclosed with your letter of yesterday, subject to the insertion of the words "in present circumstances" between "not" and "recommending" in the first line of paragraph 3. 
I should perhaps add that while endorsing the GOC’s’view 
that internment should not at present be recommended on military grounds the Ministry of Defence entirely accepts that the final decision must rest with Ministers who will have to take into account both military and political considerations. In the light of the GOC’s advice against the banning of the Apprentice Boys’ procession on 12th August the feeling here is that we should postpone any decision about internment until after the march has taken place and we have been able to evaluate thoroughly the desirability and implications of such a decision.

YOUR TEL NOS 146 AND 147. 1. I HAVE TWO GENERAL POINTS. FIRST, MR. LYNCH WILL ONLY INTRODUCE INTERNMENT IF THIS IS JUDGED NECESSARY FOR DOMESTIC REASONS - 
THAT IS, IF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT FEELS THAT THERE IS8 NO OTHER 
MEANS OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER IN THE REPUBLIC. SECONDLY, IF I SPEAK TO MR LYNCH ON PURELY HYPOTHETICAL LINES, AS IN YOUR TELEGRAMS, HIS FORMAL REPLY WILL PROBABLY BE THAT HE CANNOT GIVE AN ANSWER TO A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. HE MAY BE WILLING TO HAVE A CONFIDENTIAL TALK ON HOW HE NOW PERSONALLY SEES THE DIFFICULTIES FACING HIM OVER INTERMENT, BUT HE WILL NOT COMMIT HIMSELF, NOR WILL HIS VIEWS NECESSARILY COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF HIS COLLEAGUES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE IRISH WILL DO SHOULD WE INTERN IN THE NORTH, IN TERMS OF INDiCATIONS WHICH WE CAN USE IN PLANNING OUR OWN INTERMENT OPERATION, I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO TELL MR LYNCH THAT THERE. IS A LIKELIHOOD THAT INTERNMENT WILL BE INTRODUCED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS (OR WHENEVER) AND ASK. HIM, AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS COLLEAGUES, FOR SOME INDICATION OF WHAT HIS REACTIONS WOULD BE ONLY BY CONFRONTING THE IRISH WITH A SITUATION IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS CAN WE EXTRACT A USEFUL ANSWER. 
2. WITHIN THESE LIMITS, I SEE NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCUSSING THIS WITH MR LYNCH. I CAN USUALLY ARRANGE A DISCREET MEETING AT A FEW DAYS NOTICE, ALTHOUGH EVERY HOVE I MAKE IS BEING VERY CLOSELY WATCHED AT PRESENT. WHILE THE ISSUE OF INTERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED AS IT HAS BEEN, BY IRISH MINISTERS, I THINK WE CAN RELY ON HIS DISCRETION ABOUT THIS APPROACH. 
3. IN FACT, I THIHK WE WOULD VALUE BEING CONSULTED IN THIS WAY: AND TO DO IT THOROUGHLY, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHOD AND GO THROUGH VITH HIM (BUT NOT OF COURSE TO RETAIN) A DOCUMENT ON THE LINES OF YOUR TEL N0 147. I WUOLD, HOWEVER, LIKE TO SUGGEST CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO PARA 3. FIRST, I WUOLD LIKE TO ADD AFTER ’’ CROSS THE BORDER’’ THE WORDS ’’ AND ADD TO THE ALREADY RECOGNISED THREAT IN".

THE NEXT WORD ’’ INTO’’ CONSEQUENTIALLY DROPS OUT. THIS WILL BRING OUT THE REAL ADVANTAGE TO MR LYNCH OF INTRODUCING INTERNMEMT IN THE SOUTH, AID THIS IS OUR ONLY POSITIVE ARGUMENT, SECONDLY, I WOULD PREFER TO OMIT ALL AFTER ’’ WHICH THIS WOULD BRING’. I DO NOT THINK THAT MR LYNCH WUOLD REGARD DIRECT RULE AS A DISASTER, ALTHOUGH HE WOULD REGRET ITS. INTRODUCTION. NOR DO I THINK THAT MR LYNCH HAS THE SAME VIEW OR PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE AS MR FAULKNER 
- THE FORMER 
IS ON A CONVERGING COURSE, THE LATTER ON A PARALLEL. BUT IRISH VIEWS ARE COMPLEX. PLEASE EE M.I.F.T. 
4. FOLLOWING ARE COMMENTS ON YOUR TELEGRAM NUMBER 146. (1) WE KNOW THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT HAVE DECIDED ON A TOUGH LINE AGAINST BOTH I R A FACTIONS, AND EVEN IF CONVICTIONS ARE NOT OBTAINED IN COURTS THEY WILL HARASS THEM BY ADMINISTRATIVE 
ACTION. THE MINSTER OF FINANCE REPEATED THIS TO ME LAST SATURDAY, AND ADDED THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOT REPEAT NOT EXCLUDED. IT WOULD, HOWEVER, BE AN EXTREMELY CONTENTIOUS POLITICAL ISSUE, WHICH MIGHT NECESSITATE RECALLING THE DAIL. MR LYNCH WOULD IN ANY CASE BE ACCUSED BY SIN FEIN OF ACTING IN COLLUSION WITH US, AND I DO NOT SEE HOW HE COULD AGREE TO ANY TIMING WHICH WOULD CONFIRM SUCH SUSPICIONS. IT MIGHT THEREFORE BE EASIER IF INTERNMENT COULD BE INTRODUCED AFTER, AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, SIMILAR ACTION IN THE NORTH, I CANNOT SEE HIM AGREEING TO SYNCHRONISED ACTION. BUT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF POINT THAT I COULD DISCUSS WITH HIM IN SECRET. (11) I CANNOT COMMENT ON YOUR POINT A UNTIL I KNOW WHAT THE DECISION IS: BUT IN ANY CASE I HOPE WE CAN LET THE IRISH KNOW IT IN ADVANCE, IN VIEW OF THE EXTEME IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACH TO IT. (III) POINT B. MY GUESS ON THE LIKELY REPLY IS THAT HE IS INDEED THINKING ABOUT INTERNMENT; THAT INTERNMENT IN THE NORTH WOULD HAVE OBVIOUS REPERCUSSIONS IN THE SOUTH BUT THAT HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT THESE ARE BEFORE TAKING A DECISION (IV) POINT D. COULD I BE GIVEN A GENUINE BUT ANODYNE MESSAGE TO CONVEY? I SHOULD ALSO SEER HIS AGREEMENT THAT OUR DISCUSSION ON INTERNMENT IS TOTALLY DENIABLE AND HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE. (V) YOUR PARA 3. I CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THESE POINTS BUT UNLESS I CONCEDE THAT UNIONIST PRESSURE IS ONE AMONG A NUMBER OF FACTORS I SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED.

The Chairman said that the meeting would not be concerned with policy 
decisions about internment but it was noted that any decision by the Northern Ireland Government to introduce internment would require prior consultation with United Kingdom Ministers. 
It would, however, be useful to consider 
what progress had been made with contingency planning. The Northern Ireland Government representatives said that plans were in 
hand but it had not been possible to take them very far partly because of the need to preserve security and partly because it was not possible at this stage to say how many people would be picked up when the plan went into operation. 
It could be anything between 30 and 300. Detention orders 
would be prepared beforehand for each individual who might be involved and these could be signed after arrest, if necessary. 
After a period of

detention, detainees who were not released would become internees. Any 
new draft regulations required for this purpose could now be prepared for immediate signature if and when the need arose. 
Rules for the internal 
administration of internment camps had been drafted but there was some uncertainty about powers to interrogate on which the advice of the AttorneyGeneral was being sought. It was confirmed by the military representatives that a list of between 
325 and 375 names had been drawn up by Special Branch and that 20-40 per cent of these sight be involved in the initial operation. 
The broad plan for 
military aid to the civil power for the machinery of detention was in existence but it was agreed that more detailed planning could be done without widening significantly the number of person involved. 
One of the matters 
still being looked into was the provision of sufficient accommodation for the immediate post-detention situation. 
the schee, for use as a fall-back if necessary. 
HMS Maidstone was till a part of The Army were working in 
co-operation with Special Branch of the RUC to asses how many interrogators could be required for the post-detention period, and it had to be accepted that these might well fall short of the ideal number. Membership of a review tribunal was raised. 
A panel of names was 
already in existence but it was suggested that the chairman or perhaps one other person might be nominated by the Home Office. 
Mr Howard-Drake agreed 
without comitment to examine this. It was agreed that the public relations aspect of internment would be 
important and that it would be helpful to draft statements on a contingency basis. 
International interest in internment would be such keener than on 
the previous occasion on which they were put into effect in Northern Ireland, and public announcements would have to be aimed at three audience, vis Northern Ireland, the rest of the United Kingdom, and internation opinion.

The subject of staffing was discussed and details were given of a 
orthern Ireland Government plan to close the open prison at Castledillon, bringing prisoners back to Crumlin Road jail. staff would be released for duty at Long Kesh. 
In this way, 60 prison This would probably result 
in a short-fall of 30, half of which it was hoped would be found by overstaffed existing establishments, while the other 15 might be found from retired police or prison officers. It was agreed that an essential part of the contingency plan would be The initial pick-up would take 48 hours and immediate accommodation 
timing. 
for 80 could be found in Crumlin Road prison at a few hours’ notice, and for others at Armagh prison, possibly within 48 hours. 
It would take 
2 - 4 days to close Castledillon, and 14 days to construct an outer perimeter fence at Long Kesh, although this did not mean that Long Kesh could not be used before then if the number of military guards was temporarily increased. It was agreed that the Northern Ireland Government should acquire the 
premises at long Kesh from the inistry of Defence on a rental basis, the figure to be assessed by the district valuer on a commercial basis. 
It was 
likely that maintenance would be carried out by military personnel, partly because of the security difficulties involved if civilian labour were used. Accommodation stores might be left behind by the Army but this was a utter which required further consultation between the Army and the Northern Ireland Government. Summing up, the Chairman said that it would be desirable to make immediate 
progress in producing a draft contingency plan containing as much detail as possible without running a risk of leaks. 
This was agreed and a further 
meeting was fixed for Friday, 20th August at which draft copies of the plan would be made available for examination.

Dublin REF BELFAST (Personal) M.I.F.T. contains draft of the be made KREP Belfast asking Mr. Lynch to introduce 
internment in the Republic in parallel with action by HMG, should we decide that the security situation in Northern Ireland requires this step. No decision on this point has been made. Our present thinking in regard to timing of n approach is based on the following points: (a) If decision on Apprentice Boys March in Derry on 12 
August does not fully

(b) Since chances of a favourable response by Mr. Lynch must be small, we want to make the approach in such a way as to minimise the risk of the approach and his response becoming known and jeopardising action in the North. 
(c) Approach should therefore be mad, in first instance, on a hypothetical basis, mentioning no dates and leaving final decision to be made in the future.

We should be grateful for your comments on the any suggestions that 
you would like to make on method. and timing of approach. You will wish to consider particularly reference to the value of internment as a contribution to averting a move to direct rule 3. 
You will see that emphsis has been put on the 
security arguments for the introduction of internment. Fact is of course that there is very strong pressure within the Unionist Party in the North upon Mr. Faulkner to take this further step and this is factor in situation. You will have to be. prepared to refute any suggestion by Mr. Lynch that this pressure would be regarded by Mr. Faulkner or HMG as adequate to justify a decision in favour of internment . You can point to the other steps for which right-wing Unionists have been pressing, namely a much less tightly controlled policy on the use of firearms by the British Army and the setting up of local groups of vigilantes who would. take the law into their own hands, and describe how Mr. Faulkner is fighting off both kinds of proposal..

Northern Ireland: Discussion in the Home Secretary’s Room on Monday, 19th July, 1971

withdrawal of one major firm could start an exodus. Ministers in the Northern Ireland Government favoured internment. 
Some, perhaps most, of the Mr. Smith’s, 
assessment was that internment in Northern Ireland would upset the IRA but would’ not prevent their carrying on their activities. 
If internment in Northern 
roland could be accompanied by internment in the Republic the political, difficulties would be largely overcome and the effectiveness of the action greatly increased. 
Mr. Smith suggested that a ajor effort should be made to 
persuade the Prime inister of the Republic to adopt internment. A special emissary might be sent to Dublin. Mr. Smith said that short of internment it was possible to consider 
restricting the moveent in Northern Ireland of undesirable persons, such as Brady. 
Brady had recently come to Northern Ireland to address a ncetin. The Special Branch had not told the army that they wanted to question him and he

be banned. 
General Tuzo was asked whether he thought the.Apprentice Boys’ March should He said that he thought it would be easier to have a controlled 
march than to attempt to ban it. There was a risk that extreme Protestants 
would come out or to .tho streets and perhaps use the rifles they had hidden away.. Mr. Smith suggested that if the activity of the army as in proposed swoops could be presented as a major now drive against the IRA it might be possible to call upon the Protesants to give up their march without too drastic a reaction. General Tuzo agreed that the question of banning should be considered again closer to the occasion. The Home Secretary said that Mr. Faulkner had suggested the cratering of 
roads on the border. General Tuzo said that this was a waste. of tie. Any farmer with a bulldozer could fill in the crater and such measures had no security value to balance the ill-will they created amongst the border population. If, however, it were thought politically desirable, blowing holes in roads was technically not a difficult operation for the army. 
Mr. Smith stressed that 
although cratering might temporarily please Unionist opinion, views would change hen it became apparent that cratering was ineffective and the security forces ould be open to ridicule. 
The Home Secretary said that, although the security 
advantages might be meagre, this appeared to be a matter to which Mr. Faulkner attached political importance and he found it attractive for that reason. General Tuzo mentioned that it was intended to put a stronger charge behind The Home Secretary said that he had been disappointed that 
rubber bullets had not been more effective and welcomed the proposal to give them greater impact. General Tuzo said that he found the HBC utterly u n he lpful, much worse than They lest no opportunity to sneer at the army;

We spoke yesterday about a forthcoming meeting with representatives It has been agreed that the meeting 
should be on either Thursday or Friday of next week, but I am waiting for those representatives to suggest a time and day and as soon as this has been fixed I will get in touch with you again.

be discussed are as follows:A Costs The construction costs are being met by the Ministry of Defence and 
presumably there will be no change in this arrangement until and unless arrangements are brought into force to use the premises concerned.

(b) the Northern Ireland Government to buy the premises but to pay 
rent for the land; (c) the Northern Ireland Government to rent the premises and land 
a figure which could include maintenance. The questions arising from these alternatives are:(i) would any figures include an element for military labour invo 
in capital works? (ii) if (a) is decided on, would there be a requirement to give the 
Ministry of Defence first refusal if and when the premises should no longer be needed?

1. 2. You will recollect that we spoke together briefly about the 
attached references. On reflection I feel that we must give the matter more thought. 
I suggest that any reply should be on the lines that:a. 
with only the minimum Army support and supervision, (which, if it is not a joint operation, should in fact be deniable). 
b. 3. The methods used should be such as to allow 
HNG to endorse them as publicly acceptable if forced to do so. 
However, you may feel that a more comprehensive reply is not 
possible without additional information, such as:a. b. 
What are the actual methods proposed? What exact degree of supervision/support will 
be required from the Army? c. 
What are the intelligence benefits of keeping 
the interrogation process quiet? d. 
Northern Ireland view point? 
4. I have no doubt that the interrogation process will be the subject of intense public scrutiny. Various organisations like Amnesty International will go out of their way to see that it is. It may behove us therefore to accept internment and interrogation 
as a joint RUC/mil operation from the start and inform HQ Northern land to plan it accordingly. I think it is the firm steer which 
HQ Northern Ireland is lacking. Given this, they can be left to work out the details. But they need to answer some of their own questions first. 
I suggest that you, Col MSI(OT) and I meet to discuss our broach. You may wish to elevate it to AU8(GS)/BGS(Int)/DMO level?

LONG KESH III - ADDITIONAL FACILITIES FOR VISITORS Reference A: A/57/Engrs 6756(Engr 1A) dated 1 June 1971 
1. 2. Despite paragraph 4 of Annex A to Reference A, it has been necessary to agree with 
Home Office that there is a requirement to increase the facilities for visitors at present planned in Hut 11 (Dwg No 62/39/7 refers). 
It has therefore become necessary to alter the layout of Hut 11, retaining the 
"Identification" and "Search" rooms (for marshalling visitees) and the visitors toilets, but converting the rest of.the area into visitor cubicles as indicated on the amended drawing enclosed. This will provide 21 cubicles, as opposed to the 7 on the present plan. 
3. To compensate for this, it will be necessary to erect a further 24’ x 66’6" Nissen 
as a Reception Centre, which must provide the some facilities as the present Hut II but without the visitors section. The "spare" space could be obsorbed by two further rooms on either side of a central corridor, or alternatively by shortening the building (See sketch attached). 
4. The suggested portion of the new hut, provisionally labelled "11A" is shown on 
Drawing 62/329/1 attached. It is necessary to run in electricity water and sullage drainage only; we suggest that placing sinks back to back, and using a raised trap outide the building will solve the problem of fall and a connection can be made to manhole 
16 (see Dwg 62/329/23) without recourse to major alterations to drainage levels. Small bore drain pipe (2" Dia) would be acceptable, since the sinks will have strainers fitted. Casting of the hut base will not involve drainage ducts and should be done as part of the current contract. 
5. 
It is understood that one additional but has been "found" locally, so that the new "11A" will involve only internal fittings, and service connections additional to the 
present stores lists. 6. 
In terms of priorities, it is essential that Hut 11A is available for use 
immediately Phase III is completed; Hut 11 should therefore take lower priority, but both should be completed desirably as part of Phase I (leaving out the actual cubicle partitions in Hut 11 until Phase III is ordered). 
7. Please agree that this work can be undertaken, and arrange for drawing, stores 
lists, and pricing to be produced. Please also indicate what effect this alteration a have on completion dates for Phases I and II.

Internment I think these two papers set out the position 
sufficiently for your Minister. They refer to pronouncements made by Messrs Chichester-Clark, Faulkner, Heath and Maudling. 
I think the Home 
Secretary’s views given in the House on 6 April 1971 should be regarded as authoritative and the brief as background information.

Detention and Internment 
The power of internment is contained in Regulation 12 made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts (Northern Ireland) 1922-43, 
The power to 
intern is such criticised and is inconsistent with the European Human Rights Convention; a notice of derogation was lodged in 1957. 
The powers contained 
in Regulation 12 were last used during the IRA campaign against Northern Ireland front 1956-62. 2.

in-point at present. 3. 
Regulation 11 confers powers of deention and in practice further action to intern or to charge under criminal legislation It is not thought that these powers are much 
whether he was contemplating the use of internment powers. 
Before his resignation Major Chichester-Clark was asked from time to time The standard reply 
which he evolved was that his security advisers - the GOC and the Chief Constable- 
did not recommend it at the time, but if they were to recommend it he would not hesitate to act. Since he succeeded as northern Ireland Prime Minister Mr Faulkner has confirmed that this is his view on the introduction of internment. The Northern Ireland Government has a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before making a final decision. 
of internment lay in the hands of the Northern Ireland Government. 
Mr Heath said in Edinburgh on 27 arch that the power It had 
often been stated by Stormont spokesmen, he said, that such measures as internment can only be taken if the Joint Security Committee advises it, but Mr Heath said his Government had never been asked to sanction such a measure. 4. 
On 4 December 1970 the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice of the Irish 
Republic issued a statement about their readiness to reactivate powers of internment without trial in the Republic because of information about plans for a secret armed conspiracy. 
The statement added that the Republic also had 
lodged a notice of derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention on human Rights. 
But little has been heard from the Republic of any steps to carry out the threat or of the alleged plot behind the move.

W F Stout Esq CB GOvernment Security adviser Stormont Castle 
Thank you for your letter of 27 April about providing accomodation in the event of certain measures being put in hand in Northern Ireland. I as sorry the reply has taken so long but you will be glad to know that in view of the difficulties you described, the ministry of Defence have agreed to finance the construction of the accomodation for the time being. 
I understand that work has already started and that it there are no delays or difficulties, accommodation for around 150 person will be in existence by the end of August or the beginning of September. 
Perhaps you will find it useful if we could arrange another meeting to discuss the terms on which Northern Ireland would use Ministry of Defence property if it proves necessary to do so and the other consequential arrangements such as staffing. I believe the possibility of a further meeting between the ministry of Defence, yourselves and us was envisaged at the meeting here on 16 April and we shall be glad to arrange for another meeting either here or in Belfast on a convenient date. its you already know, Jack Howard Drake has taken over this subject from Robin North and he will make the necessary arrangements.

LONG KESH III Ref As Meeting held by DS6 in Whitehall Buildings on 25 May 1971. 1. 
The completion dates for Long Kesh III were discussed with 62 CRE and CRE 
N Ireland at a meeting here on 26 May, and the following forecasts agreed. These are based on the assumption that the squadron will be able to be fully deployed on the task by 1 July 1971. 
a. Phase I Completed by 11 Sep 71. This allows 60 working 
days and is based on a 6 day week. b. 
Security for Phase I Will take 14 days to complete. This 
could run concurrently ith Phase I if a decision to implement Phase III is given early enough. 
c. d. 2. 
Phase II Completed by 13 Nov 71. Based on 6 day week. Will take 14 days to complete. 
Completion of Phase III 
This again could be concurrent with Phase II. Work should be completed by 30 Nov 71. 
Implementation of Phase III could cause difficulties with contractors, which 
would delay completion of Phases I and II. This is especially critical over the base laing and the EBNI contracts. Phase III should not therefore be implemented or announced earlier than necessary or without reference to the construction plan.

R North Esq Home Office Whitehall SW.1. 
25 May 1971 1. Thank you for your letter of the 21 May about internment. You 
will probably by now have seen Lord Carrington’s minute to the Prime Minister. I have discussed the practical arrangements which need to be put in hand and I am pleased to say that work will begin on it

September for Phase 1 of the camp if it is required for internment i.e. an accommodation for around 150 people with the necessary security fencing, etc.

should have discussions about any further contingency planning which may be required. 
comments. We propose to make ad hoc arrangements during the course of construction to provide extra "boxes"; and, provided the number of internees is well below the 450 for which the camp will cater. there will be no problem in providing a separate hut for visitors. Should at any stage there be overcrowding in the camp, as Chambers has pointed out, there is space for an extra hut in the camp layout. But we would prefer not to go to that expense, unnecessarily, at the present time. 
In completing the plans we have taken into account Mr Chamber’s 4. You may think that the next steps will bet be for you to brief 
your successor and to suggest to him that he has a briefing session on internment at some early stage which could also be an opportunity for a general review of Home Office/Northern Ireland Government/ 
Ministry of Defence plans. D. A. NICHOLLS giving a likely completion date of end August/beginning

The Plan 2. 
Confirmation had been received that the plans and layout catered 
adequately from the Intelligence point of view with the requirement stated and the Home office were generally content with the proposals. The Prison Department had raised the question of the number of visiting "boxes". It was agreed that the plan should not be held up on this account, but that extra provision of "boxes" should be, if possible. arranged during the course of the camp’s construction and an alternative but identified as a Reception Centre if necessary. The Royal Engineers units should be instructed accordingly. 
Other Items 3. 
Q Ops and Plans will examine this as necessary in conjunction with Q(Maint and E-in-C. It was agreed that the costs of Long Kesh should include the small extra coats for the build at Belly Kelly.

It was agreed that action could be put in hand straight away to In the light of the above, it was agreed that arrangements could 
be put in hand straight away to send an advance party to Northern Ireland. ASD 2 and NO 3 would make the appropriate arrangements to notify. The precise timing of the departure of the Field Squadron would be left between STARTCO and HQ Northern Ireland. 
6. on the basis of a start on 1 June, and in accordance with previous 
assessment, it was estimated that Phase 1 of the build should be complete by about mid-August. If the accommodation were required for internment purposes, it would be necessary to add another 2/4 weeks to the estimate to allow the erection of fencing and watch towers.

It was agreed that MO and PS6 should produce a note on this, drawing on the plans which were in the process of completion in Northern Ireland.

POSSIBLE INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND At your meeting at the end of last month to discuss 
Northern Ireland, it was agreed that the Home Secretary and I should have further discussions with the object of finding funds for the construction of a camp at Long Kesh which could be used to house internees if it were decided to bring in internment. 
2. It is clear that the Northern Ireland Government are 
precluded by practical difficulties from contributing to the project, at least at this stage; and the Home Office have no authority to finance such accommodation in Northern Ireland. I am a little hesitant about whether it is appropriate to finance it from Defence Votes but, given the importance of making a start on the camp as quickly as possible, I would not wish to spend further time on looking for other ways to fund it. 
3. I am therefore giving instructions that the necessary 
financial arrangements should be put in hand for the project to be paid for, at least initially., out of Defence Votes. I hope the work can begin by the end of the month.

NI 7/79/05 D/DS.6/7/153/44/17/2 21st May 1971 You wrote to me on 7th May about internment and subsequently sent 
over the plans of the Long Kesh camp for our comments and those of our Prison Department. 
Reception Centre (hut 11). 
Chambers, of our Prison Department, has queried the plan for the be plan shows only seven "boxes" for visitors 
to speak to internees through a partition. While he was in Northern Ireland with the reconnaissance party, Chambers pointed out that the number of such boxes should represent roughly 10 per cent of the total number of internees. We cannot be sure just how full the internment camp would be if it ever had to be used, but it would seem that provision will have to be made for 30 - 40 "boxes". 
Chambers would prefer to see visiting facilities provided in a 
separate but (at present they represent only one-third of the area of the reception centre) and there would appear to be room for an extra but in the camp layout. This of course means more cost. 
Two minor points which struck us were the descriptions of buildings 
11 and 7. Presumably these will be otherwise described at a later date and it was simply the planners’ intention not to confuse us at this stage. 
With regard to the provision of custodial staff, I am afraid that I 
can say no more than that the Northern Ireland Government have accepted the need to provide internal custodians and are considering ways in which they can provide the staff when the need arises. 
May we retain the plans for the camp? D. A. Nicholls Esq.

INTERNMENT CAMP - NORTHERN IRELAND 
US of S (Army) has seen the attached minute from AUS(GS);*he understands that the Secretary of State has so far been reluctant to agree that Defence Votes should bear the cost of providing accommodation for an Internment Camp in Northern Ireland even though we may be able to use it for other purposes appropriate to the Ministry of Defence. 
However, he feels that the arguments in AUS(GS)’s minute for accepting that the cost might fall, at least initially, on the Ministry of Defence are strong enough to justify going ahead with the project on this basis. 
In particular, he feels that the ability to use The Royal Engineers will make this a comparatively inexpensive undertaking and he recommends that the Secretary of State should write to the Prime Minister on the lines of the draft provided.

INTERNMENT CAMP - 1. NORTHERN IRELAND At a meeting to discuss Northern Ireland affairs under the 
Prime Minister’s Chairmanship on 27 April it was agreed that it would be wise to prepare suitable accommodation for an internment camp. 
It was noted that the Northern Ireland Government agreed 
with HMG in Westminster that a site at Long Kesh was the best choice for this purpose: and that it was desirable for an alternative use for the accommodation to be found. 
The meeting 
invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Defence, to seek, urgently, means of providing funds for the construction of such accommodation at Long Kesh (1). 
2. Ireland Government. 
The Home Office have had further discussions with the Northern Given that the real purpose of the accommoda- 
tion must not be divulged in public, the Northern Ireland Government have confirmed that they can see no way of overcoming two 
major difficulties: first, defence is a reserved subject under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and the financing by the Stormont Government of accommodation for troops would be unconstitutional: secondly, authority for expenditure of the order envisaged, or any attempt to get round the constitutional position, could not be concealed and would almost certainly lead to public debate in Stormont. 
At the same time, the Northern 
Ireland Government recognize our difficulties: they have given assurances that if internment were introduced, they would see what financial aid could be given and in any case would pay rent for the camp; they also recognize their responsibility to provide the custodians and domestic services required in the event of internment. 
3. The Home Office themselves have no authority to finance any 
prison accommodation outside Great Britain; and the Department of the Environment could not act as agents for them, or for any other body, without there being proper and legitimate authority so to do. 
4. Even if it appeared possible to find a way round these 
difficulties, it is clear that they could not be resolved speedily. We must therefore reconsider the grounds on which, at least initially, Defence votes could provide the funds for the camp.

5. The possible grounds are two-fold: the potential need fo 
an Internment camp an an instrument of the fight against terrorism to which both HMG and the Stormont Government are 
committed; and the alternative use of the buildings as accommod tion for British troops. 
6. As to the first point, it is almost inconceivable that a 
decision to intern would be taken by the Northern Ireland Government without consultation with HMG at Westminster. 
Like 
Major Chichester-Clark, Mr. Faulkner has stated that he would only contemplate internment if the Security Forces advised in favour of it. 
But in any event, to retain under the full control 
of HMG in Westminster the premises necessary if internment is to be physically put into effect, both in the short term solution (Maidstone) and the long term (Long Kesh), is a powerful means of ensuring that the Westminster Government retains a major, if not indeed a predominant, role in such a decision. 
situation the decision to intern would of course lie with the Westminster Government alone. 
7. The second ground - troop accommodation - needs to be examined 
against the background of current and projected force levels and the means of housing them. While long term force levels are postulated at 5 major units in the infantry role (all subsequent calculations in this submission are on the basis of infantry requirements), medium term requirements have been estimated at 10, with a possible need to increase this level to 12 or more for particular periods 
- e.g. the marching season. 
direct rule would probably increase the force level requirement significantly. 
approved, this would be likely further to increase the overall accommodation requirements. 
8. To meet these requirements there will be permanent accommoda- 
tion for 4 accompanied major units by June 1971, when the Army take over the RAF accommodation at Ballykelly; permanent accommodation for a fifth, unaccompanied, major unit is planned for completion (at Aldergrove) by the end of 1972. 
9. generally of a temporary nature. 
The rest of the accommodation, available or planned, is It includes the old barracks 
at Armagh and assumes the continued availability of the accommodation ship MAIDSTONE. 
While it includes modern huts of temporary 
construction, it excludes two hutted training camps which are essential to the training needs of the large garrison and for the UDR and TAVR. 
in disused factories, hangars the Long Kesh site - 
At the bottom end of the scale troops are living - there is such accommodation at 
and, at times of peak force levels, tents.

with and inappropriate to a camp designed primarily as living accommodation for troops. 
the accommodation available at present, and that likely to be required or requisitioned in the event of an increase in force levels beyond those envisaged in the medium term. 
The site plan, and type of construction, is incompatib It is, however, superior to much of

11. Moreover, the use of Royal Engineer resources and labour enables the accommodation to be provided quickly and cheaply. Latest estimates still envisage a building time of around months: the costs are likely to be less than the £185,000 previously forecast. 
scales for a battalion would be likely to cost around £0.5m and take it years to complete. 
A custom-built temporary camp at recognized Ita provision would probably be at 
some detriment to other Army works projects in Northern Ireland. 12. It should be added that: 
(a) to authenticate the cover story, it is essential that the camp should be seen to be performing its secondary role; it will therefore need to be occupied, as much as possible, by British troops; 
(b) the project will be completed substantially under RE auspices and will therefore not impede, nor be at the expense of, other Army works projects in Northern Ireland; 
13. The essential points which emerge from this re-appraisal are: 
(a) So long as internment is regarded as a course which may become necessary, HMG in Westminster, and through them the Service element of the security forces in Northern Ireland, have a joint interest with the Stormont Government in the proper provision of internment facilities; 
(b) this interest would be exclusively the concern of the Westminster Government in a direct rule situation; 
(c) in the light of the continuing high force levels in Northern Ireland in the foreseeable future, and of the indifferent living conditions which some units have to endure, the Ministry of Defence have a separate though related interest in the accommodation which an internment camp, while vacant, would provide: 
(d) disregarding the possible needs of a full time UDR battalion, 
the camp would replace indifferent accommodation 
for a Regular Army battalion elsewhere and otherwise supplement the accommodation at present available in Northern Ireland. 
There is no doubt that, if not required for 
internment purposes, the camp could be immediately occupied by troops and thereafter constantly and fully used. 
14. S of S is therefore invited to agree on reconsideration that there is a good case for the Westminster Government’s assuming financial responsibility for the project at this stage at least, and in particular, for the cost falling on the Ministry of Defence. Though at the expense of less urgent items, funds could be made available from Defence votes. 
15. If S of S agrees, he may like to write to the Prime Minister on the lines of the attached draft.

to contribute to the project, at least at this stage; and the Home Office have no authority to finance such accommodation in Northern Ireland. 
possible, I see little profit in trying to find any other way round the impasse.

financial arrangements should be put in hand for the project to be paid for, at least initially, out of Defence Votes. I hope the work can begin bythe end of the month.

INTERNMENT 1. 
We are still looking here at ways and means of getting financial 
authority to make a move on the internment camp, without prejudice to the possible assistance which the Northern Ireland Gvernment may be able to give later. 
2. In parallel we are seeking to complete the arrangements for 
the actual building of the camp. On this count I have now obtained the plans which the RE will be working to. They are substantially the same as those which I believe were shown to you at the meeting you held with Mr Stout, but it may be helpful for you to see them so that you can confirm that you have no further questions on the layout and construction as. such. Could you please ensure that your colleagues in the Prison Dept see the plan so that they may give us a similar confirmation. I should be very grateful if you could arrange this as soon as possible. 
3. 4. 5. As to the Cabinet Office interest, I have talked to Brian Stuart 
and he is satisfied that, provided our own Int boys have seen and discussed the arrangements with the necessary people in Northern Ireland, there is no further need for him to be involved.-

the aim was to take stock of our current state of readiness and invited the Head of DS 6 to explain the current political situation. 
ITEM I CURRENT SITUATION 2. Mr Nicholls said that the Home Secretary in 
consultation with the Secretary of State for Home Defence has been invited to seek urgently a means of providing funds for the construction of Long Kesh. The Secretary of State for Defence is very reluctant for the funds to be found from the Defence 
Budget and the Home Office is approaching the

without precedent and we would have to admit we do not know the answers. 
The GSO1 M03 said that these were problems Hear of DS 6 asked for 
copies of the plans of the camp which he would send to the Cabinet Office and the Home Office (for the Prison Department). 
ITEM 2. 
Cost and Time 5. 
CONSTRUCTION The Chairman asked for the latest estimates of 
cost and time for construction. 6. 
Cost. Lt Col Wheatley (62 CRE (Construction)) 
replied that the cost is still estimated at between £150,000 and £180,000 depending on whether the Northern Ireland Electricity Board agreed to provide a supply of elect icity. This seems likely at present. 
7. Time. He added that the estimated time to 
complete construction remained at six months from the time authority is given. This estimate would remain the same if the construction was completed in phases. Phase 1, providing accommodation for 150 men would take 60 working days. Phase 2, the completion of the accommodation would take the remainder of the six months, Phase 3 (security fencing) would take two weeks and would be undertaken after the contractors had finished, by RE labour to be provided under CRE Northern Ireland arrangements and control. The Chairman said that we should act on the firm assumption that the camp would be built in three stages.

9. The provision and movement of engineer stores 
for the project is to be dealt with by Engineer Plans. 
10. Lt Col Wheatley said he would like to discuss the construction with a representative of DOE as soon as possible at Barton Stacey, since DOE help would be needed irrespective of which department finally paid for the camp. Head of DS 6 agreed to arrange this visit. 
ITEM 4. DOGS 
11. In reply to a question by the Chairman Lt Col Wheatley said that accommodation for dogs was incorporated in the plans. Dogs were already used in the Long Kesh area and it might prove possible to draw on this source initially. In the longer term it is hoped that the RUC would take on this responsibility and handlers could perhaps be trained at the RAVC centre at fairly short notice. 
ITEM 5. FIREFIGHTING 
12. Arrangements for firefighting are to be found from military resources, and are included in the costing. 
ITEM 6. MA ID STONE 13. CRE Northern Ireland has set aside the small 
quantity of fencing stores needed should the short term measure for internment using the MAIDSTONE be required. 
ITEM 7. COVER STORY 
14. The cover story for the project is that an additional camp for a major unit is to be built. If the unusual configuaration of the camp is commented on it is to be explained that this may have to be used by RAOC or REME as part of the Long Kesh IV Project. 
ITEM 8. INTERROGATION CENTRE 
15. Lt Col Madsen, DI 16, raised the question of whether the cost of the interrogation centre would be included in the cost of the internment camp. This cost is estimated at £2,000 including £1,100 for fencing. CRE Northern Ireland said that the construction costs could be met from his resources, and the meeting agreed that the fencing stores would be held available with the

NORTHERN IRELAND - 1. INTERNMENT When the Ministerial Committee on Northern Ireland examined the 
joint MOD/Home Office paper on Internment (1) on 17 March, they agreed (2) that a reconnaissance party should review, on the ground, the possible internment sites which had been put forward. 2. 
The party, which included MOD representatives of the Dockyard 
Department, the Director of Quartering, the Royal Engineers, and a Home Office representative from the Prison Department, have now reported. Annex A summarizes their findings. The Findings 3. 
The reconnaissance has confirmed that Long Kesh is the most suitable 
long term site. Accommodation can be provided there which would serve either as an internment camp for up to 450 male and female internees of different persuasions and up to 100 custodians with all necessary facilities. If in the event it were not needed for this primary purpose it would provide emergency accommodation of a reasonable standard for use by a battalion. It could be built in such a way that the external signs of its use as an internment camp 
- for example, guard towers and corrugated iron fencing - could be left for erection only when this 
use was intended; and that the internal facilities required in this event 
an alternative legitimate designation. 4. 
- e.g. reception centre, refractory cell block - could be given For the most rapid completion, quickly assembled material would 
have to be used and military manpower employed for most of the construction. Even so, and assuming a smooth work flow, the complete camp would still take about 6 months to complete from the time that approval was given. However, construction can be phased to ensure that a viable camp to take around 150 internees and their custodians could be complex in about 2½ months.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
At a preliminary order of cost the materials would be around 
£190,000, though the bulk of the costs would be for stores which could be drawn from Service sources. About £75,000 worth of these stores would be recoverable if the requirement for the camp lapsed. 6. 
First estimates are that the military manpower required would be 
one Field Squadron of Royal Engineers with some additional specialists. These could be made available from Great Britain. The penalties are that an overseas exercise would have to be cancelled and the interval between successive tours in Northern Ireland by Army Strategic Command RE units would be reduced. 7. 
The Home Office (Prison Department’s) advice is that the accommoda- 
tion would be defensible on humanitarian grounds. The proposed arrangements will however be examined in greater detail and any necessary changes reflected in the design. (The examination will also cover the associated problem of privileges). Arrangements for an interrogation centre are being examined separately. It is considered that this should be set up, separately from the camp, in a suitably modified existing building of brick construction. 8. 
In the reconnaissance party’s view, the best short term solution 
is MAIDSTONE, the accommodation ship in Belfast harbour. It is concluded that this could be made available at 48 hour notice to take up to 150 internnes with the requisite guards. Once internment had been introduced and the need for secrecy no longer existed, it would be possible to bring workmen in, to protect vulnerable services in the forward part of the ship so that within about two weeks, nor it would be possible to move the internees to a more secure area and increase their numbers to about 300. Other facilities could be arranged ad hoc. None would be satisfactory for more than a few weeks however. The case for going ahead now 9. 
It is apparent, that the make-shift arrangements which are necessarily postulated by a short term solution would be far from ideal from

security point of view and would probably be tolerable for no more than a month. As they involve using facilities at present used by or earmarked for British Servicemen, the arrangements would also adversely affect the quartering position at a time when accommodation is likely to be at a premium. 10. It is therefore considered that it would be a prudent precaution to start work on a new camp as soon as possible: a. 
to ensure that a properly secure camp, with living 
conditions about which there would be no legitimate grounds for complaint, is available, if required, with the minimum of delay; b. 
to avoid aggravating Service accommodation problems. 
11. While the latest assessments suggest that the numbers interned, at least on the initial "grab", might be far less than 450, it is considered that it would be prudent to continue to plan for a higher figure; from a Service accommodation point of view this would be most sensible, too. Consultation with the Northern Ireland Government 12. Consultations with the Northern Ireland Government have so far been limited to a discussion on sites. The RUC (Special Branch) are aware of our proposals for Long Kesh and have supported them. Ideally it would be helpful to have further consultations to confirm our preference for Long Kesh and discuss such outstanding issues as the provision of custodians. If planning on the arrangements for arresting internees is to be continued, further discussions with the RUC will be inevitable. 13. some Office to advise on acceptability/unacceptability of discussions with Northern Ireland Officials/Ministers at this stage. The acceptability of doing so has to be weighed against the disadvantages of delay. Is there likely to be any objections in going ahead in any case?].

ANNEX 
SUMMARY OF RECONNAISSANCE PARTY’S FINDINGS A. 
LONG TERM SOLUTION 1. The disused airfield at Long Kesh provides the most suitable 
location, convenient to Belfast but away from populated areas, and with a military presence close by. The best site would be where two old runways intersect, giving a solid base on which to build. Accommodation 2. 
The proposed layout is: a. 
For internees 5 separate compounds, 4 holding 100 each 
and 1 holding 50. This would provide for segregation by types as well as by sexes if required. (It would be intended to build the 50-capacity hut as women’s accommodation). b. 
house up to 100. 3. Cells, recreation rooms and spaces, reception and visitors’ rooms 
and other necessary facilities would need to be built, as part of the camp. An interrogation centre, however, should be housed outside the camp area and could be an existing building suitably modified. 4. 
For Custodians A separate complex of buildings which would All the facilities for the internees and their custodians can be 
designed to double for Service accommodation so that the camp can be used for that purpose. For example, the custodians’ facilities would be based on a design for officers’ and senior NCO’s messes of battalion size, and could be used as such. Layout and Security Arrangements 5. 
The internees’ accommodation should be laid out withn two 
perimeter fences, the inner one of chain-link, the outer faced with corrugated iron. Dannert wire should, in addition, be laid between the two fences and/or guard dogs could patrol it. There should be at least one guard tower at each corner of the outer perimeter fence (which would form a rectangle approximately 1000’ x 550’). These towers

would be equipped with flood lights. Military patrols (including dogs) should operate outside the outer perimeter fence. A Tannoy alarm system would be required for the whole camp. Materials 6. 
For quick erection, readily available and speedily erected 
materials are required. Twyneham huts are considered suitable for the custodians’ accommodation but Nissens which are stronger and less easily damaged are recommended for internees. Construction 7. 
Arrangements can be made through D.O.E. with a local contractor 
to lay concrete foundations. Once these have been laid, the rest of the construction can be carried out by R.E. personnel. Time and personnel required 8. 
The concrete foundations would take one month to lay. Thereafter, 
provided all materials are on site, the rest of the accommodation could be ready in about 4½ months. To achieve this requires a fully Field Squadron as well as specialists. The job would not be achieved more quickly if most troops were deployed: it would however significantly be longer if it was completely let to civil contract. 9. 
The work can be carried out in two phases: a. 
Phase I - b. internees (and the relevant number of custodians) 
camps - 2½ months c. 
lay all foundations and accommodation for 150 - 3 months 
Phase II - The rest, less final conversion to internment Phase III- final conversion - 2 month

heating should be electric; sewage by normal flush toilets.

Secrecy 12. The materials for the perimeter fences and guard towers, in prefabricated form, could be stored ready nearby in a hangar, they could be rapidly erected. The camp would in other respects appear to be a battalion’s living accommodation (see also para 4 ) and should not in itself arouse suspicion. Standards 13. The standards of living and recreation space and other amenities are considered to be adequate and defensible but will need to be confirmed. The question of privileges needs further examination. Custodians 14. The provision of staff for inside the prison needs further examination but any decision would not affect the proposed design and layout of the camp. The numbers provided for 
- 100 - are 
considered to be more than adequate. B. SHORT TERM SOLUTION Bally Kinler 15. The week-end training camp there was investigated. It provides suitable accommodation for internment but its situation (it is near the sea, access roads and wooden areas) is poor from a security point of view. The area is one in which there has been extremists activity: two of the huts in the camp have been blown up in recent months.

16. Maidstone which is berthed in Belfast (Sidenham) was considered 
by the team to have good accommodation. The problem was to make this accommodation sufficiently secure within the ship. The problem here is aggravated by the fact that no work could be done on the ship beforehand without serious risk of revealing the reason for it. 17. The solution recommended is that no more than 150 internees should be placed in the ship in the first instance. Provided the numbers do not exceed this level, and proper arrangements are made to keep them under surveillance, then they should not be able maliciously to damage the ship to any serious extent. 18. Thereafter and once internment had been announced, workmen could be brought in to protect vulnerable services in the forward part of the ship to enable a more secure area to be prepared and to increase the numbers of internees up to 300. Adequate facilities (for exercising, visiting, medical services, etc) could be made ad hoc in MAIDSTONE in a short time. The ship would be available for internees after 48 hours (this gives time for the Army to move out from its accommodation and the Navy to make preparations). Externally there is already a high standard of protection against attack. 19. The advantages of MAIDSTONE are: a. 
it provides fairly secure accommodation without preparation 
almost immediately; b. 
Bally Kinler. 
20. The first advantage above is probably over riding, but the disadvantages of MAIDSTONE are: a. 
it can only take 150 internees immediately. b. it would be unsatisfactory for internees for more than 
about one month. c. 
it would provide internees accommodation at the expense of Army requirements. it is more easily guarded externally and internally than

LONG KESH CAMP Many thanks for your letter. 
I, too, am concerned 
at the delay in getting a decision to go ahead with Long Kesh Camp. 
The latest position is that there 
is a tiresome argument between MOD and. the Home Office as to which of them should pay for it, and no action to build it can start apparently until this argument is resolved. 
We have made it quite clear to all concerned that there is considerable urgency to get a decision over this and I very much hope that next week we shall get one. I shall be away until the end of the week and as soon as there is any progress I will get AUS(GS) to let you know..

DRAFT SUBMISSION - INTERNMENT CAMP Reference: 1. D/DS 6/7/153/44/17 dated 24 Mar 71 We would like to treat the possible establishment 
of an Internment Camp and an Interrogation Centre as two seperate, although related, issues. 
For this reason I recommend the following amendments to your draft submission: 
a. Delete last 4 lines of para 7 starting with word "Arrangements" 
b. Insert new para 8, which should read: "Arrangements for an Interrogation Centre are being examined seperately. We do not consider that it should form any part of the Internment Camp complex, but be located elsewhere.. Present suggestions are that the Interrogation Centre could be set up in a suitable modified existing building of brick construction". 
2. For your information the RUCSB is in fact now pressing 
ahead with the establishment of an Interrogation Centre.’ We are advising them on the control and conduct of the operation of such a Centre and may also have to provide some of the supporting specialist staff and, in conjunction with the Security Service, the technical aids. Actual interrogation will be conducted by RUCSB personnel, in aid of this we will be running a course for the RUC at the Intelligence Centre during the period 16

NORTHERN IRELAND INTERNMENT CAMP - DRAFT SUBMISSION 1. When BGS Headquarters Northern Ireland visited me yesterday I asked 
him how far discussions with the RUC on internment have gone. He replied that the only contact had been with the Special Branch, primarily to ensure that their list of potential internees is up to date, which it is not; and to discuss the interrogation centre. 
2. I attach at Annex A a few comments on your draft submission which 
I think covers a complex subject very comprehensively. I do however feel that the case for a rapid ministerial decision to allow the constructions work to start soonest would be strengthened by reference to the inevitable world-wide interest in the living conditions, and circumstances to be afforded to internees, which would not perhaps be as good as they should be until the proposed Longkesh camp is built. 
3. I think you could also justify the immediate preparation of a 
long term site by emphasising the unsuitability of any of the short term solutions, of which the Maidstone is the most acceptable. 
4. Attached at Annex B to this minute are my comments on Annex A of your draft submission. 26 Mar 71

NORTHERN IRELAND Further to my note of 19 March (not to all or necessary), 
Mr Matthews and Captain Cook have returned from their visit to Belfast where they considered MAIDSTONE’s suitability as an internment ship pending the construction of more permanent arrangements ashore in Northern Ireland. A copy of their report is attached. You will see that this reinforces the view which we have already given to the Army Department that the MAIDSTONE is not really suitable for this purpose. However, if it proves necessary to provide secure accommodation without arousing suspicion that internment regulations are about to be brought into force, then MAIDSTONE could be used, at 48 hours notice, to provide reasonable accommodation for up to 150 internees with the requisite guards. The naval personnel aboard her would continue to provide hotel services but would have to shift their presently held accommodation. The advice is that provided the number of internees does not exceed this level, and proper arrangements are made to keep them under surveillance, then they should not be able maliciously to damage the ship to any serious extent; nor should they be able, by their own folly, to put at risk other internees. 
2. As soon as the intention to intern had been announced it would 
be possible to bring workmen in - probably from Harland and Wolff to protect vulnerable services in the fore part of the ship so that, within about two weeks, it would be possible to move the internees to a more secure area and increase their numbers up to about 300. This should provide adequate accommodation for the matter of weeks which it would take to provide accommodation ashore. The Army authorities in Northern Ireland who were associated with the examination are satisfied that they could arrange for exercises, visiting, interrogation and medical services on an ad hoc basis for the comparatively short period while the MAIDSTONE would be used for this purpose. They and the naval divers already provide a high standard of protection against external attack.

3. On ourrent form it seems unlikely that internment regulations 
will be introduced in Northern Ireland in the immediate future. However, the visit which our experts have paid indicates that the MAIDSTONE could, if necessary, be used at short notice as an interim internment vessel and it is assumed that you will have no objection to the Army Department taking account of her availability in their contingency planning. They would, of course, have to rehouse most of the battalion which was using the MAIDSTONE as an accommodation ship at the time. If you agree, you may wish to send a short note to US of S(RN) on the lines of the draft attached. Thereafter you may like to notify VCG8.

DEBRIEFING LIEUTENANT COLONEL M.B. MCNABB Q2f(A) MEMBER OF THE Q QUARTERING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNMENT CAMP RECONNAISSANCE PARTY 
Introduction 1. Colonel McNabb returned from his reconnaissance in Northern Ireland 
on 17 March and I debriefed him on the afternoon of 18th. He made the points set out in the following paragraphs. 
2. Maidstone. The reconnaissance team looked over Maidstone, together with 
the Home Office representative,and concluded that it would provide satisfactory short term internment accommodation. They thought that it would not be useful for longer than one month. HQ Northern Ireland were content that they could make adequate security arrangements, but would like a Naval export to be briefed by the Home Office and then to visit and inspect Maidstone to advise on any internal work which may or may not be necessary before it could be used for internment. 
3. Maidstone remains and is confirmed as HQ Northern Ireland’s most suitable 
short term solution. 4. 
for internment, but its situation - 
Ballykinler. The camp at Ballykinler provides suitable accommodation (it is near the sea, access roads 
adjacent to UDR camp, and wooded areas) - 5. is most unsutiable for internment 
use. The Home Office expert was most unhappy at the idea of using the camp, two huts of which have been blown up in recent months. 
Longkesh. The reconnaissance party found a most suitable site adjacent 
to Longkesh 1 Camp where runways and taxi tracks provide good hard standings for the erection of a camp. Unfortunately this site is just within the area reserved to a meteorological station and there could be some difficulty in using this area because of possible interference with the radar instruments. This problem is now being investigated by Colonel McNabb and it is thought it can be overcome. 
6. There are a number of problems which require clear Home Office instructions before the final design of the camp can be completed. These are:- 
a. Status. The present terms of reference state that internees should be treated as convicted criminals. The Home Office official was most unhappy with this definition and believed that there would be humanitarian pressures to provide for creature comforts. Home Office guidance is urgently needed to say:- 
(1) The space to be allowed for each prisoner. (2) The maximum number of prisoners per hut. 
(3) The provision of bed lighting and provision of curtains. 
(4) Whether visits by families are to be allowed, and if so under what conditions i.e. regular visiting hours daily. 
b. Cells. The reconnaissance team believe that at least six 
cells would be necessary and are including these in their plane, and-also that it would be necessary to provide an

interrogation centre. These points need confirming. c. 
(1) The size of camp staff needed for a mixed camp of 450. (2) How these would be provided. 
d.. Women Prisoners. The reconnaissance party were advised by Director of Intelligence that they might expect up to 50 women prisoners and the plans being drawn up include provision for women. 
e. Segregation of Types. The team were advised that it 
would be desirable to provide for the segregation of prisoners by type i.e. IRA, Protestant extremists, etc, and have included this in their plans. This will, of course, increase administrative difficulties. 
f. Dogs. The recce party are including a kennels and 
accommodation for 12 guard dogs and their handlers on Home Office advice. It is not clear who will provide these, and this requires looking into. 
g. Fire Fighting. The nearest fire brigade to the site is 
at Lisburn. This is run on a volunteer part-time basis. Provision is therefore being made for the accommodation of trailer fire fighting equipment to be operated by members of the camp staff. Home Office advice is needed as to the minimum requirements within the camp itself. 
h. Alarm Systems. The Home Office expert advised that 
a Tannoy system should be provided for the whole camp. Home Office confirmation in this is needed. 
Construction Time 7. 
The engineer first estimate is that the camp for 450 could be built by 
three field troops all free to work (i.e. not tied to provision of or accounting for stores), in three months from the work go. This would include time to move stores to Ireland. Thus internment accommodation could be arranged as follows:- 
a. Short Term. Maidstone following whatever work is 
advised by the Naval engineer for the first month, during which time construction at Longkesh would be started. 
b. Medium Term. The construction at Longkesh would be 
so arranged that accommodation would become progressively available. After one month it might be possible to start moving internees from Maidstone to phase one of the camp construction. This would provide accommodation for the second and third months after the decision to intern was taken. 
Camp Staff. Guidance is urgently required as to.

INTERNMENT CAMPS POSSIBLE SITES 
Assumptions 1. 
a. b. 450. 
General Points 2. 
of a site: a. 
The following general points are relevant to the selection Time. There may not be much time to make arrangements. 
Accommodation which can be made secure quickly may, at least in the short term, be more acceptable than facilities which have other advantages. On the other hand the more time there is, the easier it will be to carry out adequate planning and complete satisfactory security measures. 
b. Secrecy. Preparations may have to be kept secret both 
for political and operational reasons. Planning for internment is bound to create considerable political and public interest and concern; by keeping plans secret the security forces may have a better chance of gathering the right men in the net (but see para 4 below). 
c. Cover Story. If preparations reach the actual construe 
tion stage and secrecy remains paramount it is clear that some cover story would need to be devised. Some sites will lend themselves better to this than others (but see para 4 below). 
d. Security. An ideal site must be both secure enough to 
prevent escape from inside and also secure and preferably remote enough to reduce the chances of an attack or liberation raid from outside. It should be away from politically sensitive areas both to avoid aggravating public feeling and. reduce the chance of large scale demonstrations; 
e. Size. It has been assumed that up to 450 internees 
would need to be accommodated. Any variation on this figure could affect the selection but particularly if a very much smaller number were to be interned; 
f. Duration. Conditions which might be acceptable for a 
very short term detention might not be acceptable if internment went on for a long period. 
The legal status of internees would be no better than 
that of convicted prisoners (under the Special Powers Act it is conceivable that they might be worse); 
The numbers to be interned could amount to as many as

g. Political Involvement. 
wish to consider how far they are prepared to associate themselves with controversial measures taken by the Northern Ireland Government. In itably the security forces would be involved to some degree; but there is a difference between assisting in rounding up and guarding internees and providing a Service facility for an internment site. 
Ministers in Westminster will 
Great Britain and the Isle of Man 3. 
On Home Office advice the use of Great Britain either in 
terms of prisons or other accommodation or even the use of a Great Britain anchorage has been ruled out because legislation at Westminster would be required to enable internees to be accommodated in this country or in its territorial waters. (under existing law prisoners in Northern Ireland can only be transferred to prisons in Great Britain at their own request) The Isle of Man has also been ruled out: not only would legislation in Northern Ireland end the Isle of Man be necessary, but any scheme would also need prior discussion and agreement with the Isle of Man Government, which is highly unlikely to be forthcoming 
Naval Vessels 4. 
The MAIDSTONE, which is at present serving as an Army accon. 
modation ship in Belfast. is on the spot and the most obvious choice. There are, however, certain other ships which could be used. For example, the cruiser BELFAST has served as a Reserve Fleet accommodation shin and could be used to house up to 500 people in bunks; the MANXMAN is also available and could accommodate rather less than half this number. 
5. The Army could, in an emergency, evacuate MAIDSTONE in about 
48 hrs. The other ships mentioned above would take about three weeks to be prepared and towed to Northern Ireland. Any ship would need a suitable alongside berth with power supplies and other essential services from the shore. 
6. 
The use of a naval vessel raises the following problems: a. 
any ship chosen would need a suitable alongside berth 
with power supplies and other essential services from ashore Only in Belfast, where security problems are likely to be especially difficult, is this degree of support likely to be available; 
b. Electrical leads, fire and water mains and valves run 
throughout the ships both in alleyways and many compartments and it seems likely that only by "enclosing" the internees within a complex of wire grills would the internal safety of the ship be assured. 
c. 
time would be required to take the ship to a dockyard in order to effect the necessary modifications. This is likely 
As well as the planning work that this would involve, to take at least a matter of weeks.

d. Clearly the removal of MAIDSTONE from her present 
berth for the purpose of carrying out such work is likely to attract comment. It would in any case be difficult to preserve security once a ship was taken into dockyard hands and the nature of the work became known. 
e. Even if adequate internal security arrangements can be 
made a ship’s external structure remains vulnerable. f.

practical alternatives. Both islands would require a good deal of work to be carried out on them to provide accommodation (both for internees and their guards) and communications facilities. This would be bound to attract public comment and it would be impossible to keep the true reason for the work from becoming known. (Note: recent military visits to Rathlin Island have already led to public speculation whether an internment camp was being contemplated there).

be needed, although certain buildings would have to be strengthened. 
a. Magilligan WETC. This camp is close to DONEGAL by 
water and the IRA attacked a gun post at MAGILLIGAN by using boats from DONEGAL on 24 Oct 57. Nevertheless the site is fairly remote from land contact with the border. 
b. Ballykinler WETC. During Autumn 1969 it was used by 
a reinforcing battalion, and for security reasons wire and guard towers (since dismantled) were placed round the perimeter without exciting public interest. They would need refurbishing and thickening but this could be done unobtrus. ively particularly if a detachment was living in the camp The adjacent ABERCORN Barracks could be used to accommodate guards and prison warders and provide amenities such as medical cover. The existence of the regular garrison there would be both a deterrent and insurance against any attempted ingress from the area. However: 
(1) the huts are wooden and might be burnt down by the internees; 
(2) the adjacent ammunition sub-depot increases the security problem; 
(3) although the camp is fairly remote, the local villages have Republican leanings and it would not be difficult to arrange an ’escape pipeline’ to the south 
c. Long Kesh. This would be geographically very suitable. 
It is not situated in sensitive area and is easily accessible from the M1 Motorway to BELFAST and other areas where internees are likely to be apprehended. 
11. These camps are earmarked as accommodation for reinforcing units. All would be needed if force levels in the Province were. 
required to be increased to 15 battalions this requirement might arise in the circumstances, or as a result of the circumstances in which internment was authorised. 
12. The advantages of using any such camp would be: a. 
very quickly; b. 
c. d. the camps are already in being and could be improved 
proximity of other military facilities and units; security arrangements could be strengthened to receive 
internees under cover of providing measures to provide greater military preparedness; 
alternative use for either military accommodation or internment would be cost-effective

above. 
14. New sites. The last disadvantage could be overcome if authority were given to build an additional camp to house up to a battalion. This would best be done within, or close to, an existing army camp: Long Kesh appears the best choice. Very rough estimates are that such facilities might be built in a crash programme by Royal Engineers in a month, or by civil contractors/Public Works Department in four months. 
5. The advantage of such a build would be that it should be possible to incorporate security measures more effectively in any new construction work. 
16. Alternatively, and if there were time and there was no serious problem about covert planning it would be possible to establish a. special camp using existing civilian facilities in a politically. and geographically suitable area such as the Protestant part of North Antrim. For example, a factory 3 miles east of Antrim was used by a reinforcing unit until October 1970. This factory has now been sold and it is unlikely that it could be requisitioned, but it is just possible that a similar kind of site might be obtained.

MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON NORTHERN IRELAND INTERNMENT 
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Defence Regulation 12 made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts 
(Northern Ireland) 1922-43 confers on the Northern Ireland Government the power to intern without trial. The power to intern is much criticised and is inconsistent with the European human Rights Convention but in the course of the I.R.A. activities of 1956-62 a notice of derogation was in 1957 lodged in Strasbourg. 2. 
Internmnt has been used in the past against I.R.A. activity both 
North and South of the Border. In response to recent demanded for internment the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has said that if the security advisersthe G.O.C. and the Chief Constable of the R.U.C. 
should be used he would not hesitate to act. But the Northern Ireland Goverment have a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before making a final decision. 3. 
- recommend that these powers The Government of the Irish Republic have announced their readiness 
to reactivate power of internment against conspiracies to kidnap prominent persons and the Government of the Republic recently lodged a notice of derogation with the European Commission. 4. 
At present the demand for Internment is not vociferous, but continuing 
interest may easily produce a climate in which the northern Ireland Government feels compelled to press us to agree to it. The considerations against internment are:(a) it would be politically damaging internally and internationally; (b) there is no certainty that all dangerous men could be identified; 
Files\\SKD_round1\\DEFE 24 1214\\IMG_2299_DEFE_24_1214 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

5. 
(c) other not at Present active or identified would come forward from North or South of the Border to replace tho internees and recruitment to the I.R.A. generally would be stimulated; (d) the sympathies of the minority would rally to the I.R.A. The arguments in favour of internment if the present violence con 
tinues or grows are:(a) whatever unknown I.R.A. sympathisers there may be, there in reliable intelligence about the disposition, if not specific activities, of a member of dangerous men; 
(b) the normal processes of investigation, detection and trial are obstructed by a wall of silence created either by intimidation or sympathy (but those Metropolitan Police C.I.D. may have more succes in getting evidence). 
6. If internment were decided on, its effectiveness would largely depend 
on moving with the least possible advance warning. the contingency study which we authorised has shown that the only practical place of internment would be a military camp in Northern Ireland. Existing prisons are overcrowded, ship could too easily be sabotaged and transfer to Great Britain would require legislation here. 7. 
Two camps in Northern Ireland could be considered. The first, at 
Ballykinler ould be brought into use more speedily but has disadvantages as a long-term camp. The second, at Long Kesh, does not have existing facilities (e.g. a perimeter fence) and while its situation Is to be preferred in the long-term, considerable structural work would be necessary. This additional work could be carried out within the existing resources of the Army and can be plausibly represented as providing accomodation for Army reinforcements. We have approved an immediate reconnaissance of both sites and subject to its findings we recommend that the Northern Ireland Government should be consulted in confidence. This is the more necessary

cretion and not in accordance with any constitutional convention. 
So as to make as little chance as possible in the structure of the Government of Northern Ireland, the persons appointed Ministers by the Governor will be sworn members of the Northern Ireland Privy Council. Subsection (4) deals with regulations to be made under the Special Powers Act. At present these regulations may be made by the Minister of Home Affairs; under this subsection they must be made by the Governor in Council and (see the Schedule) any regulations the Governor makes are to be subject to negative resolution at Westminster. It will be desirable as soon as possible to consider replacing the Special Powers Act by corresponding legislation at Westminster, but in the interim period, it seems necessary to rely on existing legislation, which confers most of the powers likely to be required in the short term. Subsection (5) enables the salary and allowances of the Governor to be increased in view of his increased responsibilities. Subsection (6) deals with the Parliamentary procedure for Orders in Council which will take the place of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Its effect is that:(a) any Order may, if it is desired, be the subject of an affirmative resolution at Westminster; 
(b) if not the subject of an affirmative resolution, it is subject to negative resolution procedure; 
(c) Orders in Council levying taxation are to be the subject of affirmative resolution, but as some tax changes have to be imposed suddenly, they may take effect immediately.

ANNEX A TO DOIC/200/INT DATED 7 JUL 70 
General and Political 1. 
The sombre events of the past fortnight have demonstrated anew the intractable nature o the problem in Northern Ireland - the suspicion, fear and hate 
which divide the communities and lead their more militant members into orgies of blind, destructive rioting. 
Once again the major disturbances occurred in 
Belfast and Londonderry (although the causes differed in the two cities) and in the areas where Protestants and Catholics live their separate lives in crowded enclaves. 
tension increased and there were comparatively minor confrontations and incidents. 
2. On the political side the period under review has seen the reaffirmation by 
the new Conservative Government at Westminster of the bipartisan policy of support for the Chichester-Clark Administration in Northern Ireland with its unqualified commitment to implement the reform programme outlined in the joint communiques of last autumn; the provision of adequate funds to enable the Province to develop economically; and a renewal of the assurance of a continuing British military presence in Northern Ireland for as long as conditions make it necessary. 
These 
assurances were given by the Home Secretary during his brief fact finding visit to Belfast on 30th June and 1st July, and were 
confirmed in the debates which 
followed at Westminster on the Queen’s Speech. 3.

Unionist back-benchers exerted pressure 
in the Administration for more energetic enforcement of law and order. Responding to this dismay in their own ranks the Administration rushed through a bill at Stormont providing for mandatory sentences of imprisonment on persons convicted of riotous conduct - 
there had been legitimate concern felt over the 
trivial sentences imposed by some Courts for participation even in major riots. 5. 
The Catholic leadership both political and ecclestiastical have reluct- 
antly accepted the need for Government to reassert its authority by dealing condignly with law breakers, although many of them in public associate themselves with the outcry against the severity of the Army’s action. 
inevitably, there have been cases of distress among the innocent and there have been renewed accusations of partiality from the Catholics.

Arson and looting accompanied the fighting and reached a climax on the Saturday night with the firing of two large warehouses, the looting of several shops, two pubs, a liquor warehouse (with the help of a bulldozer) and the pillaging and wrecking of the Bogside building site, which will mean the temporary cessation of the building programme at a time when the end of the housing problem was in sight.

The General Election has to some extent diverted attention from Eire 
where the Prime Minister, Mr Lynch, still seems to be firmly in the saddle. Public opinion in the South was hopeful of a Labour victory in the British General Election and is naturally disappointed that the Conservatives, who are identified with the Unionists in Northern Ireland, succeeded.

generally considered that a Labour Government in London would be more likely to consider negotiations with the South for a United Ireland.

Moreover, in the present

From the UK point of view an early statement of the new 
Government’s policy regarding Northern Ireland, coupled with an announcement regarding the reinforcements being made available to help preserve law and order during July, would undoubtedly help to reassure the fearful and to act as a deterrent on would-be troublemakers.

ANNEX A TO DOIC/200/INT DATED 17 AUG 70 
Political and General 1. 
The fortnight has been punctuated with violence and tension and there was 
intensification of the political activity, reported in the last assessment, which developed in the Unionist Party following the Northern Ireland Government’s ban on marches and the outbreak of Catholic rioting both in Belfast and, later, in Londonderry. 
2. On 5th August, three backbench Unionist MPs, the hardline Captain Mitchell 
and Messrs Burns and West, the latter being a member of the dissident group expelled from the Parliamentary Party, called for the Government’s resignation and this demand was echoed two days later by William Craig, another expelled Unionist who emerged, after a period of absence from public life on medical grounds, as the leader of the right-wing backbench revolt. 
This extreme 
Protestant faction demands, as part of a tougher policy on law and order, the re-arming of the RUC, the recall of the USC, and the possible use of the power of internment under the Special Powers Acts. 
While the revolt against the 
Government’s reform policies gathered momentum, fanned by an enormous volume of Press and TV coverage, and as Major Chichester-Clark prepared to face an important meeting of his local constituency association at South Derry, the Home Secretary issued a statement on 10th August. 
He warned that any departure 
by the Northern Ireland Government from the reform programme would endanger the present constitutional arrangements for the administration of the Province, a scarcely veiled threat of direct rule from Westminster. 
3. Although in a press conference Major Chichester-Clark was careful to say 
that direct rule was not a course he would welcome, the Westminster statement does seem to have been of some help to the Stormont Government in getting Unionists to face up to the political realities, and in a confused situation a motion of no confidence put forward at the Prime Minister’s constituency meeting was not carried. 
Next day, 11th August, the Northern Ireland Cabinet met. All 
members of the Government, including junior Ministers and absentees on holiday, were consulted and were associated with a statement committing the whole Administration to firm support for Major Chichester-Clark and to implementation of its reform policies in accordance with the continuing mandate of the Unionist Parliamentary Party and of Parliament. 
As pointed out in the JIC (A) Special 
Assessment of 11th August, this effectively repudiated Mr Craig’s claim to the leadership of the Party and the suggestion that he had the backing of three members of the Cabinet. 
4. At that moment in time the Government had clearly got on top, and the main 
immediate threat to its position and credibility was the possibility of serious trouble during the Apprentice Boys’ day. 
have been hoped: the excellent preparations made by the Security Forces, and their effective deployment, served to prevent any really serious disorder, although there was some deliberate Protestant defiance of the ban on marches, and some Catholic hooliganism in the evening. 
The police have subsequently celebrations in Londonderry on the following As reported elsewhere in this paper, the day passed off as well as could

announced that some of the marchers have been reported for prosecution; and some Catholic rioters involved in actual breaches of public order were arrested and charged. 
5. The satisfactory manner in which potential trouble in Londonderry on 
12th August was dealt with has for the time being strengthened the Government’s hand in its dialogue with its right-wing critics in the Parliamentary Party. At a meeting of this group on 13th August, there was apparently no opposition to Major Chichester-Clark’s leadership, and no serious criticism of his Government’s policies. 
6. 
The Administration is now much more confident than at the beginning of last week, when the Craig challenge was at its peak. 
There remains the 
probability of a meeting of the Unionist Council, a body some 700 strong, at which the Party membership at the grass roots constituency level could, to the Government’s discomfiture, openly express its criticisms. 
the end of August or later. In his present mood 
Major Chichester-Clark bids fair to carry on, whatever criticism might be voiced in such a forum, as long as he can command the support of the Parliamentary Party. 
But in any event it seems unlikely that a meeting will be called until In the meantime Ministers will be looking for ways 
in which to demonstrate to the community and particularly to their supporters their determination to take adequate measures in the law and order field s as to enhance their credibility as a Government. 
Their decision announced on 
14th August to block up certain unapproved roads across the Border in Co Armagh is an example of this. 
7. The rioting in Belfast which egan on 30th July had spent itself by 5th 
August but on that evening Londonderry began to erupt and during the next four nights there were constant attacks by the Bogside youths on the Army accompanied. by the erection of barricades, arson and some petrol bombing. 
Explosions and 
malicious fires were reported from various parts of the Province but mostly in Belfast and the south-east, although the electricity sub-station in Magherafelt, Co Londonderry, was badly damaged by a gelignite explosion on the afternoon of Sunday, 9th August. 
The climax occurred on the night of 11th August at 
Crossmaglen, Co Armagh, within a mile of the Border when two RUC constables died while examining a stolen car which exploded when its door was opened. 
It is 
estimated that there must have been at least 15 lbs of gelignite in the vehicle. Belfast 8.

IRA groups, members of the IRA undoubtedly encouraged and assisted the Republican hooligans who took the major part in it.

15. It would appear therefore that we are faced with a revival of the 
traditional type of attack on members of the Security Forces and prominent Northern Ireland personalities and sabotage of Government buildings and public utilities planned and carried out by groups or individuals acting independently. Trans-border raids and ambushes are likely. 
In fact an eight-man IRA unit 
was in position on the Eire side of the Border near Clady, County Londonderry, hoping to ambush a British Army patrol early on 4th August. A mobile Eire Army patrol surprised them and one man, Thomas Carlin of Londonderry, was captured in possession of a FN rifle, an automatic pistol and plenty of ammunition.

Opportunity was taken to attack the judiciary and the RUC for failing Such resolutions are clearly indicative of the Republican Resolution The political attack on the Government has, for the present, been contained, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are likely to remain under 
pressure from hardline Unionists to enforce "law and order" by which they really mean punitive action against Catholics. 
The fact that these same people 
encourage or acquiesce in illegal Protestant processions is conveniently ignored. 
Further defiance of the ban may lead to Republican counter demon- 
strations, but there are signs that the moderates in the troubled areas are sick and tired of violence and are prepared to try to stop it provided the Security Forces are not obliged to intervene in strength.

on behalf of two youths who had been arrested by the Army on 16th July in the O’Kane’s pub, the Starry Plough, had been damaged 
in a previous riot and his furniture had been stored in a house which was searched by the Army and RUC on 30th July on the strength of information unconnected with O’Kane.

A few rounds of .303 ammunition were discovered The same night his pub was visited by police 
This 
aroused local resentment and about an hour later a bogus 999 call drew an RUC mobile patrol to the same area where it was immediately attacked by a mob armed with stones and bottles. 
The Army was drawn in and a series of scattered Petrol bombs were used against the soldiers and 
two military vehicles set on fire. In one of these local confrontations the 
Army, after several warnings, opened fire and killed one of the petrol bombers, a young Catholic named O’Hagan who had no previous security record. 
10. So much for the events of the Thursday night. As to the causes behind 
this initial outburst of violence there is evidence that early in July the IRA in the North Queen Street/New Lodge Road area discussed ways and means of "demonstrating their offensive position and their control of the area" and an attack on the British Army was considered. militant attitude amongst Republicans in general. 
This may have engendered a The O’Kane affair provided 
the local militant Republicans who were in a mood to take to the streets again with an excuse for an attack on the Security Forces. 
Violence on the first night was organised on what has become the However there is reliable

traditional pattern of stone-throwing, bottle-throwing and petrol bombs, but the shooting of O’Hagan provided a further and far more inflammatory incentive for the violence on the following nights. 
It is obvious that the public in the 
Catholic areas do not regard a petrol bomber in the same light as they regard an armed IRA sniper. 
The deliberate shooting of O’Hagan by a British soldier had 
therefore a great emotional effect and increased the feelings of hatred and animosity against the Army throughout the entire City. 
11. On the Friday night trouble again started in the New Lodge area but spread 
to the Ardoyne soon after where it is reported that IRA men from Ballymurphy and Andersonstown were seen and where it is also known that rumours were deliberately spread of tough military action, shooting and searching in other parts of the City. 
Petrol bombs were again used in the Ardoyne (but not in New Lodge) and the Army opened fire but no casualties can be confirmed.

These incidents may again have been motivated by the news of O’Hagan’s death and it is hoped that they are not the precursor of more serious events in Londonderry where tension is bound to rise in any case before the Apprentice Boys day on 12th August.

Several recent reports have indicated that there have been local There is still no sign of a 
campaign blue-print emerging on the Brady side but at unit level or even individual level there can still be ad hoc independent action which makes it difficult to predict impending trouble.

Mutual Aid by Police 5. 
We now think that to send British police reinforcements for 
specific occasions e.g. 12th August in Londonderry is not appropriate in the immediate future. The Home Secretary might like to float the idea of a (relatively) permanent British police unit. We think it may not appeal to the Northern Ireland Government. "Fence Mending"

action in mind to this end? A note is attached showing the state of the reform programme. 
A review of the Special Powers Acts may be relevant here. The 
Northern Ireland Government have always said that when the time is right they will do away with the Special Powers. The idea that has been in their minds, though it has not been made public, is that the Regulations under the Acts should be put into suspense unless called into operation by an emergency proclamation by the Governor; and that permanent legislation should be enacted creating certain permanent new offences against the State. Mr. Callaghan told the Northern Ireland Government that we would send a note of our views. No note has been sent, but at official level our view is that it would be better to repeal the Acts altogether and start afresh with a new Act enabling Regulations to be made on a proclamation of emergency; that there should be no new permanent offences against the State of the kind the Northern Ireland Government contemplate on the ground that we do not have provisions of that kind here and that they have very little practical utility

to set against the probable criticism that one repressive measure was being substituted for another (criticism which would be unjust, but nonetheless probable). We also think that for the civil authorities the special powers could be limited to fairly mild powers of search and that powers to intern, to proscribe publications and organisations should be done away with altogether. If a need for internment arose it could be the subject of legislation at the time. The Army (including the U.D.R.) would need a range of powers of search and stopping vehicles and so forth all the time and not just during a proclaimed emergency.

PRIME MINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND: SPECIAL COURTS The reason for internment is that while a good deal is 
known about internees, the evidence, such as it is, would not in most cases stand up in court according to normal legal tests; further, even if the evidence were sufficient, there would be obvious objections to disclosing its nature to the defence or allowing a confrontation between the security forces and the accused. It is, therefore, sometimes suggested that special courts should be set up with their own procedure so that in appropriate cases persons at present interned could be brought before them. I have now considered this matter further and consulted the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General to see whether anything can be done to overcome our difficulties by setting up such courts. If the problem were simply that juries perversely 
refused to convict, it would be possible by legislation to dispense with the jury system in such cases and to substitute appointed judges, magistrates or assessors. This is broadly the procedure which has been adopted in the past in the Republic of Ireland. But the special courts there are

required so far as possible to follow normal procedures as regards rules of evidence and standards of proof. This would not do for us. What we need is a procedure to protect witnesses and 
sources of information. The Lord Chancellor tells me that it would be possible to devise a procedure for such circumstances which could nevertheless be regarded as judicial. The procedure would have to be very different from court procedure as known in this country. It would be inquisitorial; the court would be able to ask the accused questions and draw inferences from refusal to answer; material provided on deposition could also be put to the accused. We might also provide that hearsay evidence was to be admissible (and this would undoubtedly increase the number of cases in which we might look for a conviction). The court would need to be given power to impose a sentence instead of an open-ended internment order. It would have to be accepted that such a procedure 
would make fundamental inroads into the protection which we normally give in this country to an accused person. It would deprive him of the right to face his accuser and to contest any evidence before the court which had not been put directly to him in the course of his examination. But

even this draconian procedure would not meet all our difficulties. The identity of witnesses could still become apparent to the accused from the nature of the evidence which was put to him. Further, there would be cases, particularly where the information against the internee came from someone who was himself an internee, where available evidence could not be put before the court at all because none of it could be put to the accused. The question must, therefore, remain how much better off we should be at the end of the day by using this procedure. We must bear in mind that:(a) special courts of this kind could be set up only by legislation which would have to go through our Parliament. It would of its nature be highly controversial and, having faced the criticisms, we might not get as many convictions as we might hope. It might well lead to the release of a number of people whom we would wish to keep in custody. 
(b) we should provide a propaganda advantage to our opponents since many people would rightly criticise what we were doing as denying the accused safeguards which he might reasonably -3-

expect. Our critics could say, with some justice, that a special court operating such procedures is no more than a second "Star Chamber". We have had some experience of mixing inquisitorial and accusatorial systems in the Dutschke tribunal. This proved highly unsatisfactory. 
You referred to the steps taken by Widgery to protect 
witnesses. But he is not conducting a trial. He is operating the inquisitorial procedure provided for in the Tribunals of Inquiry Act (a procedure which has been the subject of bitter criticism in the V and G case). There is no confrontation of witnesses and accused. And Widgery does not have the special problem that, in dealing with the witnesses, some of the evidence comes from fellow-internees, who would not be likely to repeat it before any court, of whatever type. I doubt, therefore, whether special courts provide an 
answer to our problem. At the end of the day, it seems to me, the only solution is for us to decide gradually to let out the internees. They have already been broken down into categories and the least dangerous of them comprise about one-quarter of their number, that is about 150. If we are to get full political advantage from reversing the present

procedures for internment, it is better that these should be let out, possibly in batches. We would use the procedures of the Advisory Body to help us to decide who should be let out and how the present rate of release 
- 44 so far - could 
be speeded up. Judge Brown himself wishes to leave his work at the end of March and I hope we can go some way to giving the body increased status by appointing a more senior judge to preside over it although it may not be easy to persuade a suitable judge to take on this thankless task. It may be necessary to lay down in some detail the criteria on which the committee should work. Such changes in procedure would not require legislation. All this without prejudice to the continued need to put 
internees on trial, wherever possible under the existing law. This is possible only when witnesses and sources of information are not put in peril; and where there is a good prospect of gaining a conviction. We have to face it that there will not be all that many cases which meet these criteria.

There are a number of questions that could arise other than those which were mentioned in GEN 77 yesterday.

As requested in Cairncross’s letter to you yesterday notes With regard to the notes on the supplementary dealing with 
the legal protection of servicemen I should add that this subject has been discussed between the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office, and it has been agreed that: 
a. We should not rule out civil actions against the Crown on account t of deep interrogation (or other matters). Some 
actions are pending, including 3 arising out 
of deep interrogation. We would, however, continue to protect the identities of the individuals concerned and their costs and any damages would be paid by the Crown. 
b. For the time being at least, we should do nothing about the possibility of privately initiated criminal 
proceedings. There have been no such proceedings to date. For deep interrogation the penalties would probably be nominal and the Crown could stand by the personnel as in civil actions. If the possibility of a more serious penalty such as imprisonment was involved we should resort to an Act of Indemnity on an individual basis. 
The additional note added to the Supplementary material sums this up.

CASE OF W J MOORE 1. W J Moore was arrested in the early morning of 9 August 
1971 by Servicemen and removed to the Regional Holding Centre Ballykinler where he was placed in an empty hut with others who had been arrested. He was guarded in the hut by soldiers. He was transferred to the Maidstone early on 11 August and released on 24 August. At some unspecified time thereafter, he disappeared over the Border into the Republic whence he has not officially returned. On 13 September, a writ was issued on his behalf claiming damages for wrongful arrest and imprisonment and assault, trespass to the person and battery. 
2. The preliminary hearing of the case took place on 2 and 17 
November when the question of the discovery of documents was dealt with. Only one Ministry of Defence document, a Brigade Order less some appendices, was withheld on grounds of security, and the Judge accepted the Secretary of State’s certificate without apparent demur on 17 November. The RUC attempted to withhold a number of documents mainly on the grounds of the need to protect the identity of individuals but the Judge refused to accept Mr Faulkner’s certificate and Counsel appealed against this ruling. 
3. On 22 November the main hearing began, and the Plaintiff 
failed to appear. His Counsel argued that the failure was due to fear of further arrest and that this fear was justified by the fact that "military personnel had made a number of visits to his home." Although Moore was wanted by the Police for questioning, this was not revealed to the Judge nor were Moore’s false allegations refuted. In fact military personnel had paid one visit only to Moore’s house in the company of the civil police. An undertaking not to arrest Moore was demanded by Counsel as a precondition of appearance, but the Civil Police naturally refused. The case was adjourned until 22 December when, in the absence of an undertaking to Moore, the Judge ruled that his evidence could be taken in absentia by virtue of a sworn affidavit. The case was reopened on 19 January when Counsel for the Crown gave notice of appeal against both the disclosure of RUC documents and the hearing of the case in the plaintiff’s absence. The plaintiff waived the claim for disclosure and the Judge decided to hear the case. 
4. At the end of the six-day hearing he reserved his judgment 
which was delivered on 18 February. The judgment was that the plaintiff had been wrongfully arrested and detained (due to procedural irregularity) and that he had suffered sufficient in the way of assault, even if many of the allegations of serious ill-treatment had not been proved, to justify the award of the total sum of £300 claimed. This can be construed to mean broadly that the Judge considered the treatment established 
by the Compton Report by itself to constitute assault as justifying the portion of the £300 damages which was not attributable to wrongful arrest and imprisonment.

I then gave oral judgement saying that, on the 3rd January, I had read and furnished to the parties my opinion on the interlocutory matters, that I should hold Orders consequential thereon until the parties or either of them wished to 
address me thereon, that my opinion had been designed to encourage them to agree upon, or ask for, any other form of Order, that 1 had caused the Clerk of the Crown and peace to list the matter on notice for argument and/or Orders on Friday 14th January 1972 at Armagh. in the absence of any application, 1 made the interlocutory Orders now said to be the subject of appeal. 
I added that it was the 
fault of the parties the Orders were in the form finally adopted, that they were bound by any infirmities implicit therein, that the right of appeal in interlocutory matters was itself obscure and the other case a question of fact, and that the present case should proceed if the Plaintiff would forgo the right to Discovery conferred by my earlier Order since that matter involved a serious point of principle. I also took the view that, In the circumstances, and had the case been in the High Court, no Judge of that Court would have taken it out of the list on the very day of trial considering the indulgence given to the parties right up to that day, the second if, indeed, not the third day fixed for trial, and the clear right to move for transfer to the High Court available since November 1971. 
In approaching the evidence, I have applied that principle that, generally 
speaking, if a person has been acquitted of an offence, or has been suspected but not charged or tried, this is irrelevant on the issue of character. There is no evidence before me as to the character of any witness, nor as to what gives rise to any suspicion under which a person has been arrested, detained, or interned, and no presumption against any person arrested, detained or interned, or their evidence, is implied from such matters. This follows from D.P.P. -v- Stirland, 1944 A.C. 315 (1944 to A.E.R.13). I record that Counsel for the parties have never sought to impeach the evidence of any witness other than on the usual basis of conflict of testimony, accuracy of recollection, innocent or deliberate misrepresentation and exaggeration.

Mr McDermott confined the case to whether the arrest by warrant Officer Bullman on the 9th August was lawful under paragraph 10 of the 
Regulations; 
and it is on that basis I trot the matter. It is common case he made the arrest in the terms set forth in the document of authority and aide memoire. The Authorities discussed before me were Christie -v- Leachinky 1947 A.C.573 (1947 1 A.E.R. 567) Gelberg -v- Miller 1961 1 W.L.R . 153 (1951 
1A E.R. 291), 
together with the Judgment of McGonigal, J., in re James McIlduff, unreported, but the type script of which was provided by th parties. 
Following the Christie and McIlduff canes, I hold that the Plaintiff should 
have been at least informed that he was being detained for interrogation for a Period of 48 hours, and, if he was going to be charged with an offence, then he should have been told with what offence he was going to be charged. Thus, he would have known then what situation he had to moot, his family would have known what to tell a Solicitor had he or they sought to employ one, and been properly advised. If nothing else, a question could have arisen as to whether the Plaintiff was entitled to be cautioned before the interrogation took place following a detention under Regulation 10, and even as to what Regulation 10 authorised eg 48 actual hours of interrogation? 
The original arrest was, therefore, wrongful and the Plaintiff is entitled 
to damages upon that score. It is a pure technicality which need never have occurred, but one upon which the Plaintiff can rely. 
Before considering the second question in detail, I should perhaps say that 
a further issue as to the wrongfulness of the arrest and detention could arise by reason of the fact that the Plaintiff was supposed to have been transferred to "a suitable Police Office"; this appears bother from Mr Shillington’s authorisation to the Brigadier (item 1 of Schedule 1) and also in pare. 1 of the authority for arrest set out above. The matter was not fully argued before me

Ballykinler Folding Centre, but it appears to have been between 7 am approx 
departure and around 10 am arrival at Ballykinler in different groups and by diverse transport. Here they were searched, sent to a reception but denuded of all furnishing, racks, press and stools, each alternate arrestee standing and the other sitting. 
Here again the rule was, 
No talking, looking around, smoking and keep eyes fixed on the wall ahead. 
Each half hour or so, th positions wore interchanged. At some stage, and after representations from the RUC they were all made sit down facing the wall so that none of them could see out a window; exercises were then started, hessian sacking placed on certain windows. Medical examinations had started from as early as 7 am according to Dr Plant, and the system was that each arrestee went first to a waiting hut, thence to Reception where he saw police, was stripped, all his property save clothes taken, then was escorted round a "divide" to for a medical, thence to a hut to await interrogation, and, thereafter, to different huts, according to whether he would be subject to further interrogation, or riot, and whether a decision had been made to release him. The huts had identification, and a sketch was handed in of their lay-out, but its lettering is different from that used at the time of interrogation. It is attached hereto, shows a number of huts wired off from the main camp at Ballykinler, how huts were separated from each other by wire, and whore hessian screens were erected at windows and on the roadway on Monday morning at the request of RUC personnel. 
Preparation of the huts was under the charge of who with his troop of 22 had been rushed to Northern Ireland and arrived about mid night on Sunday at Ballykinler to help existing forces. 
He said he had orders to clear 16 huts starting from 4 30 am and to finish 
in 90 mins. There are not 16 huts on the sketch, and some of the buildings were in fact being prepared for Reception (ie Police and Doctor) and interrogation;

Only some of th buildings, therefore, were left denuded of all furnishings, so that a bare floor, roof and walls, together with lighting, was provided for the arrestees. The floors wore dirty, and nails and screws had been loft on the floor at points where they had fallen, if indeed any were removed. Probably the balance of the 16 huts cleared wore in the main camp. 
Guards were provided outside the main camp, also inside the main camp but 
outside the wired off compound, all armed; unarmed guards wore on duty inside the compound and there was a contingent of RUC personnel, uniformed and plain clothes inside. 
Custody of the 89 arrestees was entrusted to 
of the Royal Military Police with the assistance of and their separate platoons each of about 15 men. They guarded the 
huts and provided escorts to reception, toilet facilities and interrogation and for necessary movement. They were all members of the Royal Military Police, aided from time to time by RUC. 
The duty started on Monday morning with though platoon, gave some help (but whether inside the waiting hut or 
outside is not clear) up until mid day when he was stood down with all his men, went to rest until duty again at midnight. 
says he was briefed that, 
"in the interest of security, warders should ensure that detained persons hands were visible and that a degree of discipline be maintained". 
He agreed that this was not a normal duty for Military Police, nor was it the task for which they had been trained; their function and training was to enquire into crime, apprehend criminals, bring arrested personnel back to Barracks, and that guard duty was something with which they were quite unfamiliar.

Intelligence normally questioned suspects, It was not ascertained who gave 
his briefing, though he 
was under the command of the Battery Commander; but he says that, after receiving his briefing from his Superior Officers, he was carrying out their Orders. 
In turn spoke certainly to perhaps also 
to Staff Sergeant Love and passed on the briefing in terms;"because the men were carrying out the task unarmed, and were so few in any one hut, that they should have firm but fair discipline in all huts and ensure hands were visible". 
The military Police admit that exercises, or as they preferred to call them, changes of position, went on in the huts yet 
of the RUC 
says that he saw none and heard no commands being given; he does not appear to have had much contact with the actual huts, he being behind the hessian on the interrogation and reception side of the compound, and was only "topside of the road" (ie hut side) on a few occasions if he did not know it means that he had just kept out of the way. He had been in the huts about hessian on the windows, but that seems to have been early on Monday morning, and had been at the door of huts on other occasions. He is important, for he did accept that if exercises or changes of position did go on to the extent alleged, and later admitted by the two staff Sergeants and 
that it was 
wrong to ask men to do that. They went on until midnight on Monday 9th August, in at least one hut were resumed in some fashion about 3 am and, in all huts, continued on Tuesday, save for people in the hut reserved for those in respect of whom a decision to release had been made. They really continued on Tuesday until interrogation stopped and preparations for removal of prisoners to other places were put in hand. Every Prisoner had to do these exercises. The only real dispute was a denial by military witnesses that exercises were enforced

STATEMENT ON PARKER REPORT The majority report that the methods in question which 
had been applied on a number of occasions in the past under successive Governments in various parts of the world were applied in Northern Ireland to 12 detainees, and in October to two more. 
They considered that "there is no doubt that 
the information obtained by these two operations directly and indirectly was reponsible for the saving of lives of innocent citizens." 
They concluded that the use of the methods 
involved could indeed be justified in exceptional circumstances subject to further safeguards which they recommended. 
The 
Government consider that while there is much to be said theoretically and practically in favour of these arguments, in present circumstances the methods in question are not necessary or desirable in the public interest, and that the practical and legal difficulties of their continued use outweigh any advantages that they might possess. 
The Government have therefore directed that they should no longer be used. 28th February, 1972

AD HOC CONFERENCE TO BRING ABOUT AN END TO IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT TRIAL 
Seventy persons acting as Representatives or Observers for thirty-five Organisations responded to an invitation to an Ad Hoc Conference held on Sunday at the Student’s Union in Queens University. 
The Organisations bridged the Social, Political and Religious divide. They were as follows:- 
Gaelic League University ad Training College Chaplains Forresters Humanists Hibernians Womens’ Action Committees Representatives of Medical Profession Minority Rights Association Catholic Ex-Servicemens Association Representatives of Legal Profession New Ulster Movement Central Citizens’ Defence Committee N.I.Civil Rights Association Andersonstown Civil Rights Committee Irish Congress of Trade Unions Association of Legal Justice Alliance Party 
People’s Democracy Communist Party Nationalist Party Republican Labour Party United Nations Organisation (Belfast) Alternative Assembly Dail Uladh Derry Central Citizens Committee Irish National Teachers Organisation Northern Ireland Liberal Party Religious Society of Friends Irish Transport & General Workers Union Armagh Resistance Council Voluntary Community Service Group Peoples Assembly of Ardoyne Northern Resistance Movement University Lecturers Clergy from four rain Churches 
The following resolutions were passed unanimously:1. This Conference cas for the immediate ending of Imprisonment without trial. 2. This Conference be constituted as a Standing Conference for the purpose of 
achieving liaison with all groups and individuals who are committed to help end imprisonment without trial and to stimulate ideas helpful towards this end. 
3. The Convenors were instructed to form a Committee representative of those attending to implement Conference decisions. 
4. The Conference decided that if imprisonment without trial is still operative on February 9th (the sixth month anniversary of its introduction) that their campaign and activities should commence on that date. 
The Conference recommended to the Committee that a massive public relations campaign should be undertaken to achieve its aim and that this should be directed in the first instance at home to people of all denominations, the feeling being that if the real meaning of this arbitrary imprisonment with its human tragedies were known and understood, then the whole community would unite in rejecting it. It was also recommended that the Committee should concern itself with a circulation of publications and information directed at public opinion in the U.K., Europe and throughout the world. 
It was suggested that it should be emphasised 
that imprisonment without trial has not worked in Northern Ireland and has largely contributed towards making Northern Ireland ungovernable. It was recommended that a Legal Advice Service for internees and their families be established. 
It was also recommended that the Conference contact the Trade Unions and the

21st February, 1972. Sir, I am directed by the Governor of Northern Ireland to refer to my 
letter of February 10, in which I acknowledged your telex message of February 9, and said that His Ecellency had caused it to be referred to his advisers, in accordance with the Constitution. Lord Grey has since received an undated document, headed "Ad Hoc Conference to bring about an end to Imprisonment without Trial", which shows that copies of the telex message were sent to a number of persons, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, but not to Ministers here. 
Your telegram urged the ending of internment upon the sole ground 
that it had not worked, but the message made a number of other very serious criticisms of the principle and practice of internment and these merit a reasoned reply. 
Imprisonment without trial was described as being "unjust" and 
"immoral". I am to observe that although article 5 of the Convention for the protection of Human Right and Fundamental Freedoms declares the principle that no one shall be deprived of his liberty unless convicted by a court of law, or for certain other limited reasons, article 15 recognises that this principle may have to be abrogated "in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation". The Ad hoo Conference presumably questions the moral right, or indeed the duty, of the Government of Northern Ireland to protect the community against armed terrorists by this means. 
The Government of Northern Ireland has, with regret, deemed it 
necessary to intern people as a measure directed against organisations whose declared aim it is to overthrow the institutions of the state by violence, including indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population. Such organisations have been denounced by the Churches in Northern Ireland, including the Roman Catholic Church. The Government regrets, therefore, that internment here should be described in your message as "sectarian". 
His Excellency’s advisers strenuously contest the claim in your 
message that internment has caused death and destruction. So far from its being a cause of death and destruction, it was introduced only because other measures had proved inadequate to counter the campaign of death and destruction previously launched by the organisations seeking to overthrow the institutions of the state. It is regrettably

true that that campaign was intensified in the months following the introduction of interment. Regrettably also, some of the active opposition to internment and much of the misrepresentation about its use have encouraged terrorism. 
The alienation of many elements in the Roman Catholic community 
and the polarisation of Catholics and non-Catholics to which your message refers are sad indeed and much against the general public interest. Security policies will inevitably be resented in those sections of the community in which are found those deemed to be working against the security of the whole community. There may well result a real belief on the part of some that the working of such policies is an attack on the rights of a minority. It is sadly true, however, that this belief, although mistaken, is actively fostered by others. 
The call of your Conference for the ending of internment is 
based on the claim that it has not worked. His Excellency is advised that it has been increasingly effective in its original purpose of removing subversive organisations from areas in which they previously held sway, so that there now are areas in Belfast and elsewhere in which it is more tolerable to live because there are no longer organisations there to terrorise the people of those areas. Those who are freed from intimidation, however, do not in general articulately proclaim the fact. The point must also be made that there are some who do not wish internment to work but who wish to see subversive organisations succeed in their aim of procuring constitutional changes that are contrary to the wishes of a majority in the community. 
His Excellency’s Ministers strongly contest the suggestion in 
your message that there are now "in Stormont’s terms an additional 5,000 members of the minority qualified for interment". This is perhaps a suggestion that people are interned because of their political views. The Prime Minister has publicly stated and repeated that persons are interned solely because they are deemed to be members of, or actively associated with, subversive organisations. 
Where 
the Advisory Committee have been satisfied that an internee does not fall into this category they have so recommended and that man has been released. If, on the other hand, the statement is intended to mean that internment has brought 5,000 recruits into the ranks of subversive organisations, this also must be contested. Recent arrests have shown clearly that most of those now active in such organisations were recruited before August 1971, when internment was introduced.

Your telegram stated that "torture (has) now reached 
unprecedented level" and seemingly asserts that this is after the interrogation in depth of fourteen persons by the methods described in the Compton Report and considered by Lord Parker’s Committee, the report of which is awaited. There have been complaints of illtreatment in other oases, all of which are investigated, although investigation is frequently difficult when complaints are made through newspapers rather than directly to the authorities concerned. Action is taken on well-founded complaints but there has been nothing to substantiate the statement in your telegram. Arrangements for medical examinations of internees have been further improved, not only to safeguard the interests of persons arrested but also to prevent baseless allegations. 
I am to say that it is the wish of the Government of Northern 
Ireland to end internment as soon as possible. Merely to advise the immediate ending of internment is to misunderstand the realities of the present situation and the need to protect the community generally; but any serious proposals for the ending of internment consonant with the general public interest will be most carefully considered by the Government. 
As directed, I am sending a copy of this letter to the Prime 
Minister of the United Kingdom and to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. 
I have the honour to be, Sir, 
Your obedient Servant, 
(Major R. Stephens) (Private 
Secretary) 
Thomas E. Conaty, Esq., Chairman, Minority Rights Association.

PRIME MINISTER At your suggestion, I telephoned Lord Parker this 
Lord Parker said that he still believed 
afternoon and asked him whether he had had any further thoughts about the feasibility of special courts to replace the present internment procedures. 
that the nub 
of the problem was the safeguarding of the identity of key witnesses, not only from the press and the public, but also from the accused and his legal representative. 
He

1. The Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, in conjunction with 
HQ Northern Ireland and the UK Representative in Belfast, have reviewed the administrative arrangements for internment. One of the main objects was to see what dispositions could be made now against a possible decision to begin running down internment. 
2. All internees have now been divided on paper into three categories, the 
highly dangerous, the dangerous and the less dangerous. 25% fall into the first category, 50 into the second and 25% into the third. 
3. At the end of February, another compound at Long Kesh will be ready and it 
is proposed to transfer to it most of those in the less dangerous category. There are great difficulties in preventing control of internment camps from passing to the IRA leadership, but the opening of a new compound for the less intransigent provides an opportunity for establishing proper control. 
4. An experienced governor of this new compound could also help to decide 
whether the paper sift of the less dangerous was reasonably accurate and devise a regime to prepare the men for release. 
5. It is unlikely, however, that the Northern Ireland Prison Service will be 
able to provide a Governor with the necessary qualities. It is, therefore, proposed to look for a suitable man from the Prison Service here. (The Governor from the English service seconded to take charge of Magilligan Camp is reported to be doing well.) 
6. The opening of another compound also means that a more senior man is 
needed to take charge of and manage the camp as a whole. It looks as though this too will have to be done by a governor from the Prison Service here.

Ref. A01198 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland: Report of Lord Parker’s Committee on Interrogation Procedures 
The essence of the difference of opinion between the majority and the 
minority reports is that Lord Parker and Mr. Boyd-Carpenter think that, except in so far as their use is required for purposes of security and safety, the techniques in question should be used only where it is considered vitally necessary to obtain information, and then subject to the safeguards which they outline in paragraphs 36-42 of their report; while Lord Gardiner does not believe that there are any circumstances in which it would be right to employ them, even, apparently, for the security of detainees themselves. 2. 
The principal questions for consideration by Ministers would seem 
to be:(a) Issues of Principle An endorsement of the majority recommendations would include 
acceptance of the proposition that, in any case in which it was proposed to apply the techniques, the Minister concerned should take advice about the legal position and should, if necessary, take steps to ensure protection for those taking part in the operation. 
This presents a dilemma. If the 
recommendation is not accepted, those taking part in the operation would be legally at risk. Lord Gardiner considers that the techniques are illegal anywhere; and Lord Parker and Mr. Boyd-Carpenter, while not expressing a view upon questions which may be tested in the courts of Northern Ireland, consider that some, if not all, of the techniques would constitute criminal assaults under English law and might also give rise to civil proceedings. On the other hand, if the recommendation is accepted, a Minister who sought to ensure legal protection would have to overcome the objections which Lord Gardiner summarises in sub-paragraph (4) on pages 27 and 28 of his minority report. The implication of this dilemma is that Ministers might well feel that they could not for some time (and until some opportunity presented itself for the very difficult legislation involved in reversing legal cover) authorise the use of techniques of this kind in support of interrogation. This does not mean that there would be no more interrogation; the absence of these techniques would, however, underline the importance of the recommendation in paragraph 40 of the majority report, i. e. that a panel of highly skilled interrogators should be kept in being.

that there might well be situations when, in an emergency, the Government had to take action which was against the law and then pass an Act of Indemnity subsequently, but such occasions would necessarily be rare. 
This was the line which the Northern 
Ireland Government were proposing to take about what had happened. They were thinking of having an Act of Indemnity for criminal assaults. They were allowing civil suits to be brought but if such suits were successful We Government would pay the damages which were not thought likely to be large. Lord Parker said that he thought this was the right course to follow. 
The Prime Minister asked Lord Parker about the 
suggestion that was often made that special courts should be set up to try internees. Lord Parker said that he found it difficult to conceive of a criminal court in which the identity of a prosecution witness was kept secret from the accused and his legal representatives. There had been nothing like this in English legal history since we Seventeenth Century.

I THE MAJORITY REPORT 
OUR APPROACH 1 
"Terrorism" no doubt connotes violence, and violence for political ends. 
This could arise under normal conditions, in which case those suspected of such conduct would be dealt with in the same way as any other persons suspected of crime. 
our inquiry ordinary police interrogation. 
We do not, however, construe our terms of reference as including in We have accordingly confined our 
inquiry to interrogation in circumstances where some public emergency has arisen as a result of which suspects can legally be detained without trial. 
2 We also read our terms of reference as calling upon us to inquire quite 
generally into the interrogation and custody of persons suspected of terrorism in such circumstances in the future, and not specifically in connection with Northern Ireland. 
In particular, we are not called upon to consider afresh matters already dealt with in the Compton Report (Cmnd Paper 4823). Further, 
while in our view the use of some if not all the techniques in question would constitute criminal assaults and might also give rise to civil proceedings under English law, we refrain from expressing any view in respect of the position in Northern Ireland in deference to the courts there, before whom we understand proceedings which raise this issue are pending. 
3 As our inquiry progressed it became clear that the only "procedures 
currently authorised", in the sense of authorised by the civil power, were such as could be said to comply with the Joint Directive on Military Interrogation of 17 February 1965 (JIC(65)15), as amended in 1967 as a result of the Report of Mr Roderic Bowen QC (Cmnd Paper 3165). 
A note summarising the rules of this 
Directive was published in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report but for the sake of accuracy we set out in the Appendix such extracts from this Directive as are immediately relevant to our inquiry. 
4 It will be seen that this Directive, though dealing with Internal Security 
operations, refers to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949) and then sets out the principles contained in that Article. 
However, that Convention, Convention No III, deals with international 
warfare and the more apt Convention is Convention No IV, dealing with internal civilian disturbances in which Article 3 is in the same terms. 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 1035\\IMG_4997_PREM_15_475 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

5 Even so, it is arguable that Convention No IV itself does not apply in the 
emergencies which we are considering and the same can be argued in respect of our other international obligations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Article 3) and under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 5). 
6 Whether any of these international obligations are applicable in circum- 
stances such as have occurred in Northern Ireland and, if so, whether and to what extent the interrogations conducted there conflicted with those obligations is the subject of an application to the European Commission and accordingly we refrain from expressing a view thereon. 
for us to express a view as to the applicability of any of these obligations. The principles in paragraph 5 (a) and (b) of the Directive fairly set out the obligations under the Geneva Convention and those to whom it is addressed are enjoined to comply with them. 
It is, however, in any event unnecessary In other words, if that Convention is applicable, 
operations that are within the Directive will be in conformity with our obligations under that Convention. 
Moreover, since the obligations in Article 3 of that 
Convention embrace in all material respects our other international obligations, operations which are in conformity with the former will also be in conformity with the latter obligations. 
7 The first question therefore is whether the techniques in current use in 
fact comply with the Directive. 8 
The Directive moreover merely sets out the limits beyond which action may 
not go, and does not attempt to define the limits to which it is morally permissible to go. 
Accordingly a second and more difficult question arises as to whether, 
even if the use of these techniques complies with the Directive, their application by a civilised and humane society can be morally justified. 
who appeared before us urged that this Country should set an example to the World by improving on the standards in the Geneva Convention and applying what were described as the basic principles of ’humanitarian law’. 
Some of the witnesses They took the line that, 
even though innocent lives could be and had been saved by the use of the techniques described in the Compton Report, a civilised society should never use them. They argued that, once methods of this character were employed on people in detention in order to obtain information from them, the society which employed them was morally on a slippery slope leading to the deliberate infliction of torture. 
It

was better that servants of the State and innocent civilians should die than that the information which could save them should ever be obtained by such methods. This approach has the attraction of relieving one of the difficult exercise of judgment involved in deciding exactly how far it is permissible to go in particular circumstances. 
9 is not of great assistance. 
Further, in considering the limits to which action may go, terminology There is a wide spectrum between discomfort and 
hardship at the one end and physical or mental torture at the other end. Discomfort and hardship are clearly matters which any persons suspected of crime, under ordinary conditions, will suffer and that is accepted as not only inevitable but permissible. 
or mental, is not justified under any conditions. 
Equally, everyone would agree that torture, whether physical Where, however, does hardship 
and discomfort end and for instance humiliating treatment begin, and where does the latter end and torture begin? 
Whatever words of definition are used, 
opinions will inevitably differ as to whether the action under consideration falls within one or the other definition. 
THE TECHNIQUES AND THEIR HISTORY 10 
answers across a table. sense ancillary activities. 
Essentially interrogation in depth consists in the main of questions and The techniques which have been criticised are in a While other techniques may be devised in the future, 
the only techniques in current use are those referred to in the Compton Report, that is, wall-standing, hooding, noise, bread and water diet and deprivation of sleep. 
A demonstration of these techniques was given to your Committee. They 
have been developed since the War to deal with a number of situations involving internal security. 
Some or all have played an important part in counter insurgency 
operations in Palestine, Malaya, Kenya and Cyprus and more recently in the British Cameroons (1960-61), Brunei (1963), British Guiana (1964), Aden (1964-67), Borneo/Malaysia (1965-66), the Persian Gulf (1970-71) and in Northern Ireland (1971). 
11 The object of all the techniques undoubtedly is to make the detainee, from 
whom information is required, feel that he is in a hostile atmosphere, subject to strict discipline, and that he is completely isolated so that he fears what may happen next. 
A further object of some of the techniques, varying according to 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 1035\\IMG_4999_PREM_15_475 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

local conditions, is one of security and safety. Thus it may be vital in the 
detainee’s own interest that he is not recognised by his fellow detainees. It is also necessary that the detainees should not communicate with each other, or with the outside world, or get to know where they are being held or the identity of their guards. 
the guards and prevent the escape of the detainees. 
Finally, it is necessary to ensure the safety of In fact, some of these 
techniques when applied fulfil both aims: thus the wall posture not only ensures the safety of the guards, but also induces stricter discipline. 
Hooding and 
noise likewise have dual aims, that of security and that of producing a sense of complete isolation. 
12 One of the unsatisfactory features of the past has been the fact that no 
rules or guidelines have been laid down to restrict the degree to which these techniques can properly be applied. 
Indeed, it cannot be assumed that any UK 
Minister has ever had the full nature of these particular techniques brought to his attention, and, consequently, that he has ever specifically authorised their use. 
13 These techniques are taught at purpose-built intelligence centres where 
Service personnel are instructed in the art of interrogation in depth, and where members of our Services are also taught to be resistant to such interrogation. Even at such a centre there are no standing orders or manuals dealing in detail with the use of such techniques, and accordingly their exact application in real life situations depends upon the training already received by those who employ them. 
and specially so when their use is entrusted to personnel not completely trained in their use. 
envisages a comparatively short period at the wall and subjection to hooding and noise there, while the detainees are taken one by one to be medically examined and the method of interrogation is assessed. 
Once that interrogation has taken 
place, it is envisaged that normally the detainee will be taken to a cell and not returned to the wall, or be hooded or subjected to noise. 
In practice, it may 
turn out that, through lack of proper accommodation, through lack of guards, through lack of interrogators, through the need to obtain personal and medical files and such matters, the degree of use envisaged is exceeded. 
In those 
circumstances, and in the absence of definite guidelines, there is a risk that the techniques will be applied to a greater degree than is justified either morally or under the Directive. 
It will be seen at once that such techniques can easily be used to excess, To illustrate the matter, we understand that the Service training

15 on mental health. 
We received a good deal of evidence on the effect of these techniques One of the difficulties is that there is no reliable informa- 
tion in regard to mental effects, particularly long-term mental effects, and, as one would expect, the medical evidence varied somewhat in emphasis. 
Evidence 
we have received is to the effect that, while the techniques may produce some mental disorientation, this is expected to disappear within a matter of hours at the end of the interrogation. 
some mental effects may persist for up to two months. That was the 
It is true that in a small minority of cases There is no evidence 
of a mental effect lasting longer, though very fairly all the medical witnesses were unable to rule out that possibility, certainly in the case of a constitutionally vulnerable detainee. 
Moreover, even if the mental effect did not disappear at 
once, it was impossible to say how far that was due to the techniques employed as opposed to the anxiety state which would be induced by reason of the detainee’s continued detention, and, if he gave information, the guilty knowledge which he had of letting down his fellows coupled with the fear of reprisals. 
16 We considered the results of such experiments as have been made in connection with sensory deprivation. We heard evidence concerning army personnel 
who had been subjected to these techniques in order to train them in resistance. In such cases no lasting mental effect whatever has been observed, but in our opinion this is by no means conclusive. different from the experiment. 
The real thing is obviously quite We also heard evidence of experiments conducted 
on student volunteers, usually involving a more extreme form of sensory deprivation. 
such sensory deprivation for more than a comparatively short period. 
In these cases many of the volunteers were found unable to withstand However, 
not only were the experiments again of necessity different from the real thing, but in these cases the volunteers neither enjoyed a break during which medical examination and later interrogation took place, nor were they members of an organisation bound together by bonds of loyalty which would help them to hold out.

17 In the result, we have come to the conclusion that, while long-term 
mental injury cannot scientifically be ruled out, particularly in the case of a constitutionally vulnerable individual, there is no real risk of such injury if proper safeguards are applied in the operation of these techniques. We deal with suggested safeguards in paragraphs 35 to 42 below. 
THE VALUE OF THE TECHNIQUES AND THE ALTERNATIVES 18 
There is no doubt that when used in the past these techniques have 
produced very valuable results in revealing rebel organisation, training and ’Battle Orders’. 
the innocence both of other wanted people and of the detainee himself. 19 
Interrogation also sometimes had the effect of establishing Coming to recent times, the position in Northern Ireland prior to 
August 1971 was that the Security Forces were in need of hard intelligence. Information obtained by the RUC by ordinary police interrogation had failed to provide anything but a general picture of the IRA organisation. 
As a result 
the Security Forces were hampered in their search for arms and explosives and in addition were liable to harass and antagonise innocent citizens. 
On the 
introduction of internment two operations of interrogation in depth took place involving the use of these techniques. 
In August 1971 12 detainees and in 
October 1971 two detainees were interrogated in depth. 20

22 There is of course a danger that, if the techniques are applied to an 
undue degree, the detainee will, either consciously or unconsciously, give false information. 
So far as the operations in Northern Ireland are concerned, 
however, the information given was quickly proved to be correct except in a few cases in which incorrect descriptions were given of persons who could not be identified by name. 23 
the information thus obtained. 
A further advantage was the ’snowball’ effect generated by following up Moreover, the indirect effect of these two 
operations of interrogation was that further information could be, and was, more readily obtained by ordinary police interrogation. 24 
There is no doubt that the information obtained by these two operations directly and indirectly was responsible for the saving of lives of innocent citizens.

29 the techniques are applied. 
The true view, it seems to us, must depend upon the degree to which It is one thing, for instance, to keep a detainee 
at the wall, hooded and subjected to noise, for x hours before oral interrogation, and thereafter to return him to a cell unhooded and not subjected to noise. It is another to keep him under these conditions at the wall for 2x hours and to return him to the wall after interrogation again hooded and subjected to noise. It must also depend on the length of time during which he is deprived of sleep or given a restricted diet. condition of the detainee. 
And all these matters depend upon the medical What would be intolerable for a man in poor health 
might amount to no more than inconvenience for a fit man. 30 
Whether or not what is done is in conformity with the Directive falls 
in our view to be judged by how a dispassionate observer would view the operation if he saw the techniques being applied. 
Further, we think that such 
expressions as "humane", "inhuman", "humiliating" and "degrading" fall to be judged by such an observer in the light of the circumstances in which the techniques are applied, for example, that the operation is taking place in the course of urban guerilla warfare in which completely innocent lives are at risk; that there is a degree of urgency; and that the security and safety of the interrogation centre, of its staff and of the detainees are important considerations. 31 
Viewed in this way we think that the application of these techniques, 
subject to proper safeguards limiting the occasion on which and the degree to which they can be applied, would be in conformity with the Directive. 32 
So far as the moral issue is concerned, we feel that in a limited number 
of situations, in particular those in which urban guerillas are concerned, the attitude taken up by the witnesses as set out in paragraph 8 is unrealistic and one which is unfair both to the State and to law abiding citizens. 
Moreover, 
circumstances can be envisaged in which ’humanitarian’ law as well as domestic law will allow a measure of self-defence. 
we are concerned, though short of war in its ordinary sense, are in many ways worse than war. 
Guerilla warfare will be taking place within the country; 
friend and foe will not be identifiable; the rebels may be ruthless men determined to achieve their ends by indiscriminate attacks on innocent persons. If information is to be obtained, time must be of the essence of the operation. 
The public emergencies in which alone

33 We have also considered the argument that, however careful the selection 
of detainees for interrogation in depth, it may on occasion involve the interrogation of a man wrongly suspected. 
It can accordingly be argued that 
to subject such a man to these techniques is something which should not be tolerated. 
There is some force in this argument, but it must be remembered 
that even under normal conditions it is accepted that a person suspected of ordinary crime, who may thereafter be found not guilty, can be subjected to some measure of discomfort, hardship and mental anxiety. 
Moreover, interrogation 
in depth may itself reveal the innocence of the detainee and allow of his release from detention. 
34 We have come to the conclusion that the answer to the moral question is 
dependent on the intensity with which these techniques are applied and on the provision of effective safeguards against excessive use. dealt with in the following paragraphs. 
Subject to these safeguards we have 
come to the conclusion that there is no reason to rule out these techniques on moral grounds and that it is possible to operate them in a manner consistent with the highest standards of our society. 
These safeguards are 
RECOMMENDED SAFEGUARDS 35 
It is, however, we think of importance that, except in so far as their 
use is required for purposes of security and safety, these techniques should only be used in cases where it is considered vitally necessary to obtain information. 36 
Whether the techniques are used only for the purposes of security and 
safety or also for the purpose of obtaining information, care should be taken that they are only applied in conformity with the Directive. 
We Accordingly, we 
think that there should be guidelines to assist Service personnel as to the degree to which in any particular circumstances the techniques can be applied. 
suggest guidelines as opposed to rules because we recognise that it may sometimes be impracticable to comply fully with them. 
Some discretion must be left to the 
man in charge of the operation, but any departure from them should be the subject of a special report to his superior officer.

41 We think that a doctor with some psychiatric training should be present 
at all times at the interrogation centre, and should be in a position to observe the course of oral interrogation. 
It is not suggested that he should be himself responsible for stopping the interrogation - rather that he should warn 
the controller if he felt that the interrogation was being pressed too far having regard to the demeanour of the detainee, leaving the decision to the controller. This should be some safeguard both for the constitutionally vulnerable detainee and at the same time for the interrogator. 
42 We think that, when these techniques are employed, machinery should be set 
up to ensure that complaints are passed on to the Ministry concerned and that a person or body should be appointed to investigate any such complaints. 
The existence of such machinery for the In this connection we In this

II THE MINORITY REPORT 1 I very much regret that I am unable to agree with my distinguished colleagues 
in their report. 2 
It seems to me clear that the ’procedures’ which our terms of reference require 
us to consider are the procedures of ’interrogation in depth’ so described in the report of the Compton Committee of 3 November 1971 (’the first Compton report’) and in the further report of Sir Edmund Compton of 14 November (’the second Compton report’). 
If there were any doubt, it is clear from the statements in the House 
of Commons made by the Home Secretary on 16, 17 and 29 November and by the Minister of State for Defence on 9 December that those are the ’procedures’ intended to be referred to. 
3 
The questions which arise therefore appear to me to be: (a) 
(b) (c) (d) 
Of what did those ’procedures’ consist? Were they ’authorised’? What were their effects? 
Do they, in the light of their effects, require amendment and, if so, in what respects? 
OF WHAT DID THOSE PROCEDURES CONSIST? 4 
The first Compton report considered the cases of 11 out of 12 men who had been 
submitted to ’interrogation in depth’ at an interrogation centre in Northern Ireland from 11 to 17 August 1971 and the second Compton report considered the case of one of two men who had been so interrogated from 11 to 18 October. 
5 
Their conclusions were that the procedures consisted of: (a) Keeping the detainees’ heads covered by a black hood except when being interrogated or in a room by themselves and that this constituted physical ill-treatment. 
(b) Submitting the detainees to continuous and monotonous noise of a volume calculated to isolate them from communication and that this was a form of physical ill-treatment.

(c) Depriving the detainees of sleep during the early days of the operation and that this constituted physical ill-treatment. 
(d) Depriving the detainees of food and water other than one round of bread and one pint of water at sixhourly intervals and that this constituted physical ill-treatment for men who were being exhausted by other means at the same time. 
(e) Making the detainees stand against a wall in a required posture (facing wall, legs apart, with hands raised up against wall)except for periodical lowering of the arms to restore circulation, and that detainees attempting to rest or sleep by propping their heads against the wall were prevented from doing so and that, if a detainee collapsed on the floor, he was picked up by the armpits and placed against the wall to resume the required posture and that the action taken to enforce this posture constituted physical ill-treatment. 
They found that the 11 men were at the wall for periods totalling 9, 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 23, 29, 30, 40 and 431/2 hours. 
The second 
Compton report shows that the man the subject of that report was at the wall for periods totalling 35 hours. 
6 I have thought it essential to state what the procedures referred to in the 
Compton reports were because they were never published or even written down anywhere. We have been told that these procedures of interrogation in depth, namely hooding, a noise machine, wall-standing and deprivation of diet and sleep, were never committed to writing in any directive, order, syllabus or training manual. 
They 
had been for some time orally taught for use in emergency conditions, in Colonialtype situations, at an army intelligence centre in England. 
They had been used 
in Aden, although, surprisingly, it does not appear from the report of Mr Roderic Bowen QC on Interrogation in Aden (Cmnd 3165 of 1966) that he ever discovered that these interrogation procedures were used there. 
Officers and men of the English 
Intelligence Centre held a seminar on the procedures in Northern Ireland in April 1971 to teach orally the procedures to members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary; officers from the English Intelligence Centre were present in the control room of

the interrogation centre in Northern Ireland throughout the periods covered by the Compton reports. 
7 We are not a court of appeal from the Compton Committee and I accept their 
conclusions subject to the following points: (a) While records were kept of the movements of the detainees for 11, 12 and 13 August, the records for most of them were discontinued some time on 14 or 15 and for four on 16 August, so that the figures of wall-standing in the first Compton report only relate to the dates for which there were records, wall-standing being discontinued thereafter. 
(b) The report does not indicate for how long any detainee was standing continuously at the wall. the partial records. 
We have seen copies of They show that, subject to breaks for 
bread and water and for toilet visits, some detainees were standing continuously at the wall for periods of 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 hours. 
(c) The first Compton report states in paragraph 68 ’Weight. The records kept by the doctor for each detainee on entering and leaving the centre all show loss of weight during the time spent there.’ We have ascertained that, as there was no weighing machine when the 11 men arrived, the recorded entry weights were mere estimates made by the doctor looking at the man. 
On the assumed weights there were losses up to 1 stone 2 lbs in six days. 
(d) In paragraph 105 of the first Compton report the Committee say ’We consider that brutality is an inhuman or savage form of cruelty, and that cruelty implies a disposition to inflict suffering, coupled with indifference to, or pleasure in, the victim’s pain.’ 
Under this definition, which some Lest by silence I should be thought 
to have accepted this remarkable definition, I must say that I cannot agree with it.

prison rules. So is enforced deprivation of sleep. 
(b) In Northern Ireland in normal times the powers of the police and prison officers in relation to those in custody are substantially the same except for an immaterial difference in their Judges’ Rules. 
Of 
the Regulations scheduled to the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922, Regulation 10 provides that ’Any officer of The Royal Ulster Constabulary, for the preservation of the peace and maintenance of order, may authorise the arrest without warrant and detention for a period of not more then 48 hours of any person for the purpose of interrogation’. 
This Regulation does not in any way 
extend the ordinary police powers as to the permissible methods or limits of interrogation. 
Regulation 11 
provides a limited power of detention and a limited right to photograph and finger-print and Regulation 12 a limited right of internment. 
Regulation 13(5) provides 
that ’Persons detained or interned in any of Her Majesty’s prisons shall be subject to any rules for the government of prisoners awaiting trial including such general rules as are applicable to such prisoners, for the time being in force, except in so far as the said rules are inconsistent with this regulations. 
certain Directions made by the Minister for Home Affairs, Northern Ireland, with regard thereto. 
There is nothing 
in them to extend the ordinary police powers of interrogation or to validate the procedures. 
(c) We have received both written and oral representations from many legal bodies and individual lawyers from both England and Northern Ireland. 
There has been no dissent from the 
view that the procedures are illegal alike by the law of England and the law of Northern Ireland. We have seen the Constitution of Aden and the relevant Statutory Instruments and Regulations relating to Aden and the same applies to Aden law, 
We have seen the Prison Rules and

The procedures were and are illegal. 11 International law

Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides that ’No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. 
(ii) 
Articles 7 and 10 of The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which the United Kingdom has signed but not yet ratified) which provides that ’7. No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
In

WHAT WERE THEIR EFFECTS? 12 
It is necessary to consider this in some detail. The situation in Northern 
Ireland is one in which members of the Irish Republican Army are conducting a campaign of terror which includes brutal murders, arson, the use of explosives against innocent men, women and children and outrages of all kinds. 
There is 
virtually a war going on between the Government of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republican Army and in this conflict the lives, not only of innocent civilians but of the police and army, are at stake in circumstances of appalling difficulty for the members of those forces whose courage, resolution and behaviour are all so well known. 
It has been submitted to us that because these things are so - and in my opinion 
they are so - the procedures were necessary to obtain, for the purpose of saving lives, information which could not otherwise have been obtained or alternatively not obtained so quickly, that they are therefore morally justifiable, that the same may well be so in future conditions of emergency elsewhere and that the procedures with such amendments as may be thought desirable, should remain available. 
This raises questions, including moral questions,which cannot be determined without considering the effects of the procedures on the obtaining of intelligence information, on the detainees, on the relations between the forces of law and order and the people of Northern Ireland and on the reputation of the United Kingdom. 
13 Their effect on the detainees Their immediate effect was on the detainees. 
physical effects and the mental effects. (a) 
Physical effects (i) 
It would seem unlikely that the procedures would not result in some minor physical injuries. 
11 men made complaints of physical 
ill-treatment and some of them who had no injuries on arrival at the interrogation centre were found by the Compton Committee to have had minor injuries when they left. 
We have had to consider both the Like the Compton Committee 
we have not seen any of the detainees and, like them, we cannot say how these injuries were occasioned. 
(ii) 
We have received unchallenged medical evidence that subjection to a noise level of 85 decibels (at the interrogation centre it was 85 to 87 decibels) for 48 hours might result for 8% in temporary loss of hearing and in 1% (with ear disorders) in some permanent loss of hearing.

’Since providing evidence to your Committee we have given much thought to the question of whether it might be possible to specify reasonably precise limits for interrogators and those having charge of internees. The aim of such limits would be to define the extent of any ’ill-treatment’ of suspects so that one could ensure with a high degree of probability that no lasting damage was done to the people concerned. After a further review of the available literature, we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that no such limits can safely be specified. 
Any procedures such 
as those described in the Compton Report designed to impair cerebral functions so that freedom of choice disappears is likely to be damaging to the mental health of the man. 
The effectiveness of the procedures 
in impairing willpower and the danger of mental damage are likely to go hand in hand so that no safe threshold can be set.’ 
(4) It appears to me that the recommendations made by my colleagues in the concluding part of their Report necessarily envisage one of two courses. 
One is that Parliament should enact legislation enabling a Minister, in a time of civil emergency but not, as I understand it, in time of war, to fix the limits of permissible degrees of ill-treatment to be employed when interrogating suspects and that such limits should then be kept secret. I should respectfully object to this, first, because the Minister would have just as much difficulty as Parliament would have in fixing the limits of ill-treatment and, secondly, because I view with abhorrence any proposal that a Minister should in effect be empowered to make secret laws: it would mean that United Kingdom citizens would have no right to know what the law was about police powers of interrogation. The other course is that a Minister should fix such secret

JOINT DIRECTIVE ON MILITARY INTERROGATION IN INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS OVERSEAS 
INTRODUCTION Persons arrested or detained during Internal Security operations or 
in near emergency situations are likely to be valuable sources of intelligence. They may be the only sources of intelligence at a time when it is urgently required. 
Successful interrogation depends upon careful planning both of the interrogation itself, and of the premises wherein it is conducted. calls for a psychological attack. 
2. It Apart from legal and moral considera- 
tions, torture and physical cruelty of all kinds are professionally unrewarding since a suspect so treated may be persuaded to talk, but not to tell the truth. 
Successful interrogation may be a lengthy process. 3. Any detainee therefore must be properly handled and treated from the 
moment of his arrest and adequate facilities provided for his interrogation. AIM

This will be more easily achieved by sustained interrogation in an It may therefore be necessary for interrogation 
to be carried out continuously for long periods both by day and by night with consequent disruption of the normal routine of living.

be seen daily by a Medical Officer and asked if they have any complaints; any allegations of cruelty or torture should be reported at once to the appropriate superior medical headquarters or senior responsible civil or military authority. Medical examinations should be mandatory on admission and discharge (including temporary transfers to or from a detention or other holding centre) and medical treatment available as required. 
The Medical Officer is to maintain a record of each person’s weight as recorded on admission and discharge.

COMMITTEE ON INTERROGATION PROCEDURES 
The Rt Hon Edward Heath MBE MP Prime Minister 
6 December 1971 Very many thanks for your letter of 2 December. I did so 
appreciate what you said in the last paragraph. The Committee have now met and have considered the terms of 
reference as given by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons and as set out in your letter to me of the 18 November. 
covering ordinary police inquiries into crime. 
We are a little concerned that some might read these terms as Terrorism no doubt 
connotes violence and violence for political ends but this might occur under ordinary conditions, e.g. violence by some body such as the Angry Brigade. 
We feel sure that you do not intend us to cover police 
interrogation under ordinary conditions but only interrogation under emergency conditions short of war such as prevail in Northern Ireland, e.g. where persons can be lawfully detained without trial. 
In these circumstances we would welcome a slight amendment to make the terms read as follows: 
"To consider whether, and if so in what respects - under conditions in which persons suspected of terrorism can be lawfully detained without trial in the traditional Courts - the procedures currently authorised for the interrogation of such persons and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment." 
This is, I fear, a little cumbersome but we have tried to keep as 
far as possible to what the Home Secretary said. If however any difficulty might be thought to attach to an amendment, 
we would be quite prepared to act on the original terms, stating in our Report what our understanding of them is 
coincides with your understanding. The Lord President has kindly agreed that we may use his office as 
an accommodation address and has provided notepaper. - always of course on the assumption that this

Ref. A0837 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland 
Standing Body for Investigation of Allegations (GEN 47(71) 4) 
The Meeting gave some preliminary consideration to this 
memorandum on 22 November; but a few new points have supervened in the interval:(a) The Police Authority are now thought to be vexed that no action has been taken on their recommendation. 
(b) The Government of the Irish Republic have decided to take us to Strasbourg. To set up a body on the lines envisaged might help our case; on the other hand it could now be construed as a concession to the Republic’s decision and a belated admission of an uneasy conscience. 
(c) A Board of Visitors is being set up at Long Kesh. This, however, is a separate issue, as the memorandum points out, since a Board would be concerned only with the treatment of internees while they were at Long Kesh. 
2. The appointment of a standing body might serve a useful purpose as 
a safety valve and afford some protection for the security forces themselves, even though the proven complaints are likely to be only a minute fraction of the wild allegations which the IRA propaganda machine is capable of pouring out. 3. 
If it is decided to set up standing machinery, however, the point at 
(b) on page 2 is important and should be explicitly endorsed by Ministers. As regards the other questions on page 2, the earlier meeting decided provisionally that one man was better than three, and that there is a strong case for limiting jurisdiction to complaints made by people who allege that they were maltreated. The question whether the Westminster Government should reserve a power to remit cases to the body is more arguable. Although this might have the advantage of flexibility, we should be under constant pressure to remit particular cases. 
(Your latest exchange with 
the Cardinal illustrates this). Would it not be best to be ready to change the terms of reference if a special situation arose?

position of the minority members of the Police Authority might be eased if the Authority’s request for a "continuing Compton" were granted at the same time as authority is conceded to the RUC to use automatic weapons outside the police stations. 
we concede that authority, we ought at least to consider extending the scope of any "continuing Compton" to include the RUC as well as the Army. But, if we rule against any extension of the use of automatic weapons by the RUC the point does not arise).

might be wise, in their own interests, to take power to remit cases for examination if the public pressure in any particular case becomes irrepressible. 
(e) Paragraph 4(e). We should repeat the Compton procedures i.e. hearings in private and no direct confrontation between the parties. 
(f) Paragraph 4(f). The machinery should end with internment. (4) Evidence to the Parker Committee. There are several points 
which have emerged from interdepartmental discussion of this subject and need to be settled before the Home Secretary sees Lord Parker on Tuesday. They are discussed in the attached copy of a submission of 18th November by Sir James Dunnett to the Secretary of State for Defence, as follows:(a) Should Sir Dick White give the Committee a copy of his recent report, in which he suggested possible modifications in the interrogation methods? The memorandum suggests that he should not do so at this stage. But both Sir Dick and the Home Office feel that, if he is asked by the Committee whether the Government have given any thought to this question, he should not withhold his own suggestions. 
(b) Should the Committee visit Northern Ireland? The memorandum suggests that we cannot refuse them permission to do so if they wish. The Home Office are more doubtful, partly on the grounds that their presence in Northern Ireland would constitute a considerable security problem but mainly because it would suggest that they were conducting a second inquiry into the Compton allegations. 
I think that this is right and that, if the 
Committee wish to see the GOC and the Director of Intelligence the latter must be brought to London for the purpose.

prepared by the MOD). 7. 
This in turn will load to the question of the results which interrogation as it is practised by the JSIW produces. Most of the 
information which is given to the Committee on this point will be derived from our experience in Northern Ireland not,only because it 
is most recent and of most immediate concern to the Committee but also because it is the best documented interrogation operation. But the Co-ordinator does not propose to say too much himself in thi preliminary briefing about the results obtained from interrogation in Northern Ireland because he thinks that this will come most 
effectively from the GOC, Northern Ireland, who can brief the Committee on the overall military situation in Northern Ireland as it was before the introduction of internment and as it is now, bringing out the general state of intelligence before interrogation was used and the improvement that has been achieved since. (BGS(Int) is already arranging for the GOC to be warned that he will probably be required to give evidence to the Committee and that he should be thinking about what he will say and who should accompany him: likely candidates are the D of I, the Chief Constable, the Head of Special Branch and* 
*(the RUC Inspector in charge of the 
interrogation centre). It is being made clear to the GOC that it will be for him to obtain the agreement of the Northern Ireland Government to the Chief Constable and other members of the RUC giving evidence.) As PUS knows, we are also preparing a paper for the Committee on the results obtained from interrogation in Northern Points for decision

has been arranged for tomorrow morning not only to give general approval to the line he is proposing to take in his opening evidence but also to give him guidance on the following detailed points.

The Secretary of the JIC is arranging for the D of I in Northern Ireland to prepare this paper. 
PUS’s Group will wish to consider whether all 
these papers should be submitted to the Parker Committee and whether there are any others that should be made available. In particular a decision is needed on whether the Co-ordinator should volunteer his report on interrogation methods of 5 November 1971 at an early stage or whether he should wait and see whether the Committee ask him what his views on methods are and then offer it. The dilemma here is that on the one hand to volunteer it might appear to the Committee to be an attempt by the Government to steer them to a particular conclusion, whereas not to offer it straightaway but to produce it at a later stage might suggest that we had been deliberately holding it back. My own feeling is that we should volunteer the report early on, making it clear that this was a domestic study which was carried out when we knew what Compton was likely to say but before we knew that there was to be an enquiry by Privy Councillors

SPEAKING NOTE FOR MINISTERS COMPTON REPORT: ARMY AND RUC VINDICATED In speaking about the Report of the enquiry into allegations against 
the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of the events of the 9th August, 1971, the following points might be made 
1. All charges of brutality against British troops and the RUC were demolished. Sir Edmund Compton’s Committee reported that it found no evidence of brutality, still less of torture or brain washin-. The great majority of allegations are either found not to have been proved or to have been untrue. 
2. The allegations examined by the Committee fell into two classes: those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concerned with the later process of interrogation. Arrests 
- 342 men were arrested on August 9 in a highly successful 
operation in very difficult circumstances. No force but the minimum necessary was used to achieve arrest. The men concerned were likely to resist arrest and many of them were likely to be armed; in these circumstances the army’s performance was highly creditable. 
Interrogation - Interrogations are carried out by the security forces upon principles laid down under the previous administration and confirmed by the present administration. 
Very difficult 
issues are involved in judging what methods of interrogation are permissible in the protection of the lives of the civil population and the security forces against a ruthless and deliberate campaign of terror and murder. 
That is why the Government has appointed 
a committee of Privy Councillors under Lord Parker to enquire into them and see whether changes are necessary. 
3. The whole operation, arrests followed by the interrogation of a small number of suspects (14),yielded information of great value without which the security forces could not defend the ordinary civilian against the campaign of terror and murder. 
4. The operation should be seen against the background of the fight against a ruthless and murderous enemy; that is to say criminals who ish to impose their will by violence and terror. This year there have been over 800 bomb explosions in Northern Ireland; hospitals have treated nearly 600 victims of violence; of these more than 200 were British soldiers; almost two thirds of the civilian casualties were women including girls disfigured for life in explosions. These things have been done by the IRA. 
Office of the Lord President of the Council 18th November, 1971.

COMPTON REPORT STATEMENT MR. REGINALD MAUDLING With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement. The Report of the Committee under the Chairmanship of 
Sir Edmund Compton which I set up to inquire into allegations against the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of events on 9 August is being published today and copies will be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m. For completeness I should add that at my request Sir E.Compton 
himself also investigated allegations in respect of three persons named in the Sunday Times issue of 17 October who were arrested after 9 August. Copies of this Supplementary report will also be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m. The rest of my statement is concerned only with the main report. The Government are grateful to the members of the Committee 
of Inquiry for the care and thoroughness with which they carried out their difficult task. Following the precedent of the Bowen report on Aden in 1966 
the report is published with an introduction by myself as Minister appointing the Inquiry. The Government have not found it necessary to omit anything from the Report on grounds of security and it is, therefore, published in full. The Compton Committee found no evidence of physical brutality 
by the British Army or the RUC, still less of torture or brainwashing. In the course of the arrest of 342 men on 9 August a small number of them suffered what the Committee describe as a measure of

4. On 23 January Protestant supporters of the Linfield football 
club, returning from a match in which their team had lost, clashed with the RUC, who had been trying to keep them on the move while passing the Roman Catholic Unity Flats area. The Army had to be called in and by midnight a crowd of about 150 had moved into the heart of the Shankill and built a barricade. The situation was quietened only four hours later. In all, the Army used 106 rubber baton rounds and suffered 11 minor casualties. Fourteen arrests were made. 
5. By 7 p.m. on 24 January a Protestant crowd of 350 gathered in 
the Shankill, close to the Catholic Falls area and had to be dispersed by the Army. They proceeded to stone the Tennant Street RUC station. Twenty-eight arrests were made during the evening and 20 baton rounds fired. 
6. Since the weekend there have been no serious disturbances in 
either Belfast or Londonderry. EXPLOSIONS 7. 
There have been a number of small explosions in various parts of 
Belfast but none has caused particularly serious damage. The use of incendiary devices continues. Six were discovered and successfully disarmed on 22 January and a further 2 on 26 January. Another was thought to have caused a small fire on 22 January. It is not known if these incidents are related or, if they are, who might be responsible for them. About 50 lbs. of explosives caused severe damage to Ministry of Health and Social Services offices in Enniskillen on 24 January. On 25 January 2 Republic of Ireland customs buildings situated at Lifford near Strabone were damaged, one extensively, by explosions. 
SPEECHES ON THE DISTURBANCES 8. 
On 22 January Mr. R. Bradford was reported as having said that 
the Ulster problem was simply that a substantial section of the community at best would only reluctantly acquiesce in British citizenship as a second choice and at worst hated it with a bitter hatred and would reject it with violence. That was why the British Army was attacked in Ballymurphy and the Ardoyne and "that is why this particular problem is a Catholic problem and why its solution is largely in the hands of the Catholic community". 
9. 
extremists for the recent disturbances. Opposition elements, including Mr. P. Devlin, and the Alliance Party, were able to make much of these speeches as a result of the trouble in the Protestant Shankill over the weekend. But the Northern Ireland Prime Minister issued a statement (reproduced in the Annex) condemning those responsible for the rioting and naming them as enemies of Northern Ireland. On 26 January Mr. Bradford appealed to Protestants not to play into the hands of the IRA. 
Mr. B. Faulkner, speaking the next night, blamed Republican

STORMONT DEBATE ON "LAW AND ORDER" MOTION 
10. The motion, reported in last week’s HONIP, paragraph 5, signed by 14 back-bench Unionist MPs, led by Mr. Joseph Burns and including Sir Robert Porter, was debated in the House of Commons at Stormont on 27 
January. The motion expressed complete support for the 
Government in bringing in "watever measures, however rigorous". An amendment to this motion was signed by Mr. Craig, Mr. West, Mr. Boal, Mr. Paisley, Mr. Beattie, Mr. Laird and Mr. McQuade. Only Mr. Laird, who was elected to the House last November (see HONIP(70) 47, paragraph 6) is a member of the Unionist Parliamentary Party. This motion accused the Government of consistently failing to deal with the origins of subversion in the community. The speeches were largely predictable, although Mr. Boal’s rejection of the use of internment (since it would strengthen what he described as the "weak, stupid and cowardly executive"), was unusual for its method of approach, though not its target. The motion without the Craig-West amendment was carried by 29 votes to 7. While this undoubtedly represents a parliamentary victory for Major Chichester-Clark albeit a not unexpected one, it is clear that at least some of the signatories to the motion saw it as an opportunity to put pressure on the Government to take yet tougher action against rioters. In his speech introducing the motion Mr. Burns had called for internment and the use of firearms in controlling disturbances. 
MEETING OF THE ULSTER UNIONIST COUNCIL 11. On 25 
January it was announced that a special meeting of the 
Council had been requisitioned by 170 of the 980 members of the Council, who wished it to consider a resolution calling for the resignation of the Government because of its failure to maintain law and order. Prominent among the signatures are those of Mr. Craig, former Minister for Home Affairs, and Mr. West, President of the West Ulster Unionist Council. It had been known for some time that Right-Wing critics of Major Chichester-Clark had obtained the required number of signatures, but they were thought to have held back from requisitioning a meeting because they were uncertain of their ability to win a majority (see HONIP(69) 39 paragraph 10). The officers of the Council will now consider when a meeting should take place. The annual meeting of the Council is due in March, and, as delegates have to be summond by letters, the postal strike may be a factor in the timing. Major Chichester-Clark has not yet reacted to the call for a meeting, but in the past he has said that he will continue in office so long as he has the confidence of the Parliamentary party. Much will depend on his ability to hold to this line, if the Unionist Council went against him. 
12. On 26 January supporters of Major Chichester-Clark announced 
that they had collected 250 signatures of Council delegates who would back the Government.

STATEMENT OF POLICING BY SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY (SDLP) 
13. In a statement on 22 January about the previous week’s disturbances in the Roman Catholic area of Ballymurphy, Mr. G. Fitt’s SDLP spoke of "certain elements who had been taking advantage of the troubled situation by engaging in crime and criminal activities", and expressed its support for an unarmed RUC. The SDLP called for talks between the people of the troubled areas of Belfast and the authorities to discuss "the proper policing of the areas by an acceptable police force". On 27th January Mr. Lynch, answering questions in the Dail, expressed his support for this initiative. 
DEBATE ON THE RE-ORGANISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
14. Continuing the debate (see last week’s HONIP, paragraph 16) the Minister for Health and Social Services announced that personal health and social services would become the responsibility of Ministers, with local administration being left to four area boards. Closing the debate, Mr. Brian Faulkner resisted firmly suggestions that the Fermanagh and Dungannon councils be suspended. He was prepared to consider any evidence which showed that either body was not operating correctly, but would not be rushed by threats into acting on no evidence. In addition, he made it clear that the Government, while maintaining an open mind on proportional representation, would not introduce it in time for the local elections in 1972. 
IMPRISONMENT OF MR. McMANUS MP 
15. The Civil Rights demonstration in Enniskillen on 23 January against the sentence passed on Mr. McManus (reported in paragraph 11 of last week’s HONIP) summoned only 200 people and passed off without incident. The Speaker of the House of Commons at Westminister was officially informed of Mr. McManus’ imprisonment, and Miss B. Devlin’s attempt to have the subject debated failed. At Stormont, Mr. J. Taylor (Minister of State, Home Affairs) referred to Mr. McManus’ previous conviction for a similar offence, for which he had been given a suspended sentence of imprisonment, and to the fact that six Protestants had been sentenced to 
imprisonment for breaking the ban on processions in September 1970. CHARGES ARISING FROM RIOTING IN JUNE 1970 
16. Of the four defendants acquitted of murder on 19 January (last week’s HONIP, paragraph 15) and still facing firearms charges, three were acquitted on 22 January. The jury disagreed on the fourth, who has been released on bail until March.

WESTMINSTER UNIONIST PROTEST 
17. Mr. Robin Chichester-Clark MP and Mr. Stratton Mills MP, after failing to vote in two divisions on the Industrial Relations Bill, issued a statement saying they had abstained deliberately to mark their dissatisfaction with the ineffectiveness with which the British Government had discharged its security role in Ulster. They reserved the right to continue so to do until the Westminster Government was fully committed to effective policies. A fellow Ulster Unionist, Mr. Kilfedder MP, subsequently issued a statement attacking his colleagues for the damaging effect their statement would have on the Northern Ireland Government. 
FORTHCOMING EVENT 
18. Mr. I. Paisley is organising a number of marches to take place in Belfast on 4 February to celebrate the lifting of the ban on processions. 
REPORT BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER FOR ADMINISTRATION 
19. Sir Edmund Compton, who is Parliamentary Commissioner for the Stormont Administration as well as that of Westminster, reported on his first 18 months work on 27 January. In this time he had been asked by 38 Stormont MPs to investigate 99 cases. He had rejected 58 as being outside his jurisdiction. Thirty-three were investigated and completed, of which only 2 were justified and the defects found in administration subsequently rectified. Eight were still under examination. In only 2 cases, both of which concerned employment in the Civil Service, was religious or sectarian discrimination suggested and neither had been substantiated. Sir Edmund praised the efficiency of the Northern Ireland Government departments.

One might at least consider, for an initial period of five years, having a Second House whose members were appointed by Her Majesty 
- which, after all, is the state of a House of Lords if there were only Life Peers. 
18. A change in the constitution of the Senate seems to me to be conceivably a ’good’ policy, and I recommend 
that consideration should be given to the possible detailed form, and the constitutional implications, of such a change. 
19. I next consider the possibility of a ’federal’ solution. This question is not of course one of devising ab initio a federal constitution for the whole of Ireland. There are two existing sovereign states; what we have to ask is what powers they might reasonably be able and willing to concede to a federal authority. 
20. One might conceive of the delegation to a Council of Ireland (of the kind proposed in the 1920 Act), or to a series of ad hoc bodies jointly appointed by worth and South, of powers over a number of specific

The difficulty is that this type of cooperation appears to be relevant to the main problem only if one supposes that the habit of working together, on limited practical matters, would gradually make it easier to relax the main tensions. As a policy to adopt about 1960, limited cooperation might have made sense; but I would judge it ineffective in relation to the serious problems of today.

8 December, 1970 
I think that on my return from leave I should send you an "atmosphere piece" in an attempt to describe how things have developed since early November. 
I do 
so because on coming back to Belfast I found a very different mood from that which obtained in, for instance, early October. 
2. situation, only really marred by bomb explosions. 
The background is, of course, a great improvement in the law and order The great majority of these 
are the work of the I.R.A., though the police ascribe two recent small bangs to the Protestant extremists who had been inactive for some months. 
But most of these have been pretty trifling affairs, without loss of life. But most 
importantly there has been quiet on the streets and even the NICRA march in Enniskillen did not lead to public disturbances. 
3. This is traditionally a quiet period of the year. The reasons for this calm are 
complex, and one can only guess at the relative importance of the various factors. Among these factors I. would particularly mention the following. 
There have been no important anniversaries or customary marches to inflame tempers. The Government 
is beginning to reap the rewards of its reformist policies and of its levelheadedness. 
In particular the Prime Minister’s assurances about one man, one vote 
and the possibility of proportional representation in bye-elections has earned the administration considerable credit with the minority, as did Brian Faulkner’s skilful handling of the Central Housing Authority Bill. Within the party, the fact that the moderates have begun to fight back and gain successes over the extremists has strengthened the Prime Minister’s hand and increased his confidence. He is in d buoyant and almost aggressive mood and actively seeks show-downs with the Right-wing. 
He was much disappointed that he was denied the opportunity of 
a confrontation when Paisley did not appear to speak to the motion of censure sponsored by Beattie, McQuade and himself over representations to H.M. Government in connexion with ’espionage’. 
He had intended to invite Paisley to cross the 
floor of the House so that he would be in a position to make his criticisms of the Government face-to-face rather than ’over the shoulder’. 
The net result of all 
this is that James Chichester-Clark is earning the respect, and almost the confidence of many of the leaders of the minority, while he is very much more the master in his own house in the Unionist Party. 
One of the most significant and 
welcome developments of the past few weeks is therefore the increasing isolation of the extremists on both wings. 
4. other ways. 
The self-confidence of the Administration is beginning to show itself in We can expect them to become increasingly less biddable towards 
Westminster over minor issues and more anxious to do things their own way. it is by no means an unhealthy development. 
But Secondly, there is a growing 
disposition to establish a direct dialogue with the Opposition and other leaders the minority. 
For example, next week Brian Faulkner will be dining privately 
with me to meet Cardinal Conway for the very first time, and the Prime Minister also proposes to meet him, probably at Hillsborough.

5. On the strictly security side, the withdrawal of all but three battalions 
from Belfast to the country-side has contributed to a greater appearance of normality in the city, while the Army’s growing success in uncovering arms caches is a source of general satisfaction to the law-abiding; and as the Army edges itself back towards the barracks, the morale of the R.U.C. continues to improve. They have a very long way to go before they earn the full confidence of the minority, but the process has begun. 
The major moan of the minority at It will be of immense benefit to the R.U.C.

arisen. 
Their next major campaign Hitherto, the Prime 
Minister, in public at least, has not put a foot wrong in the matter. He re-itera 
that if he is advised by his security advisers that internment is necessary, he is prepared to intern. 
At the same time he indicates that this situation has not yet The police at present are firmly of the opinion that internment would be 
counter-productive, since they believe that however many I.R.A. men were picked up, others would come forward in their places. 
In my own view (and Father Murphy has 
volunteered a like opinion) the real extremists would welcome the introduction of internment. 
It would reverse the process of their isolation from the general 
Catholic population and the insurrectionary atmosphere of last summer would be recreated. 
In this over-long letter, I have painted an optimistic picture, but the circumstances as they exist at this moment warrant mild optimism. 
7. I need however hardly add that the situation is still fragile. An important kidnapping, the 
murder by the I.R.A. of two or three soldiers, or an explosion which caused a large number of casualties, would set the clock back a long way. 
One single act of 
political folly (and this seems unlikely under Major Chichester-Clark’s eminently level-headed leadership) could similarly cause a major set-back. 
so many people in Northern Ireland (and indeed in Eire) with hot-blood and a vested interest in violence, we cannot be too complacent or over-confident.

It is proposed to give effect to this new policy, after the current ban expires on 31st January next, by a bridging order under the Special Powers Acts, to be followed fairly soon by fresh substantive legislation. It is further proposed that the policy should be explained as soon as possible, perhaps by the publication of a Green Paper. 4. 
Ideally I think we would all like to see an end to 
these processions, but I doubt whether this could be achieved voluntarily or could be enforced without widespread disorder. 5. 
The Defence Secretary and I think that what is 
recommended to the Northern Ireland Government is a moderate and sensible policy to which HMG can give their support. 6. I propose if you agree to instruct the UK representative in Northern Ireland to support this policy when it is considered by a special meeting of Major Chichester-Clark’s Joint Security Committee on 4th December; and I understand that the Defence Secretary intends to give the same instructions to the GOC. 7. 
I am sending a copy of this minute to the Defence Secretary and to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.

It was very kind of you to spare me so much time the other I greatly appreciate the efforts you are making to try 
to understand the widespread feeling of anxiety which Stratton Mills and I are trying to convey about what is felt in Ulster to be an attitude of ’benevolent neutrality’ on the part of the Government towards those who are labouring against considerable odds to lift Ulster out of her present political difficulties. 
I promised to set out some of the practical ways in which 
we think HMG might be able to give greater assistance. On the present trend of things I would estimate that by 
April or May next year the central bodies ie. the Standing Committee and Council of the Unionist Party, will be in the hands of those who are gathering round Messrs. Craig and West. 
The 
Stormont Government and those who support them are in desperate need of political help. 
majority that the present Stormont Government is able to ’stand up’ for Ulster and is not tied to dictation from Westminster will be politically helpful at this juncture. There are a number of ways in which HMG could make this clear. 
sources. 
First, there is the very sensitive question of information However unjustified, there is a widespread feeling 
abroad that the Home Office listens to representations of the minority and guards against offending its susceptibilities but does not so fully consider the effect of words and actions on the various groups which comprise the Unionist majority. 
For example, there was considerable anger felt recently 
when the local papers in Northern Ireland headlined the fact that industrial schemes, the promotion of which would be entirely matters for the N.I. Government, had been conveyed for examination to the Home Office direct. 
Or again a Written 
Answer to a Question on the constitutional position put by Miss Devlin contained wording which in the present situation 
suggests to many a change of Government policy, quite unwittingly. Similarly, last week in a Written Answer to Paisley, HMG’ s 
relations with the Irish Republic were described as continuing ’to be close and friendly’, which is a desirable state of affairs, but as a reply couched in such terms, in the aftermath of the Dublin Arms Trial, this offers immediate political capital to te right wing and makes it that much more difficult for those

MO 19/3/1 PRIME MINISTER 
NORTHERN IRELAND: FORCE LEVELS I have been giving thought to the level at which 
we should plan to maintain the force level in Northern Ireland during the period f rom next month to about April, 1971. 
2. You will recall that, at the time of our taking office, there were nine major units in the infantry role (this number having been built up during the first half of the year from a level of seven, the lowest it had been since the disturbances of 1969 broke out); and that we then approved plans to add a further five major units (subsequently increased to six), plus a number of supporting units, as temporary reinforcements to cover the period of the traditional large-scale marches and parades in the Province during July. In giving this approval we recognised that one effect would be to increase the number of major units which had had to be borrowed from BAOR, from two to three. 
3. As events turned out, it was not possible to withdraw all of these reinforcements by the end of July as we had hoped; the uneasy political atmosphere and security situation in the Province dictated a more gradual rate of reduction. Three units were withdrawn by the end of July, and two more at the beginning of September; at the latter stage, the number of units on loan from BAOR reverted to two. I have kept the level at ten until the end of this month in case of disturbances following Miss Devlin’s release from prison. 
4. For the six months after that, it can reasonably be hoped that the onset of winter and the absence from the calendar of major tribal functions will again result in a lower incidence of large-scale breaches of the peace

17 February 1971 Thank you for sending me your note of the weekend meeting 
at Chequers. The Home Secretary has suggested two amendments. The first is in line 14 of page 7: he would substitute the word "party" for "community". The second is at the bottom of page 8 where he suggests the final sentence should begin "It would be desirable if the Conference could include representatives of the political parties, but it should not degenerate 
.... ". Subject 
to these two amendments there is no objection to sending a copy of the note to Brian Cummings in Northern Ireland. 
In a separate letter of 15 February you refer to the dis- 
cussion of internment. The Home Secretary has commented that he himself told Major Chichester-Clark that the British Government had authorised the putting in hand of a contingency study of the practical problems of internment.

more help from the Metropolitan Police Special Branch. But it was difficult to penetrate the Catholic enclaves, and intimidation by the IRA was affecting not only the willingness of people to give information to the police but also the willingness of juries to convict. Major Chichester-Clark said that there were three 
possible sets of circumstances in which the Northern Ireland Government might be faced with the inevitability of a decision to introduce internment:(i) if the Government of the Republic started to intern; 
(ii) if the IRA proceeded to a campaign of political assassination; 
(iii) if it proved impossible otherwise to break the "wall of silence". 
He himself was against introducing internment, and so were the police. 
They would have to take in about 300 
to 400 people, but there would be a lot of younger people whom the police did not know and who would not be picked up. 
Introduction of internment would bring crowds into 
the streets again; all the Civil Rights demonstrators would be given a new cause, just as their old causes were disappearing; 
and there would be risks of kidnappings. Major Chichester-Clark had always made it clear that

it was for the Northern Ireland Government to decide whether to introduce internment, but that they would not do so without consulting the British Government. He agreed that the Home Secretary might include a sentence to this effect in his speech to the House of Commons on 15 February. 
There was a sound practical 
reason for this consultation: it would not be possible for the Northern Ireland Government to hold internees without the help of the British Government. at Belfast was full. 
The gaol It would perhaps be possible to 
accommodate 80 to 120 internees at Armagh, but additional security preparations would have to be made, and it would not be possible to conceal the fact that they were being made. 
One possibility would be to use a ship, 
for instance HMS MAIDSTONE; but this was not attractive as a long term solution. 
Another possibility might be 
to set up an internment camp on Rathlin Island, but the Army would need six to eight weeks to prepare such a camp and the preparations could not be kept secret. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said that, 
if it was judged that the problem was now one of dealing with a hard core of IRA terrorism, the time had perhaps come to reconsider the strategy for the security forces. At present the security forces had to fight the IRA on

INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
the Chief Constable - Major Chichester-Clark has been publicly asked from time to time 
in recent months whether he is contemplating internment. The standard reply which he has evolved is that his security advisers 
- to recommend it he would not hesitate to act. the GOC and 
do not recommend it at present, but if they were This is not an entirely 
satisfactory formula in that it might be read as an abdication by the Prime Minister of political responsibility for the decision. Home Office doubts on this score have been conveyed privately to the Secretary to the Cabinet and it is known that both the former GOC and the present Chief Constable feel that they are being publicly placed in a somewhat invidious position. There is however a clear and firm understanding between the two governments, frequently renewed and kept in good repair, that there could be no question of internment being adopted without full consultation with HMG. 
2. If internment were thought necessary the Northern Ireland Government 
would be in considerable practical difficulties. The advice of the security forces is that the numbers involved would be something between 350 and 450. 
There is no suitable prison building which could be 
used. The main prison in Belfast is full, and anyway being in the Crumlin Road is in an area which would present serious additional security problems. The only other prison in Northern Ireland, in Armagh, could only hold a fraction of the numbers 
- perhaps 80 - is dangerously near 
the border and in a part of the town which makes it particularly difficult to guard. High turrets completely bullet proof would have to be erected inside the prison and despite their protection would be a perpetual target for snipers. 
3. Internment camps could be got ready elsewhere in Northern Ireland 
notably in Rathlin Island, off the north coast, but the preparations would be obvious and their purpose clear. The consequent effect on the political and security situation would be most damaging, notwithstanding the statements made by Mr Lynch about his willingness to use similar powers in the south if necessary. 
4. In December 1970 in a period of comparative calm the Northern 
Ireland Government suddenly asked through the United Kingdom Government representative whether emergency contingency plans could be put in hand to make HMS MAIDSTONE, anchored in Belfast Lough, available as a place of detention for internees. HMS MAIDSTONE is a former submarine depot ship at present used to provide accommodation for troops. Both the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary found this proposition unattractive. The idea was somewhat too sensational and would immediately invite comparison with the hulks and would no doubt prove more photogenic than a prison or a barbed wire camp. 
5. As the Cabinet has recently noted, a decision to inter would need the most careful consideration. It is the view of the GOC and of the Chief Constable that even if all known activists were picked up, others at present unknown would immediately step into their place and recruitment to the IRA generally would receive further impetus. 
The current assistance being given by the Metropolitan Police to the RUC in the investigation into the death of John Kavanagh at the

end of last month is also an important factor. Although it is too soon for any clear or reliable indications of progress, the Commissioner of Police reports that the detective chief superintendent in charge of the case is not unhopeful that he may be able to get information which the RUC have been unable to get and perhaps go some way towards breaking the hold of the Brady gang. Even if he can penetrate the wall of silence which always obstructs the RUC in these cases, there will be formidable problems in protecting witnesses and juries from intimidation. Nevertheless this is the first new constructive approach that we have been able to put in hand: it is in line with statements by the two governments that subversive elements will be brought under the rule of the law: and to activate the internment powers would immediately bring to an abrupt halt the police enquiries. 
7. All that said, it is possible to envisage a campaign of assassination and perhaps kidnapping in which the two governments would find a popular demand for internment too great to resist. 
8. The recent active involvement of the IRA provisionals in 
attacks on the security forces and on civilians has led both the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to think it right to seek Ministerial authority to study the question of internment further. If a ship such as HMS MAIDSTONE were to be used it is preferable that it should be for as short a period as possible while other accommodation is being prepared. 
The Northern Ireland Government 
would need to be consulted because they would provide prison officers to guard the internees. 
9. If the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary agree they might 
wish to suggest to the Prime Minister that he might let Major Chichester-Clark know in confidence the HMG has authorised the putting in hand of a contingency study (rather than a contingency plan) dealing with the practical problems of internment in the course of which officials would be instructed to consult as necessary with the Northern Ireland Government. There is no doubt that this would be welcome news to Major Chichester-Clark. There is the inevitable 
risk, indeed likelihood, that some members at least of his government, will be encouraged to press hard for internment on the first plausible pretext once they know that the physical arrangements are under study. Nevertheless it seems right to put this in hand and Major ChichesterClark who has warmly welcomed the assistance now being given by the Metropolitan Police will be fully alive to the risk of putting this enquiry in jeopardy,and has shown in a number of his public statements that he is conscious of the repercussions not only of public opinion in Northern Ireland but internationally if internment were in fact to be undertaken.

Defense Secretary and to the Westminster Parliament, remains irksome. There is a marked reluctance, ostensibly on the ground of lack of time, to consult HMG before making statements of policy, sometimes announcing new measures - as exemplified on 9 February when without even consulting the COC or the Chief Constable, let alone HMG, a statement was broadcast saying that new regulations would be made under the Special Powers Act to deal with IRA wounded being removed from street battles by private ambulances and with the wearing of uniforms at funeral processions. 
5. Our aim however is to be as sympathetic and understanding as possible. Major Chichester-Clark is under great pressure not least from many who are nominally his supporters and his continuance in office for the foreseeable future is essential if a complete breakdown of law and order is to be avoided.

This 
co-operation might also extend to shared surveillance of the IRA? And, in this connection, what are Mr. Faulkner’s views about internment?

The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, M.P., Leader of the 
Opposition, came to see the Prime Minister at Chequers on Sunday, 21 March, 1971, at 11.00 a.m. to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister said that Major Chichester-Clark’s 
morale had seemed reasonably high when he visited Chequers five weeks earlier. At that stage he had not been pressing for further action by the Army, beyond an operation to pick up seven members of the I.R.A. who appeared in para-military uniform at the funeral of an I.R.A. man. This operation had been conducted and two of those concerned had been apprehended and convicted. When the Home Secretary went to Northern Ireland on 
5 March, he noticed a deterioration in Major ChichesterClark’s confidence. 
It was clear that the murder of the 
three British soldiers had made a great impact on him. He said himself that it had brought home to the general public the danger under which they all lay. His nerve had probably also been shaken by the subsequent marches, which might have been organised by the Reverend Ian Paisley. Major Chichester-Clark had not proposed internment; indeed he had made it clear that he was opposed to it, though his Right Wing wanted it. There were two substantial objections; the difficulties of finding a place to detain

the internees, and the risk of political criticism if it proved possible to apprehend only a few of those concerned and they were in turn replaced "from south of the border. The Prime Minister toll Mr. Wilson that the Government 
had in any case proposed to reinforce the troops for the Easter arches. Following Major Chichester-Clark’s visit, these reinforcements had been brought forward, and two battalions and a squadron were now in the process of moving to Northern Ireland. They would be available to deal with any disturbances which might follow Major Chichester-Clark’s resignation: r. Paisley had said that "every loyal Ulsterman would rise" if Mr. Faulkner was elected Prime Minister. Major Chichester-Clark had also suggested more 
intensive cordoning and more immediate reaction to terrorist incidents. To both of these the British Government had agreed. He had also suggested that units of the Army should be stationed permanently in the Catholic areas. The military advice had been very strongly against this proposal: it would tie troops down, would expose them to dangers to which they might have difficulty in reacting , and could affront the Catholics. On this point, the Government had given Major Chi chester-Clark no decision on 16 March; they had instructed the G.O.C. to form a military judgement and had told Major Chichester-

little more than a mixed-up student revolutionary. In response to further questions, the Prime Minister 
said that he had kept in constant touch with Mr. Lynch. He said that the Northern Ireland Government had powers 
to order internment, though Major Chichester-Clark had not wished to exercise them. Some members of the Ulster Defence Regiment were now operating full time and the Ministry of Defence were now looking at the possibility of a full-time battalion of the U.D.R. The Prime Minister said that he would be making a 
Statement in the House of Commons on the afternoon of 22 March. Mr. Wilson said that in reply he would make it clear that this was not a matter of dispute between the political parties in Westminster. Mr. Wilson said that he would make no statement to 
the press about the content of his meeting with the Prime Minister, which he would regard as governed by the Privy Counsellors’ oath.

against internment. 
Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the paper set out the arguments for and It appears that there are about 400 names on the list 
of potential internees, including not only IRA men but also extreme Protestants. But the Security Forces are not sanguine of being able to take more than 15 to 20 per cent of this total. 
It is conceivable that 
even to apprehend so small a percentage would nevertheless have some deterrent effect upon the remainder. But one cannot help thinking that it would not and that the reprisal effect would be more marked. 2. 
Government of the Irish Republic to reactivate internment powers (paragraph 3), it is thought to be too much to hope that he would be prepared to do so specifically to match an effort on our part (see paragraph 5 of NI(71) 2). 3. 
Although Mr. Lynch sometime ago announced the readiness of the We have been told that Major Chichester-Clark is not pressing 
for these powers and would not do so unless the Security Forces advised him to do so. But what if political pressure causes him to change his mind? The Committee will need not only to consider the weight of the arguments in paragraphs 5 and 6 on their own merits but also to be ready to consider them in the possible context of strong pressure on us to save Major Chichester-Clark’s Government by agreeing to internment. 
In 
other words is internment, with all its disadvantages, preferable to direct rule ?

Northern Ireland Contingency Planning (NI(71) 1) 
The Official Committee examined this paper at their meeting on 
15th March (attended by General Tuzo) and were broadly satisfied with it. Two further steps, however, were taken following that meeting. Arrangements are now being made to earmark individuals to reinforce the intelligence organisation when required; and a Ministry of Defence team is being despatched to examine the accommodation possibilities if a policy of internment is adopted. 2. 
It might be best to confine discussion to the purely military aspects 
and to discuss such matters as legal problems (Items 3 and 4 of the Annex) under the Civil Contingency Planning item on the agenda. 
Military points 
which Ministers may like to discuss on the Ministry of Defence conclusions are:(a) The timeliness and adequacy of the proposed reinforcement (Item 13). 
Is 15 major units enough, as well as being the "maximum practicable"? And how long would it take for the troops to be there, if the order were given tomorrow? (b) The study of security of frontiers (Item 15). The Committee will 
want to know when the study will be finished and perhaps to direct that it should also comment (see the brief on NI(71) 2) on the possible value of assistance from the forces of the Irish Republic. (c) The timing of all the various "planning" references (e. g. Items 16, 
17 and 21). 29th March? Will all these plans be ready to put into effect on or before

for a fresh attempt to rationalise the relationship between the two parts of Ireland. 
In fact, this could conceivably be the right moment for the imaginative 
political initiative which will certainly be needed, sooner or later, if we are not to face either the indefinite continuance of the present precarious and expensive deadlock or something even worse. It may be hopeful in this context that Mr. Faulkner said, during the recent Debate on the Address, that "... we will be glad to discuss further with the Irish Republic on a basis of mutual respect any realistic measures of co-operation which would be of benefit to both economies". The Marches and the General Security Situation 4. 
You will want to take stock of the general security situation. From 
all accounts the run up to 12th July has so far been relatively satisfactory; and processions which were the occasion of disorder last year have passed off comparatively calmly this year. The Secretary of State for Defence is sending military reinforcements for the main marching season; but the Committee will wish to satisfy themselves that all the precautions which can be taken for 12th July in Belfast and 12th August in Londonderry have been, or are being, taken. 
(See Dublin telegram No. 223 of 1st July. Can 
we do anything to prevent, or at least reduce, the Protestant reinforcements from Liverpool and Glasgow?). Internment 5. 
You will want to hear from the Home Secretary and the Secretary of 
State for Defence whether the attitude of the Northern Ireland Government and the security forces to internment remains broadly the same as when the matter was last considered; and how contingency planning for the camp at Long Kesh now stands. Miscellaneous Outstanding Points 6(a). The team to conduct the economic survey which was mentioned at your meeting with Mr. Faulkner has now been named. It is to be led by Sir Alec Cairncross; and Mr. Villiers, formerly managing director of the IRC, and Mr. Darwin Templeton, a Belfast accountant, are to join him. What timetable is envisaged for their report? (b) You also discussed with Mr. Faulkner a more vigorous cleaning 
up of Belfast; and he mentioned some measures to this end in the Debate on the Address. Are they sufficient? (c) The United Kingdom Representative, who is now assisted by two Principals and supporting secretaries, is, we understand, to move very shortly to his new quarters. The Home Office say that the team is now strong and well balanced and is working very satisfactorily.

of his own extremists and Mr Paisley for re-arming the Police, internment and the resurrection of the B Specials. He shows an understanding of the problems confronting the Army and a desire to work cooperatively with the Army Command. He has worked hard, and with considerable success, to reduce the number of marches to be held in the next three months. 
economic cooperation with the Irish Republic. 
He is firm in his wish to develop cross-border But all 
this is of small avail unless he can show that he is determined to bride the tribal gap; 
responsibility to secure the general good; 
that he recognizes a Prime Minister’s that he is not 
simply the leader (some would say the captive leader) of a Unionist Party permanently in power. 11. 
I suspect that Mr Faulkner could be more efficiently 
served by parts of his own Government machine and I have already indicated that some of his Ministers are not sufficiently house-trained. 
If this is so it is a reflection on Mr Faulkner himself. It begins to look as if he lacks that 
authority, combined with a hint of menace, which a leader needs. It suggests that he is not the tough man we hoped to see. 12. 
Whether or not Mr Faulkner is up to scratch we 
have to make the best we can of him, and I think he can be got to do a tolerable job if we handle him right. 
The 
heart of the matter is his assessment of the pressures which bear upon him, and his resolution in pursuing a policy appropriate to the problems of Northern Ireland and acceptable to the United Kingdom Government. 
He is a short-term 
thinker and if he assumes, as I think he does, that the problem of the minority is first and foremost a problem of

PRIME MINISTER POSSIBLE INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND At your meeting at the end of last month to discuss 
Northern Ireland, it was agreed that the Home Secretary and I should have further discussions with the object of finding funds for the construction of a camp at Long Kesh which could be used to house internees if it were decided to bring in internment. 
2. It is clear that the Northern Ireland Government are 
precluded by practical difficulties from contributing to the project, at least at this stage; and the Home Office have no authority to finance such accommodation in Northern Ireland. I am a little hesitant about whether it is appropriate to finance it from Defence Votes but, given the importance of making a start on the camp as quickly as possible, I would not wish to spend further time on looking for other ways to fund it. 
3. I am therefore giving instructions that the necessary 
financial arrangements should be put in hand for the project to be paid for, at least initially, out of Defence Votes. I hope the work can begin by the end of the month. 
the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to Sir Burke Trend. 
I am sending copies of this minute to the Home Secretary, 21st May 1971

rivalry and the opposition of women in the area, backed by the local Citizens’ Defence Committee, who condemned the affair as a 
"public orgy". A pirate radio station, broadcasting republican music and propaganda, operated for a short time on Friday and Saturday. 
COURT PROCEEDINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
11. One of the three men arrested on 16 April and charged with possessing explosives (see HNIP(71) 15 paragraph 16) was released by Belfast Magistrates’ Court after it had been learnt that evidence would not be offered against him. He is Brian Burns. The other two men, Francis Card and William McKee, who have refused legal representation, as is the custom with IRA defendants, were remanded in custody. 
12. Bernard Falk, the BBC reporter alleged to have interviewed Patrick Martin on a ’24 Hours’ programme (see last week’ s HONIP paragraph 9), announced that he had abandoned his appeal because of the strain in waiting for it to be heard, and began his four day sentence in Crumlin Road prison. He was released this morning. On Monday the case against Martin was adjourned until after Falk’s appeal had been heard and Martin released on bail. It is now likely that the proceedings against Martin will go ahead some time in the next few weeks during which Falk could again be called as a witness. 
CIVIL RIGHTS CAMPAIGN 
13. A petition said to contain 100,000 signatures was handed in to No. 10 Downing Street on 5 May by a delegation led by Lord Brockway. The petition calls for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland to be enacted in the Westminster Parliament. 
Among other things, the Bill would extend the Race Relations Act to Northern Ireland, forbid Stormont to legislate on matters covered now by the Special Powers Acts and introduce a system of proportional representation in parliamentary elections in Northern Ireland. A motion under the 10-minute rule seeking leave to introduce such a Bill will be moved by Mr. Arthur Latham in the House of Commons on 12 May and on the same day Lord Brockway will introduce a similar Bill in the Lords.

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE DISCUSSIONS WITH MR FAULKNER ON 1ST APRIL 
1. 
Improved surveillance of the Border Terms of reference for a study by the GOC Northern Ireland of questions 
relating to the security of the land border were sent to him on 8th April, after interdepartmental discussion. A copy is attached. Customs prepared a detailed note, and the GOC has been told to consult 
the top Customs official in Northern Ireland in carrying out his study. The Home Office is currently considering the implications of raising a full-time Ulster Defence Regiment battalion. This would involve legislation. 
2. 
Curfews The GOC is considering greater use of curfews, in consultation with the 
Joint Security Committee. 3. 
Identity cards The Home Office has put to the Northern Ireland Government a possible 
scheme for the use of identity cards to improve the control of the Border. The views of the Northern Ireland Government are awaited. It is clear that they see difficulties. 
4. 
Contingency study on internment accommodation The results of the contingency study have been given to Northern Ireland. 
At a discussion with officials on 16th April, the Northern Ireland representatives said that (i) it was not practicable to plan to use prison accommodation for internees; (ii) there was much to be said for the use of "Maidstone" to meet a short-term emergency; and (iii) to construct an internment camp at Long Kesh represented the most feasible solution. They promised to obtain the

View of Northern Ireland ministers, especially on the problems of staff and finance, so that the discussion could be resumed at an early date. 
5. 
Joint Economic Study The Northern Ireland Government proposals on the form and scope of 
this study have been received, and were discussed at official level at the Treasury on 19th April. The Northern Ireland representatives have undertaken to clarify their proposals further. 
6. 
Representation in EEC negotiations No new developments to report. 
7. 
Firearms Mr Faulkner has not yet taken a definite decision not to license any 
more new rifle clubs. He is being pressed on this, but anyway would wish to make the first announcement in Stormont when it resumes. 
8. 
Accommodation for United Kingdom Representative A suitable house is being bought. Two Principals and supporting staff have been allotted for the UK 
Representative’s Office. 9. 
Public prosecutions The Northern Ireland Government have just published a report of the 
Working Party. They propose to adopt a system based on the model of our Director of Public Prosecutions for summary offences, but are reserving for further consideration the handling of indictable offences. The Home Office will be entering into discussions with the Northern Ireland Government and hope that there will be speedy progress.

DEATH OF ANTHONY HENDERSON 13. 
It was announced on 4 April that a man named Anthony Henderson 
had been accidentally shot while training in the Wicklow Mountains in the Irish Republic. He was said to be a member of a Northern unit of the Provisional (Brady) group of the IRA and had an address in the Andersonstown district of Belfast. 
The Irish Republic’s Government information bureau issued Both IRA factions strenously 
denied that the incident might have occurred as a result of internecine rivalry. 
a statement saying "With regard to the death of the young man which allegedly took place in the course of illegal military training, the Government wishes to make it clear that every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, to stamp out these illegal activities." The inquest on Henderson in Dublin held on 5 April, was adjourned for further investigation by the Garda after the coroner had said that there was insufficient evidence for him to be able to say whether the death was accidental or not. Newspapers reported that the Garda Special Branch and uniformed police searched an empty house about 50 miles from Dublin and found evidence of bloodstains. No statement was issued but it was reported that the search for information about the incident continues. 
14. On 6 April the body was driven in procession from Dublin to the Henderson’s hone in the Andersonstown district of Belfast. The cortege of 35 cars crossed the border south of Newry and received close RUC supervision during its journey to Belfast. The cortege was stopped outside Newry and searched, but nothing was found. About 2,000 people saw the coffin brought to the church, but there were no incidents. The funeral on the following day also passed off quietly. About 1,000 people followed the hearse to the Milltown cemetery on the outskirts of Belfast and about 300 moved to the graveside, including eight men in combat jackets and one or two in berets. Two men were arrested after the ceremony, and details of this are given in the following paragraph. 
IRA ARRESTS 
15. Following the funeral of Anthony Henderson on 6 April the RUC arrested two men. One man, Patrick Martin of Dunmurry, appeared in court on 8 April charged with joining the IRA, an organisation prohibited under the Special Powers Act and also for promoting the objects of the IRA by taking part in a BBC ’24’Hours’ television programme on 19 January. The television networks have cone in for some criticism for screening interviews with people claiming to be members of the IRA but this is the first tie court proceedings have been brought as a result of one of these interviews. The other man, Joseph McCann, has since been discharged. 
16. On Wednesday evening, three men, Francis Card, William McKee and Brian Burns, were arrested after a raid on a house in the Roman Catholic Ardoyne area of Belfast. They have now been charged 
with possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. All the men are known to be prominent members of the Provisional (Brady) 
faction of the IRA

Firearms 
MR. FAULKNER said that he had called for the surrender of weapons and had declared an amnesty in respect of criminal prosecutions. He had also instructed the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to arrange for all revolver licencees to be visited and asked to justify their need for a revolver. There was no evidence that arms held under licence had been used for improper purposes, and the matter was therefore one of some political delicacy. No new permits had been issued for rifle clubs for some time, and he would take an opportunity of making that fact publicly known. 
Processions 
MR. FAULKNER said that, although he wanted to reduce the number of processions and remove the possibility of dangerous confrontations, he was not proposing a general prohibition of processions. 
If, however, 
organisers of processions insisted on taking routes that would involve dangerous community confrontations, he would not hesitate to prohibit a particular procession or compulsorily to alter its route. 
Only a small 
number of the parades due to be held over Easter were likely to cause difficulty, and measures wore in hand to deal with them. 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING confirmed that he had sufficient resources to deal with any trouble that might arise. 
Internment 
MR. FAULKNER said that he would not agree to any proposal for the use of the internment powers in the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts, unless he was advised by the Army and the police that internment would bring IRA terrorism decisively to an end. The General Officer Commanding had indicated to him that he was against internment and the Chief Constable also, although he had reported that the Special Branch of the RUC were marginally in favour of it. - Although the use- of internment on both sides of the Border appeared to have been a significant factor in bringing IRA terrorism to an end in 1962, the IRA campaign then was of a different character to their present operation and he himself was not in favour of internment at this juncture. There would be advantage in bringing in a number of suspects for questioning, but that too would entail the use of special powers of detention which he was anxious to avoid. He agreed nevertheless that it would be prudent to have plans ready, should internment have to be resorted to. 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING said that HMS Maidstone Could be used only temporarily; a reconnaissance had been carried out, and it was recommended that a site at Long Kesh was the most suitable site for constructing a camp for internees.

It would take 4 or 5 months If it

THE PRIME MINISTER said That th United Kingdom Government would consider urgently whether work should be begun at Long Kesh, 
Intelligence 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING said that he thought that the intelligence arrangements and the relationships between the various agencies were improving. 
In particular the performance of the 
Special Branch of the RUC had shown signs of substantial improvement. More military intelligence officers and liaison officers had been posted to Northern Ireland. 
MR. FAULKNER said that he thought that the intelligence services were improving and had shown some god results recently, 
He 
would like to consider whether there was a need to call for further assistance from the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister assured him that any such request would be sympathetically considered. 
Other Matters affecting Public Order 
MR. FAULKNER said that, in his capacity as Minister of Home Affairs, he had set up a small unit under the direction of Mr. Stout, which could devote its whole attention to reviewing the security situation and advising on measures that might be taken within agreed policy. 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING said he welcomed the formation of this unit. 
MR. FAULKNER said that there might be advantage in introducing majority verdicts into the procedure of the criminal courts in Northern Ireland, but it would require legislation at Westminster, and he understood that it was under consideration in London. The report of a Committee that had been considering the system of prosecutions in Northern Ireland would be published shortly. The Northern Ireland Government favoured public prosecutions undertaken by some agency other than the police. 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
THE PRIME MINISTER invited Mr. Faulkner to outline any points he wished to make about the state of the Northern Ireland economy. 
MR. FAULKNER said that the Northern Ireland Government were very grateful for the help that the United Kingdom Government had already given over such matter’s as industrial incentives. The future of the 
Province depended upon a strengthening of the economy and, while any fundamental improvement would have to wait upon the re solution of the current law and order problems, a fair amount of groundwork could,

YOU SHOULD NOT THEREFORE MAKE ANY REFERENCE TO IT AT ALL EXCEPT IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH MR. LYNCH. 2. MR. LYNCH REFERRED IN THE CONVERSATION TO AN INCIDENT IN WHICH A REFUGEE FROM NORTHERN IRELAND CAME ACROSS THE BORDER SAYING THAT THE BRITISH ARMY HAD BEEN PROTECTING HIM UP TO A CERTAIN TIME BUT THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ABOUT 60 ARMED AND MASKED MEN HAD COME ROUND AND ORDERED HIM TO GET OUT OR ELSE. SO HE HAD DONE SO. THE PRIME MINISTER REPLIED THAT THE GOC AND THE ARMY IN BELFAST WERE ALWAYS GLAD TO INVESTIGATE INCIDENTS IF THEY COULD BE GIVEN PRECISE INFORMATION ON WHICH TO DO SO. PLEASE SAY PRIVATELY TO MR. LYNCH THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS INCIDENT ENQUIRED INTO AND THAT HE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO BE GIVEN PRECISE DETAILS SO THAT THIS COULD BE DONE.

HE DID NOT RULE OUT A SUGGESTION THAT IN THE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE MEETING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE PRIME MINISTER MIGHT BE BROUGHT FORWARD. IF THE SITUATION JUSTIFIED BRINGING THE MEETING FORWARD, HE WAS SURE THAT IT WOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD. HE BELIEVED THAT MR HEATH WOULD REACT SYMPATHETICALLY TO A SUGGESTION THAT IT SHOULD. 13. ASKED IF HE MIGHT NOT BE ACCUSED OF HYPOCRISY WHEN HE DEMANDED LIBERALISATION OF THE NORTH WHILE BEING ACCUSED OF INTRODUCING REPRESSIVE LEGISLATION IN THE REPUBLIC (A REFERENCE TO THE FORCIBLE ENTRY BILL), MR LYNCH SAID THEY WERE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. IN THE REPUBLIC, THERE WERE DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES, THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION, THERE WAS DEMOCRACY. THERE WAS NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE STATES NORTH AND SOUTH. IN THE NORTH, REPRESSION WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THE MINORITY AND HE DID NOT ACCEPT THAT THERE WAS IN ANY WAY A PARALLEL BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE REPUBLIC. 14. AS FAR AS THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WERE CONCEREND. THEY WERE NOT CONTEMPLATING THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT IN THE SOUTH.

HE REFUSED TO SAY WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED, AT THE LONDON TALKS ON 11 AUGUST. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS WERE GOOD DURING THE WILSON GOVERNMENT’S TERM OF OFFICE. THEY HAD BEEN GOOD SINCE MR HEATH CAME TO POWER. THEY WERE NOW EXACTLY THE SAME. 16.

HOME SECRETARY’S MEETING WITH MR. FITT AND MR. HUME the Home Office. 
On Wednesday 11th August the Home Secretary saw Mr. Fitt and Mr. Hume at Mr. Angel was also present. 
Mr. Hume began by formally asking that all internees should be released. 
If this could not be done he asked for assurances about the conditions in which they were to be kept and complained that Members of Parliament had been denied access to them. 
According to his information most of those arrested were 
people publicly identified with the Republican movement over a long time rather than those active in violence. Mr. Fitt asked that where it was established that innocent people had 
died as a result of the recent violence, their families should be compensated. He said that Catholics were incensed at the army’s methods of searching which involved wrecking any premises they searched. 
he described as a British army handbook quoting an alleged Sinn Fein oath to ’wade knee deep in Protestant blood’. Mr. Hume then said that the main purpose of their visit was to put He and his colleagues deplored the violence on the They had tried to lead their communities

away from violence, even to the point of being stoned by their own supporters. The Provisional IRA was born in 1969 as a reaction to the Protestant attack on the Falls Road. 
As the situation had developed the opportunities for 
moderation had diminished and even their cautious welcome for Mr. Faulkner’s initiative on Parliamentary committees had led their constituents to accuse them of selling out. 
They could not now go back to Stormont. He referred to a document which Indeed they

Following is the draft of a statement to be televised b 
Mr. Faulkner and issued. Begins. 
1. If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things 
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and social development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of good will, hoever divergent their legitimate political views, 
may participate to the full. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy. 2. 
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry then out. 3. 
Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have much methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. 4. 
I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as minister of Home Affairs. 
5. Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the 
security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing that to public order and safety. This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the polic in respect of each such person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

of access to an advisory committee, which will hear representations for release and make recommendations to me. 6. 
I have taken this serious step solely for the protection 
of life and security of property in Northern Ireland. At all times I have consistently emphasized that it was not a step towards which I would be moved by any political clamour. Equally, I cannot now allow the prospect of any misrepresentation to deflect me from my duty to act. 
7. This is not action taken against any responsible and las- 
abiding section of the community. Nor is it in any way punitive or indiscriminate. Its benefits should be felt not least in those areas where violent men have exercised a certain sway by threat and intimidation over decent and responsible men and women. 8. 
The main target of the present operation is the Irish 
Republican Army.which has been responsible for recent acts of terrorism, and whose victims have included Protestant and Roman Catholic alike. They are the present threat: but we will not hesitate to take strong action against any other individuals or organisations who may present such a threat in the future. 9. 
It is with understandable reluctance that one uses these 
exceptional powers, but the organisations concerned are those which have murdered in cold blood, created situations which have led to death or injury to people quite uninvolved in disorder, maimed numerous people including young children and put at risk the jobs and the whole future of ntire communities. I ask those who will quite sincerely consider the use of internment powers as evil to answer honestly this question:Is it more of an evil than to allow the perpetrators of these outrages to remain at liberty? I cannot guarantee that the action we have now taken will bring this campaign swiftly to an end. We may yet have much to endure as a community: but if we endure it with courage and steadiness, the utter defeat of terrorism is sure.

10. That’s the aim we must now put before everything else, and for this reason I have also decided that the security forces must not, at this critical tie, be diverted from their essential tasks. Because of this, and taking into account also the further, damage which any serious public disorder however occasioned. would do to commerce, industry and indeed the community as a whole I have today made an order prohibiting all processions troughout Northern Ireland, with the exception of customary remembrance day parades organised by ex-servicemen’s organisations, for a period of six months. Thereafter I will review the position in the light of circumstances prevailing at that time.

11. I am sorry that this decision will inevitably interfere 
with rights and traditions cherished by many people, but I mut ask all concerned to accept it as truly necessary in the vital interests of th e country. We are, quite simply, at war with the terrorist, and in a state of war many sacrifices have to be made, and made in a co-operative and understanding spirit. 12. The action we have now taken does not indicate any policy of repression. We are acting not to suppress freedom, but to allow the overwhelming mass of our people to enjoy freedom including freedom from fear of the gunman, of the nightly explosion, of fire-raising, of kangaroo courts and all the apparatus of terrorism. The rest of us cannot truly be free while people determined to commit such outrages are at large. 13. In particular, I want to say a wrd directly to my Catholic fellow-countrymen. 
I do not for one moment confuse your 
community with the IRA or I imagine that these acts of terror have been committed in your name or with your approval. I have always had great respect for the god-fearing people. Albeit with political views different from.my own - I have met in every part of Ulster. I respect the way in which your religious leaders, and many of your public representatives, have outspoken condemned violence as immoral.

to come out and join us in building this community up again: not to restore it simply to what it was, for many of us in the past have failed each other, but to build it on better, sounder and stronger lines. Unless you take the place in our community which awaits you, all of us will be the losers. My door is open to any of your leaders, political or religious, who want to discuss how we can now move forward.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS ISSUED ABOUT 9 PM THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF THE TAOISEACH. 
QUOTE. 
DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT MERELY TO PREVENT THE DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH BUT TO OBTAIN THE IMPLEMENTATION THERE OF SUCH POLICIES AS WOULD PROVIDE AND PROTECT THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE NON UNIONISTS IN THE POPULATION 
. WE HAVE 
REPEATEDLY EXHORTED THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES TO COMPLETE THIS TASK WITH THE UTMOST SPEED AND IN FULL MEASURE. WE HAVE ASKED THE NORTHERN MINORITY TO BE PATIENT AND TO ACCEPT THATIT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO HONOUR THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION OF 19TH AUGUST 1969. WE HAVE ALSO ASKED THEM TO REJECT THE USE OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE NOT ONLY WOULD VIOLENCE PRECLUDE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS BUT IT WOULD PERPETUATE THE DIVISIONS AMONG THE IRISH PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE ACTED WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND RESTRAINT THROUGHOUT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEPAST TWO YEARS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE NORTH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS NOW COMPELS US TO STATE OUT POSITION WITH COMPLETE CLARITY. 
THE VIOLENT REACTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL IN THE NORTH, WHICH IS SEEN TO BE A DELIBERATE DECISION BY THE STORMONT ADMINISTRATION TO ATTEMPT THE OUTRIGHT REPRESSION OF THE MINORITY, IS NOT SURPRISING. BUT MY GOVERNMENT MUST MAKE DECISIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE REALITIES THAT EXIST: PARTICULARLY SO WHEN EMOTIONS RUN HIGH. THESE REALITIES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE MAIN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE PEOPLE IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY VICTIMISED BY THE STORMONT SYSTEM. IT IS ALREADY THE CASE THAT INNOCENT WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN 
OF PEACE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES SINCE MONDAY. IT IS NOT THE WISH OF THE GOVERNMENT TO BE IN ANY WAY A CAUSE OF AN ESCALATION OF AN ALREADY GRAVE SITUATION OR TO SEE ANY ADDITION TO THE TOLL OF DEATH, UNJURY AND DESTRUCTION. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT 
, THEREFORE, 
CONDONE ANY ACTIONS WHICH WILL LEAD TO SUCH AN ESCALATION AND CANNOT AND WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY ARMED ACTIVITY WHICH WILL INEVITABLY CAUSE FURTHER SUFFERING AND DEATH. 
WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH ELECTED LEADERS OF THE NORTHERN MINORITY IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. WE ARE UNITED WITH THEM IN OUR DETERMINATION TO ENSURE THAT THE MISGOVERNMENT TO WHICH THE NORTH HAS BEEN SUBJECTED FOR SO LONG SHALL END. THE BEST METHOD OF ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE IS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS. WE HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THE SUBJECTION OF THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH TO UNJUST LAW, BIASED ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE WILL COME TO A CONCLUSION THROUGH DETERMINED POLITICAL ACTION. 
WE HOPE THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL COME TO REALISE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND IS NOW AND HAS BEEN SINCE IT WAS CREATED DIRECTED AT THE SUPPRESSION OF THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE POPULATION. WE KNOW THAT THE BRITISH PUBLIC, IF FULLY AWARE OF THE FACTS, WOULD TURN AWAY IN HORROR FROM WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SUPPORT, FINANCIAALLY AND OTHERWISE, ALL THESE YEARS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THE CASE CAN BE SIMPLY STATED. THERE EXISTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND A GOVERNMENT WHOSE MAIN CONCERN APPEARS TO BE TO MEET THE WISHES AND DEMANDS OF THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS WITHIN THE UNIONIST COMMUNITY. THAT GOVERNMENT IS HEADED BY ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION WHICHGUARANTEED EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IRRESPECTIVE OF POLITICAL VIEWS OR RELIGION. DURING THE TWO YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DECLARATION HAS BEEN DELAYED AND DISTORTED. 
WHATEVER WERE THE INTENTIONS EMBODIED IN THE DECLARATION IT NOW HAS NO CREDIBILITY FOR THE NON-UNIONIST POPULATION AS THEY CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF THE INFLUENCE AND EVEN CONTROL EXERCISED ON THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT BY UNIONIST EXTREMISTS. 
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE SATISFIED THAT, AS AN IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF POLITICAL ACTION, THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY AN ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH POWER AND DECISION-MAKING WILL BE EQUALLY SHARED BETWEEN UNIONIST AND NON-UNIONIST. 
THE STORMONT REGIME, WHICH HAS CONSISTENTLY REPRESSED THE NONUNIONIST POPULATION AND BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECURRING VIOLENCE IN THE NORTHERN COMMUNITY, MUST BE BROUGHT TO AN END. WE CALL ON ALL IRISH PEOPLE, NORTH AND SOUTH, WHO ARE OPPOSED BOTH TO REPRESSION AND VIOLENCE TO JOIN TOGETHER IN POLITICAL ACTION AIMED AT THIS OBJECTIVE. 
THIS IS A SURER ROAD TO PEACE WITH JUSTICE THAN SELF-DESTRUCTIVE VIOLENCE.

PRIME MINISTER But it means of course 
t your minority and my 
minority would also have to be in. I do not know whether you would like that sort of approach, but it is either an approach between governments - if there were to be an idea of a summit - or it is to be an approach of all bodies and that would mean minority political parties, minority groupings, religious groupings and so on. 
MR. LYNCH I know it is very difficult to determine who 
represents what and who should be there. PRIME MINISTER But I think the overwhelming thing too of any of 
these sorts of meetings, applies to all sorts of summits that perhaps failure is worse than not to have it at all and you cannot ensure success until everyone has agreed what the answer is. 
MR. LYNCH Well, it is very difficult for us to have a summit 
without a reasonable prospect of some kind of the product and that would mean in effect a political product, so to speak. And I doubt if Mr. Faulkner would be very much interested in a summit of that nature. 
PRIME MINISTER I think his view has been right from the time he 
became Prime Minister as you know that he wanted to have more contacts with you and with Dublin and to build them up gradually. And the whole point about internment is to deal with the terrorism so that it is then possible to make the advance on other fronts. Until he is able to deal ith the bomb explosions and the destruction of property and the general terrorism it is impossible for him to go further than he has gone already. 
MR. LYNCH And of course there is this difficulty, that producing 
these results now, in the light of the activities of the IRA in the north, could be attributed to their activities rather than to reasonable and reasoned discussion. That is a big difficulty we have her with the Opposition M.P.’s having opted out of parliament and the IRA having taken over. 
having expended themselves not only in personnel, in will and possibly in warfare material, that as somebody says the Catholic areas might find themselves defenceless and that if the U.V.F. were to take over, then the role of the British Army would become very serious to ensure

Government. 
Dr. Hillery said that he had been sent by his Cabinet to see the British He thought the current policies would lead to war in Ireland, not 
only the North. He said that the IRA had been re-created as a reaction to the 
British Government’s policies of preserving the dominance of the Orange Order. He claimed that the Orange Order still ran the Northern Ireland Government and referred to Mr. Faulkner as having gone to a secret meeting of the Orange Lodge for instructions before visiting London. 
He said that following these 
policies would destroy relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic and claimed that the urgency of the situation was not appreciated by the United Kingdom Government. The Home Secretary said that the policy of the United Kingdom Government 
was to support the lawfully and democratically elected Government in Northern Ireland.

terrorism on an intolerable scale. 
Internment had been introduced because the Government was faced with It was in the common interest of both 
countries to combat the activities of gunmen and it was hoped that the Government of the Republic would be able to help achieve that objective. 
He pointed out that the Northern Ireland Government had introduced

Westminster. He suggested that the policy of the army 
The Home Secretary said thatthe army was under the control of He knew that the orders given to the soldiers provided for them 
to act impartially and he was satisfied that they did not shoot without reason. Dr. Hillery said that the army had originally gone into Northern Ireland to protect the Catholics but its role had changed and the Catholics now saw the army as having taken the place of the ’B’ Specials. 
He said that the raid on 
the Falls Road, which had been peaceful for a year after the army had moved in, was a critical mistake. 
The Home Secretary said that it was not that the 
role of the army had changed but that circumstances had changed in that the army found itself attacked by terrorists from Catholic areas. did not know or care about the affiliations of someone sniping at him. 
He 
emphasised that the bombing, the murder and the withdrawal of the Opposition from Stormont had all taken place before internment had been introduced. The Home Secretary suggested that the IRA had deliberately intensified operations to frustrate progress which was being made earlier this year. 
The soldier While 
posing as protectors of the Catholic community they were bringing it death and destruction. Dr. Hillery suggested that those interned were mostly talkers rather than 
terrorists. He complained that only Catholics had been interned and argued that Protestant snipers who had killed in the past couple of nights had not been dealt with. 
He referred to the number of licensed guns in Protestant hands 
and alleged that the police and army have stated that they will not go to certain areas where Catholics might need to be protected. 
The Home Secretary 
replied that all those arrested under the internment operation were people who the security forces believed to be active in terrorism. 
Some might also 
be engaged in more reputable political activity but this was not a reason for their internment. 
the people arrested would be those suspected of IRA activities few of whm As the terrorism was conducted by the IRA it followed that

Dr. Hillery intervened to refer to 2,200 refugees in camps in The Home Secretary replied that if it were not for the IRA 
campaign these people would still be in their own homes. It should be clearly 
understood that they were the victims of the IRA. The Home Secretary said that he must ask Dr. Hillery to do all he could to 
help in the campaign against the IRA who train, organise and find refuge south of the border. 
Dr. Hillery said that this could not be proved. The Home 
Secretary referred to two incidents in one of which a member of the UDR had been shot dead from across the border and stated that Brady and Goulding gloried in their activities from the sanctity of the Republic. 
It would be politically impossible for the Irish Dr. Hillery

the political difficulties facing his Government, Dr. Hillery said that for two years Mr. Lynch"had been seen to drift along on a half hope all of his own creation". The Home Secretary said that he had been told by many eminent Catholics 
that the reform programme now being carried out removed genuine grievances. The Home Secretary said that he was intent on sustaining the Parliament 
of Northern Ireland, not as an instrument of Unionist domination but as a democratically elected assembly through which the opportunities of participation for the minority, as suggested by Mr. Faulkner, might be possible. 
This 
position was one of justice and reality, bearing in mind that the Catholic community in Northern Ireland was a minority. regarded Stormont as finished.

Northern Ireland. The reform programme which was being carried through and to which the Stormont Government and the Westminster Government were committed, together with increased opportunities for participation for all members of the community on the lines suggested in Mr Faulkner’s initiative, showed the way forward. Progress was not, however, possible while violence reigned. It was the duty of both Governments to deal with gunmen. The United Kingdom was determined that violence should be dealt with impartially from whatever quarter it might come. Because the violence had reached a level threatening the life of the community, the United Kingdom Government had been reluctantly convinced that internment was necessary. For its part, the United Kingdom Government, would not allow this necessary measure to interfere with the objective of creating in Northern Ireland a society acceptable to both communities, lie asked the Government of the Republic to do everything it could to assist in dealing with gunmen in its own territory. It was agreed that no statement would be issued following the 
meeting. Dr Hillery would report to the Taoiseach and the Home Secretary to the Prime Minister, and the Taoiseach and Prime Minister would then be in touch through the diplomatic channel.

THE HOME SECRETARY ACCOMPANIED BY MINISTER OF STATE AT THE 
FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE RECEIVED DR. HILLERY THIS MORNING AND DISCUSSED THE SITUATION. A FULL RECORD WILL FOLLOW BUT THE FOLLOWING WERE THE MAIN POINTS. 
2. (A) DR. HILLERY SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT BY HIS GOVERNMENT 
TO EXPLAIN THEIR VIEWS. THEY SAW THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT AS A DELIBERATE CHOICE OF THE USE OF FORCE RATHER THAN POLITICAL MEANS, TO CONTROL THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THIS WOULD PRODUCE NO SOLUTION, WOULD BUILD UP THE IRA, AND WOULD HAVE VERY SERIOUS RESULTS THROUGH EXACERBATING SECTARIAN STRIFE, ENDANGERING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC AND THE U.K. AND, HE HINTED, PUTTING THE FUTURE OF MR. LYNCH’S GOVERNMENT AT RISK. THE HOME SECRETARY EXPLAINED THE BACKGROUND TO THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT AS MADE NECESSARY BY THE RECENT INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AT A TIME WHEN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT HAD BEEN MOVING FORWARD: HE EMPHASISED THAT THE MEASURE WAS NON-DISCRIMINATORY AND AIMED ONLY AT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLENCE, AND THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO RESTORE A MORE PEACEFUL SITUATION IN WHICH REFORMS COULD CONTINUE. DR. HILLERY REPLIED THAT OUR ACTION WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD IN THIS WAY. EVEN HE HIMSELF SAW IT AS A WEAPON TO CONSOLIDATE THE RULE OF THE UNIONISTS (WHICH IN DISCUSSION HE FREQUENTLY EQUATED WITH THE ORANGE ORDER), AND ASSERTED THAT THOSE INTERNED WERE SIMPLY THE TALKERS IN THE MINORITY AND NOT THE GUNMEN: NO ACTION WAS BEING TAKEN AGAINST THE UNIONIST SNIPERS WHOSE IDENTITY WAS KNOWN AND WHO WERE AT LARGE AND ACTIVE. 
HE THOUGHT THAT HMG SHOULD DO MORE TO EXPLAIN THEIR POLICY AND SEE THAT IT WAS BETTER UNDERSTOOD.

(B) DR. HILLERY THEN REVERTED TO THE NEED FOR A POLITICAL WAY FORWARD. GIVEN THE ABNORMAL SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND, HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE FOUND THROUGH BACKING THE PERMANENT UNIONIST MAJORITY IN STORMONT. HE CONSIDERED THAT MR FAULKNER’S OFFER OF PARTICIPATION HAD COME TOO LATE, HE DID NOT KNOW WHY THE OPPOSITION M.P.S HAD REFUSED, BUT HE FELT SURE THAT IT WAS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM SIMPLY TO RETURN TO STORMONT AND TAKE UP THE OFFER. SOME NEW INITIATIVE WAS REQUIRED. DR. HILLERY ADMITTED THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE POLITICALLY IMMATURE AND THAT THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF DISCIPLINE IN THE MINORITY’S REPRESENTATION. COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES WAS NEEDED BUT THIS COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT STRONG MINORITY LEADERS WHO COULD ’’DELIVER’’ THEIR FOLLOWERS IN MAKING AGREEMENTS. THEY WOULD NOT BE PRODUCED THROUGH THE PRESENT SITUATION AT STORMONT. ONLY H.M.G. COULD SECURE WHAT WAS REQUIRED, THROUGH SOME INITIATIVE OF THEIR OWN. TIME WAS SHORT AND IF NOTHING WAS DONE SOON, IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT THE MINORITY’S SPOKESMEN WERE THE IRA THEMSELVES. 
(C) THE HOME SECRETARY AGREED ON THE DESIRABILITY OF A STRONG AND RESPONSIBLE MINORITY REPRESENTATION AND EXPLAINED HIS HOPE THAT IN TIME POLITICAL PARTIES COULD GET AWAY FROM SECTARIAN TO A POLITICAL BASIS. HE WAS READY TO CONSIDER ALL WAYS FORWARD TO SECURE POLITICAL PROGRESS BUT COULD NOT DISCUSS WITH DR. HILLERY METHODS WHICH WOULD INVOLVE ANY CHANGE IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
(D) THE HOME SECRETARY PRESSED DR. HILLERY ON THE NEED FOR ACTION AGAINST THE IRA IN THE SOUTH. DR. HILLERY SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT’S POSITION WAS THAT INTERNMENT COULD NOT BE EXCLUDED IN THE FUTURE, BUT THAT IT WAS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTEMPLATE INTRODUCING IT IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS HELPING TO CONSOLIDATE UNIONIST CONTROL IN THE NORTH. WHEN TAXED WITH INCIDENTS OF IRA SHOOTING ACROSS THE BORDER HE SAID RATHER VAGUELY THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH OF THESE REPORTS. 
3. IT WAS AGREED THAT DR. HILLERY WOULD REPORT TO THE TAOISEACH 
AND THE HOME SECRETARY TO THE PRIME MINISTER. DR. HILLERY SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE TAOISEACH WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY.WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT BUT THE HOME SECRETARY SUGGESTED THAT THE OUGHT NOT TO DO SO BEFORE THE TWO GOVERNMENTS WERE AGAIN IN TOUCH AND THAT THE TAOISEACH MIGHT WISH TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER. IT /WAS

WAS AGREED THAT MEANWHILE NO PUBLIC STATEMENT WOULD BE MADE BY EITHER SIDE OTHER THAN THAT THERE HAD BEEN A FULL AND FRANK DISCUSSION AND THAT MINISTERS ON BOTH SIDES WOULD BE REPORTING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PRIME MINISTERS. 
4. THE GENERAL IMPRESSION LEFT BY THE MEETING WAS THE DR. HILLERY DESPAIRED OF A SATISFACTORY RESULT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH, AND THAT HE AND MR. LYNCH WERE REALLY ALARMED AT THE PROSPECT OF A DETERIORATION IN THE SOUTH ALSO, AND SAW THE PRESENT IRISH GOVERNMENT IN SERIOUS DANGER OF CRUMBLING BEFORE MORE MILITANT POLITICAL FORCES. DR. HILLERY MENTIONED BUT DID NOT PRESS THE QUESTION OF THE ULTIMATE UNION OF IRELAND. HE DID NOT SUGGEST A CONFERENCE OF THE THREE GOVERNMENTS OR AN ALL-IRELAND BODY: NOR DID HE SUGGEST THAT THE DATE OF MR. LYNCH’S VISIT TO LONDON SHOULD BE ADVANCED.

The Press - particularly Leader Writers - have on the 
whole accepted the inevitability of the use of special powers in Northern Ireland and their attitude has been constructive. As the disturbances have continued since Monday morning, there has been a slight decline of confidence

mistaken assumption at the out set that the use of internment would remove all terrorists and intimidation. 
position has been clear enough. It was accepted at the 
beginning that you had no alternative but to embark on Saturday and that all decisions had been taken before your departure. As the disturbances continue, however, there has been a growing feeling that you should be in London, culminating in a major Daily Mail "Comment" today "Urgent: A Helicopter for Mr. Heath", which demands a tripartite television broadcast by yourself, Lynch and Faulkner following a meeting in London. 
The theme is "H.M.G. has firmly and rightly supported Mr. Faulkner ... but he cannot restore confidence on 
his own". You have in any case decided to return to London at once 
and the Press has been told this. This will hold the 
situation well enough, but you may be accosted by the Press in Plymouth - Who will not be politically sophisticated and who should therefore be approached with care. 
Above all, we 
have not attempted to destroy the impression that you have been kept in touch throughout with situation reports. I suggest therefore the following line:-

a long-term solution is needed - of course it is; but we are facing a short-term situation. 
Only when the dust has 
settled will it be possible to plan in a wider context. (6) Mr. Lynch’s initial reaction confirmed the impression he has always given that he is a man who deplores violence. Dr. Hillery has had discussions with Mr. Maudling this morning and will be reporting back to Mr. Lynch this evening (we understand). 
You will be seeing the Home Secretary or 
talking with him as soon as you return to London (and may have a word with him on the telephone from Plymouth?). You already know (I attach a note about this) the gist of what took place this morning. (7) Mr. Lynch’s original statement challenged internment as an instrument of policy and suggested it showed a bankruptcy of political ideas in Northern Ireland. 
H.M.G. supported 
the Northern Ireland Government in the view that murders and terrorists and intimidators could not be allowed to continue unchecked; although there was no doubt that the security forces could have contained the situation, it would have involved a very long haul and a deteriorating local situation. (I attach a note of the Lobby Briefing given by the Home Secretary on Monday morning). (8) There has been no great demand for a recall of Parliament and the Government sees no reason for this at this time. Any representations made - particularly of the Opposition 
from the Leader - would of course be 
seriously considered. (9) Mr. Lynch has not publicly proposed a three-part summit. He has called for discussions "among all interested parties to obtain a new form of administration for Northern Ireland". You are not able at this stage to make any further comment on the discussions with Dr. Hillery this morning. I would however emphasise the desirability of implying 
that you have been kept in touch; although you can reitterate that all necessary decisions were taken before your departure and that there has as yet been no unforeseen development requiring a decision on your part. 
Obviously you will now To those who suggest that

be considering the latest development - the views of the Eire Government as expressed by Dr. Hillery. 
Of course you 
deplore all that has happened over the weekend and since in acts of terrorism and senseless killing of innocent persons. Your hope is that by removing the terrorist elements from the active political scene, it will be possible for the communities of Northern Ireland to get a sense of nerspective and balance.

1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF MESSAGE ISSUED AT 1800 HOURS TODAY ON BEHALF OF MR LYNCH. QUOTE THE GOVERNMENT TODAY REVIEWED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE NORTH AND ASSESSED THE PROBABLE COURSE Or FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF OBVIOUSLY ONE-SIDED INTERNMENT IN THE NORTH IS A LAST DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO SUSTAIN THE STORMONT REGIME. THIS DECISION IS ALREADY SEEN TO HAVE BEEN FUTILE AND, EVEN WORSE, IT HAS BEEN A TRAGIC MISTAKE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE NOW MUST BE TO BRING TO AN END THE APPALLING CARNAGE AND VIOLENCE IN THE NORTH WHICH IS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO LONDON OF THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THIS IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE BOTH TO THE PEOPLE OF THE 26 COUNTIES AND THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH. UNQUOTE.

TO FLASH F C 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 3 5 OF 9 AUGUST, INFO IMMEDIATE TO UKREP BELFAST, 
INTERNMENT FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF STATEMENT ISSUED ON BEHALF OF THE TAOISEACH 
THIS MORNING, 9 AUGUST. BEGINS THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL IN THE NORTH THIS MORNING IS DEPLORABLE EVIDENCE OF THE POLITICAL POVERTY OF THE POLICIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PURSUED THERE FOR SOME TIME AND WHICH I CONDEMNED PUBLICLY LAST WEEK. EVEN IF IT SUCCEEDS IN DAMPING DOWN THE CURRENT WAVE OF VIOLENCE 
IT DOES NOTHING TO FORWARD THE NECESSARY LONG TERM SOLUTIONS, THE SYMPATHIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 
IRISH PEOPLE NORTH ANS SOUTH GO TO THE NATIONALIST MINORITY IN THE NORTH WHO ARE AGAIN VICTIMISED BY AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN A REGIME WHICH HAS LONG SINCE SHOWN ITSELF INCAPABLE OF JUST GOVERNMENT AND CONTEMPTUOUS OF THE NORMS OF THE BRITISH DEMOCRACY TO WHICH THEY PRETEND ALLEGIANCE. HARDSHIP WILL BE SUFFERED BY MANY FAMILIES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTERNMENT AND I HAVE INSTRUCTED ARMY AUTHORITIES TO MAKE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE AT ARMY CAMPS TO ANY DEPENDANTS OF INTERNEES WHO SEEK SUCH ACCOMMODATION. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE NORTH IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT 
FURTHER PARADES BE NOW BANNED THERE AND THAT THE LAW BE ADMINISTERED IMPARTIALLY AND THAT A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE INTERESTED PARTIES TAKE PLACE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A NEW FORM OF ADMINISTRATION FOR

9 AUGUST 
1. MR FAULKNER, THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND, ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING, 9 AUGUST, THAT AFTER WEIGHING ALL THE RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING THE VIEWS OF THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND COVERNENT HAD DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT. THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORISM, AT THE SAME TIME A BAN ON ALL MARCHES AND PARADES WAS ANNOUNCED: THIS BAN, WHICH IS INITIALLY FOR-SIX MONTHS, COVERS A MAJOR PROTESTANT EVENT WHICH HAD BEEN DUE THIS WEEK, THE APPRENTICE BOYS’ MARCH IN LONDONDERRY. 
2. THIS DECISION HAS BEEN MADE IN THE LIGHT OF IRA ACTIVITY WHICH HAS INCREASED BOTH IN VOLUME AND IN THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE ATTACKS ON THE SECURITY FORCES AND SOCIETY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. IN ADDITION TO THOSE KILLED BY GUNMEN, EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST POLICE STATIONS, AND ALSO BARS, AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CASUALTIES AMONGST ORDINARY CITIZENS WERE INEVITABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE WEIGHT AND QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES BEING USED, AND A CROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL PREMISES IN BELFAST. THESE HAVE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL-PLANNED OPERATIONS BY GANGS OF UP TO A DOZEN MEN, WHICH SHOWS THE GROWING CONFIDENCE -WITH WHICH THE IRA IS NOW OPERATING. ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES A DELIBERATE IRA POLICY TO DISTURB SOCIETY IN THE NORTH, DESTROY ECONOMIC LIFE AND DISCREDIT THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT, 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
3. ALL IMMEDIATE ADDRESSEES SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE FOREGOING IS AS APPROPRIATE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCREDITED, AND THE REASONS BEHIND THE DECISION APPRECIATED. OTHER POSTS HAVE DISCRETION TO DO LIKEWISE. ALL SHOULD IN ADDITION ENSURE THAT.PRESS AND TV ARE FULLY BRIEFED.

4. YOU MAY AS APPROPRIATE DRAW UPON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: A. INTERNMENT IS AIMED ONLY AGAINST INDIVIDUALS 
CONDUCTING 
VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM, AND NOT AGAINST A RELIGIOUS MINORITY. THE MEASURES TAKEN WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
B. THE SECTARIAN RIOTING OF 1969 IS NOW LONG PAST. WHAT WE NOW FACE IS ARMED ATTACKS BY THE IRA. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
C. THE SECURITY FORCES DEAL WITH ANY LAW-BREAKING BY EXTREMIST PROTESTANTS AS FIRMLY AS THEY DEAL WITH SIMILAR TROUBLE COMING FROM ROMAN CATHOLIC ELEMENTS. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
D. VIOLENCE HAS THROUGHOUT BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
E. MR LYNCH, THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC, HAS ALSO BEEN FORTHRIGHT IN HIS CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE, MOST RECENTLY IN A.SPEECH OF 8 AUGUST. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
F. THE IRA’S TWO FACTIONS, BRADYITES AND GOULDINGITES, BOTH PROFESS A REVOLUTIONARY CREED, AND THE LATTER’S PROGRAMME IS AVOWEDLY MARXIST. ALTHOUGH UNTIL RECENTLY THE BRADYITES HAVE TENDED TO BE THE MORE VIOLENT, THE GOULDINGITES HAVE IN RECENT WEEKS BEEN ACTIVE IN CAUSING VIOLENCE IN THE NORTH AND ALSO ATTACKS ON FOREIGN PROPERTY IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC ITSELF. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
G. IRA VIOLENCE HAS MADE RECOURSE TO INTERNMENT NECESSARY ON EARLIER OCCASIONS. THE NORTHERN. IRELAND GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED INTERNMENT DURING THE LAST WAR AND IN 1957-61. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
H. THOSE HELD WILL, WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD, EITHER BE CHARGED BEFORE A COURT, RELEASED, OR MADE THE SUBJECT OF AN INTERNMENT ORDER. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
I. INTERNEES CAN MAKE REPRESENTATIONS TO AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE.

J. A VERY CONSIDERABLE PROGRAMME OF REFORM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE POSITION OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MINORITY AND ENSURE JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FOR ALL HAS BEEN ENACTED IN NORTHERN IRELAND OVER 
THE PAST FEW YEARS. RECENTLY R FAULKNER, RECOGNISING THAT THE PATTERN OF VOTING IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS FIRMLY FIXED ALONG SECTARIAN LINES, WHICH CONDEMED THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT TO PERMANENT OPPOSITION, ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE SYSTEM BY WHICH THE OPPOSITION COULD HOPE TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT. TWO OF THE FOUR CHAIRMEN WERE TO COME FROM THE OPPOSITION. THESE AND OTHER REFORMS UNDER DISCUSSION WILL, IT IS HOPED, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
K. IF ASKED, YOU MAY CONFIRM THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO CONSIDER A DEROGATION UNDER ARTICLE 15 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. (UNATTRIBUTADLE) 
L. IF ASKED WHY THE NORMAL PROCESSES OF LAW DO NOT SUFFICE, YOU SHOULD POINT TO THE EVIDENCE OF INTIMIDATION, BEATINGS, TARRING AND FEATHERINGS, AND UNEXPLAINED DEATHS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED IN AREAS WHERE THE IRA IS KNOWN TO BE STRONG. (UNATTRIBUTABLE). 5. FURTHER BACKGROUND IS IN GUIDANCE NO 158 AND IN HONIPS. 
6. FULL TEXT OF MR FAULKNER’S STATEMENT WILL FOLLOW IN THE VERBATIM SERVICE.

TO IMMEDIATE F.C 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 311 OF 10 AUGUST, INFO IMMEDIATE TO UKREP BELFAST. 1. MY TELS NOS 307 AND 308 REFELECT THE CENTRAL PUBLIC REACTIONS IN THE REPUBLIC TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE INTERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT. IRISH MINISTERS RECALLED FROM THEIR HOLIDAYS HAVE BEER MEETING THIS MORNING, AFTER WHAT, ONE HOPES, WILL PROVE TO HAVE BEEN THE WORST. NIGHT IN THE NORTH. THIS TELEGRAM IS MY ATTEMPT TO PICK OUT THE SALIENT POINTS IN A STILL VERY FLUID SITUATION AND FORECAST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAPPEN. 2. MR LYNCH’ ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE IS VERY LIMITED. IF THE DAILY WERE RECALLED AND THERE WERE A DIVISION ON HIS POLICY TOWARDS THE NORTH AS HITHERTO FORMULATED, THE HARDL-LINERS IN FIANNA FAIL WOULD PROBABLY DEFECT AND HE WOULD BE DEFEATED. IF BY THE END OF OCTOBER INTERNMENT IS STILL IN FORCE WITH NO VISIBLE CHANGE IN THE LOT OF THE CATHOLICS, HE WILL BE HARD PUT TO IT TO SURVIVE. 3. HE HAS NOT BUDGED AN INCH FROM HIS PREVIOUSLY STATED VIEWS ON THE USE OF FORCE AND THE NECESSITY FOR PEACEFUL CHANGE IN THE NORTH. BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT, AGAINST HIS ADVICE AND WITH THE APPARENT SHORT-TERM CONSEQUENCE OF UNITING ALL THE IRISH CATHOLICS NORTH AND SOUTH AGAINST US, FORCES HIM INTO A VERY TIGHT CORNER. IN THIS SITUATION IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT IN PUBLIC HE HAS NOT EXCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERNMENT BECOMING NECESSARY IN THE SOUTH. 4. PRIVATELY, HE WOULD PROBABLY BE GLAD TO BE PROVED WRONG AND, WITH THE I R A LEADERS OUT OF THE WAY, SEE THE CATHOLIC MINORITY SETTLING DOWN TO A PEACEFUL LIFE IN THE NORTHERN COMMUNITY. 5. UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER NOBODY THAT I HAVE MET CAN SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY SHOULD, OR WHY THEY SHOULD PUT ANY FAITH IN MR FAULKNER’S WORD TO HIS ’’ CATHOLIC FELLOW COUNTRYMEN’’ IN HIS STATEMENT ON INTERNMENT. AND THE FACT OF INTERNMENT, TAKEN BY ITSELF, DOES NOTHING TO REMOVE THEIR SCEPTICISM. THE ATTITUDE OF THOUGHTFUL AND WELL DISPOSED IRISHMEN IS THAT INTERNMENT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACT DESIGNED TO HELP EXECUTE A POLICY: AND THAT POLICY IS

DICTATED BY EXTREME PROTESTANTS AND CONSITS OF IMPOSING THE STATUS QUO ON THE CATHOLICS, IT IS A SECTARIAN ACT WHICH WILL RALLY ALL CATHOLICS NORTH AND SOUTH BEHIND THE INTERNEES AND AGAINST US. HENCE MR LYNCH IS OBLIGED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO OPEN UP REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE SOUTH AND CALL FOR A CONFERENCE OF ALL INTERESTED PARTIES ON THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH. 6. I CANNOT OF COURSE COMMENT ON THE EFFECT IN THE NORTH, BUT I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE A STEADYING EFFECT IN THE SOUTH IF, IN ADDITION TO THE DETAILS SUGGESTED IN MY TEL NO 302, H.M.G. COULD TAKE UP MR FAULKNER’S APPEAL TO THE CATHOLICS (FINAL PARAGRAPH OF HIS STATEMENT OF 9 AUGUST) BY STATING VERY CLEARLY THAT INTERNMENT IS ONLY A MEANS TO AN END AND THAT THIS END IS THE RAPID CREATION OF A SOCIETY FROM WHICH DISCRIMINATION AND INJUSTICE HAD BEEN ELIMINATED. IF H.M.G. CAN COMMIT THEMSELVES PUBLICLY TO A GUARANTEE THAT MR FAULKNER’S FINE WORDS WILL BE RAPIDLY TRANSLATED INTO SPECIFIC AND PRACTICAL AS DISTINCT FROM PAPER REFORMS, INTERNMENT WILL BE SEEN HERE TO HAVE AN EXPLICIT POSITIVE PURPOSE AS WELL AS THE NEGATIVE ONE OF ENDING TERRORISM, 7. I HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM THE D F A THAT DR HILLERY IS SEEING THE HOME SECRETARY AND MR GODBER TOMORROW. MINISTERS HAVE BEEN MEETING ALL MORNING 
, ARE NOW SEEING S.D.L.P. REPRESENTATIVES 
AND WILL THEN RESUME. I AM ASSURED THAT THEIR PRESENT AIM IS TO DO ALL IN THEIR POWER TO DEFUZE THE SITUATION.

1. BY THE TIME I SAW THE TAOISEACH STORMONT HAD ALREADY ANNOUNCED INTERNMENT, AND HE HAD ALREADY HALF DRAFTED A STATEMENT CALLING FOR 
A BAN ON PARADES. I TOOK HIM THROUGH THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE, FOR WHICH HE WAS GRATEFUL, AND I AM SURE HE WILL DO WHAT HE CAN WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLITICALLY POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE DOWN. 2. HE IS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE, AND STILL MORE THE TEXT, SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET. YOUR TELEGRAM NO 155 MIGHT BE TAKEN TO SUGGEST THAT ITS HIGH SECURITY GRADING ONLY APPLIED UNTIL 11.15 A..M. BUT SINCE THE REFERENCE TO OUR NON- EXISTENT MEETING LAST WEEK WOULD CLEARLY BE DISASTROUS, I TOOK IT ON MY SELF TO GRADE THE MESSAGE SECRET AND PERSONAL. 3. HE WAS NATURALLY A LITTLE UPSET BY PARAGRAPH 7 AND HE FOUND ITS LAST SENTENCE A BIT ILLOGICAL. HE IS OF COURSE PLEASED BY PARAS 2 AND 3 OF THE MESSAGE, AND ATTACHES PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO PARA 8. 4. PLEASE SEE M.I.F.T.

LYNCH IS VERY NERVOUS OF ANY SUGGESTION OF PRIOR CONSULTATION OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE. AS STORMONT APPEAR TO HAVE JUMPED THE GUN IN ANNOUNCING INTERNMENT, MR LYNCH IS PROBABLY ISSUING IMMEDIATE STATEMENT CALLING FOR BAN ON MARCHES. 2. PLEASE SEE M.I.F.T.

HM EMBASSY 
(II) BRITISH OFFICES - BOAC ETC (I1) EMBASSY STAFF, FAMILIES AND HOMES (IV) BRITISH INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS (V) BRITISH AND ANGLO-IRISH RESIDENTS. 
2. IT WOULD BE UNDESIRABLE TO MAKE ANY APPEAL TO IRISH AUTHORITIES. 
FOR HELP, AND IN ANY CASE THE POTENTIAL TARGETS ARE FAR BEYOND THE RESOURCES OF THE IRISH TO PROTECT. ATTACKS ON THESE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE REGARDED BY THEMSELVES AS GROUNDS FOR INTRODUCING INTERNMENT. 
WE ARE ALREADY TAKING WHAT PRECAUTIONS 
WE CAN FOR SAFEGUARDING EMBASSY AND STAFF AND CAN ONLY ENSURE THAT EXISTING RULES ARE CLOSELY OBSERVED BY ALL CONCERNED.

1. I HAVE OT YET (3.00PM SUNDAY) HAD ANY RESPONSE FROM MR LYNCH, BUT WE MUST WORK ON THE ASSUMPTIO THAT SOMEHOW AND SOMEWHERE I WILL DELIVER THE PRIME MINISTERS MESSAGE TOMORROW MORNING. I HAVE THREE COMMENTS. 
(I) 
PRESENTATION. IN THE OUTCRY THAT WILL FOLLOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT MR LYNCH 
IS GOING TO BE HEAVILY PRESSED TO SAY WHETHER HE WAS CONSULTED BEFORE THE DECISION WAS TAKEN, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY NO. (MY TELNO 290). 
(11) TIMING. HE WILL BE PRESSED TO SAY WHETHER HE KNEW IN ADVANCE AND IF SO 
WHEN. IT SEEMS IMPORTANT THAT ALL CONCERNED SHOULD STICK TO AN AGREED LINE. 
I SUGGEST THAT THIS SHOULD BE QUOTE YES, HM 
AMBASSADOR CONVEYED A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE MORNING OF 9 AUGUST INFORMING HIM OF THE DECISION UNQUOTE. 
(11) I AM NOT CLEAR WHY THE DEADLINE IS 9.30 AM RATHER THAN SAY 10.00 AM. 
IN THEORY EARLIER TIME COULD JUST MAKE IT POSSIBLE 
FOR MR LYNCH TO MAKE A LAST-MINUTE APPEAL FOR RECONSIDERATION. BALANCING THIS CONSIDERATION AGAINST COURTESY I WOULD BE SLIGHTLY IN FAVOUR OF THE LATER TIME, ALTHOUGH IT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE DECIDED BY THE GEOGRAPHY AND MECHANICS OF WHERE HE SEES ME.

8 AUGUST 
I AM SENDING YOU THIS MESSAGE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL VERY SHORTLY BE ANNOUNCING THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF THE LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS,, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT. THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY ARRESTING AND DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMITTING OR ABETTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AND OTHER BREACHES OF THE PEACE DESIGNED TO LEAD TO A BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER iN NORTHERN IRELAND. 2. HE WILL AT THE SAME TIME ANNOUNCE THAT ALL MARCHES AND PARADES ARE BANNED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. THE BAN WILL BE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR SIX MONTHS, BUT IT WILL BE MADE CLEAR THAT THE NEED TO EXTEND AND RENEW THE BAN FOR A FURTHER PERIOD WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD. 3. THERE WILL BE A SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ALL OUTSTANDING APPLICATIONS TO START RIFLE CLUBS ARE BEING REFUSED, AND THAT NO NEW APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED, 4. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE NOTICE OF A DECISION TO INTRODUCE INTERNMENT BEFORE THE OPERATION TO GIVE EFFECT TO IT. THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE IN FACT BEEN CARRYING OUT SUCH AN OPERATION THIS MORNING. 5. WHEN FAULKNER CAME TO LONDON LAST WEEK, HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOW THE RIGHT AID INDEED INEVITABLE COURSE. THE LATEST SERIES OF ACTS OF TERRORISM

BY THE IRA AND THEIR RECENT DECLARATIONS OF THEIR INTENTION TO CONTINUE AND EVEN ESCALATE THAT CAMPAIGN HAVE MADE IT ESSENTIAL TO TAKE THIS ACTION HOWEVER ABHORRENT, IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE UNDERMINING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. IN PURELY MILITARY TERMS, SEEKING TO CONTAIN THIS DETERIORATING SITUATION BY THE MEANS EMPLOYED HITHERTO WOULD HAVE MEANT AT BESTA LONG HAUL. FAULKNER’S JUDGEMENT WAS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT IS NOW PROPOSED. 6. THAT IS HIS JUDGEMENT OF THE SITUATION 
, AND OF COURSE 
THE DECISION IS HIS, THOUGH HE HAS REACHED IT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH US. FOR OUR PART, WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF OUR ACCEPTING INTERNMENT, AND INSTRUCTING OUR FORCES TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT IT, IF IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE BAN ON MARCHES AND PARADES OF ALL KINDS: AND WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR PRESENT VIEW THAT THAT BAN WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN FORCE FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS, THOUGH THE EXTENSION BEYOND SIX MONTHS REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. 7. WE REALISE THAT THESE DECISIONS CARRY THEIR DANGERS AS WELL AS THEIR ADVANTAGES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND: AND I AM WELL AWARE OF THEIR IMPLICATIONS AND DANGERS FOR YOU. CLEARLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND COULD HAVE BEEN INCREASED IF YOU HAD FELT ABLE TO TAKE SIMILAR MEASURES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE BORDER. BUT I JUDGED FROM OUR AMBASSADOR’S REPORT OF HIS RECENT TALK WITH YOU THAT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF THAT, AND I COULD NOT THEREFORE HOLD OUT THIS POSSIBILITY AS AN INDUCEMENT TO FAULKNER TO HOLD H IS HAND. 8. WE HAVE HOWEVER MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT THE MEASURES TAKEN SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE. THE MARCHES DUE IN DERRY ON 12 AUGUST AND IN BELFAST AT THE END OF THE MONTH WILL NOT NOW TAKE PLACE. AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL BE SET UP, TO WHICH ANY ONE WHO IS INTERNED WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS 9. I REGRET NO LESS THAN YOU THAT THESE NEW MEASURES HAVE BEEN FOUND NECESSARY. 
I HOPE THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID, 
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REACT TO THEM WITH UNDERSTANDING, EVEN IF WITH REGRET. THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL CALL FOR VIOLENT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THESE MEASURES: A REMINDER FROM YOU THAT VIOLENCE SERVES NO PURPOSE, AND THAT INTERNMENT IS AIMED AGAINST PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AVOWEDLY WORKING FOR A BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND /ORDER,

ORDER, WOULD BE INVALUABLE. I ALSO HOPE THAT, HOWEVER YOU MAY FEEL OBLIGED TO REACT IN PUBLIC, YOU WILL IN PRACTICE BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE OF HARASSMENT ON THE I.R.A. SOUTH OF THE ORDER, WHICH WILL OF COURSE BE REINFORCED FROM THE NORTH. 10. OUR HOPE IS THAT THESE MEASURES CAN BE STRICTLY TEMPORARY, WILL SERVE TO RE-ESTABLISH A SITUATION IN WHICH THE MANY SOCIAL AND OTHER REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND ARE STILL TO COME ARE RECOGNISED AT THEIR TRUE VALUE, AND WILL NOT PREJUDICE CONTINUING PROGRESS ON THE TASK OF BUILDING MORE HARMONIOUS INTER-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 11. AND ABOVE ALL I HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP WHICH YOU AND I HAVE ESTABLISED, AND THE CLOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES ON SO MANY MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO US BOTH: AND PARTICULARLY ON ENTRY INTO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES. 12. I AM MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR VISIT IN OCTOBER, WHICH WILL GIVE US AM OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE RANGE OF MATTERS OF INTEREST TO US BOTH.

TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELEGRAM NUMBER 155 OF 8 AUGUST. PERSONAL FOR AMBASSADOR. MIFT CONTAINS A MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE TAOISEACH AND IS FOR DELIVERY TO MR LYNCH PERSONALLY. IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HIM ON THE MORNING OF MONDAY 9 AUGUST NOT EARLIER THAN 0900 AM FOR THE REASON INDICATED IN PARAGRAPH 4 OF THE MESSAGE, BUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEREAFTER. IT IS INTENDED THAT MR FAULKNER SHOULD MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN BELFAST AT 1115 A.M. THAT MORNING. YOU SHOULD DRAW PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO PARAGRAPH 9 EXPRESSING THE PRIME MINISTER’S HOPE THAT MR LYNCH’S PUBLIC RESPONSE WILL BE HELPFUL PARTICULARLY IN CONDEMNING VIOLENCE, WITH THE AIM OF HIS MAKING CLEAR TO THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH THAT THEY SHOULD NOT INTERPET THE MEASURES TAKEN AS DIRECTED AGAINST THEM BUT ONLY AT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DELIBERATELY USING VIOLENCE TO CREATE DISORDER. WHAT MR LYNCH SAYS IN PUBLIC MAY WELL SET THE TONE FOR THE RESPONSE OF THE MINORITY THEMSELVES. 2. PLEASE EMPHASISE TO MR LYNCH THE NEED TO MAINTAIN COMPLETE SECRECY ON THE WHOLE SUBJECT UNTIL THE ANNOUNCEMENT IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT HE SHOULD NOT REVEAL TO ANYONE UNTIL THEN THE DECISION ABOUT THE BAN ON MARCHES. 3. IN VIEW OF THE DANGER OF IRA REPRISALS YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY REVIEW SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR STAFF, ALSO FOR OTHER BRITISH OFFICES IN THE REPUBLIC.

THE UNDERMINING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. IN PURELY MILITARY TERMS, SEEKING TO CONTAIN THIS DETERIORATING SITUATION BY THE MEANS EMPLOYED HITHERTO WOULD HAVE MEANT AT BEST A LONG HAUL. FAULKNER’S JUDGEMENT 
WAS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT IS NOW PROPOSED. THERE IS ALSO THE FACT THAT THE INTIMIDATION OF THE POPULATION BY THE TERRORISTS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY HAMPERING THE PROCESS OF GATHERING. INTELLIGENCE, AND HAS IMPEDED THE COURSE OF JUSTICE. 6. THE DECISION IS, OF COURSE, FAULKNER’S , SINCE THE POWERS UNDER WHICH THESE MEASURES ARE TAKEN ARE POWERS OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT. BUT IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDS UPON THE CO-OPERATION OF THE UNITS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND HE HAS DECIDED AS HE ALWAYS SAID HE WOULD, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH US. FOR OUR PART, WE ARE OF COURSE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FORCES ARE COMMITTED IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THE IMPLICATION OF THAT FOR OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY ELSEWHERE. IF THIS MOVE ENABLE US TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS COMMITTED TO NORTHERN IRELAND EARLIER THAN WE COULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE, THAT WILL BE A WELCOME CONSEQUENCE OF IT. BUT WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO FAULKNER THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF OUR ACCEPTING INTERNMENT, AND INSTRUCTING OUR FORCES TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT IT, IF IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE BAN ON MARCHES AND PARADES OF ALL KINDS: AND WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR PRESENT VIEW THAT THE BAN WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN FORCE FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS, ALTHOUGH THE EXTENSION AFTER SIX MONTHS REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. 7. WE REALISE, OF COURSE, THAT THESE DECISIONS CARRY THEIR DANGERS AS WELL AS THEIR ADVANTAGES IN NORTHERN IRELAND: AND I AM ALSO VERY WELL AWARE OF THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE IRISH REPUBLIC. WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT THE MEASURES TAKEN SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE. THE MARCHES DUE IN DERRY ON 12 AUGUST AND IN BELFAST AT THE END OF THE MONTH WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WILL BE SET UP, TO WHICH ANY ONE WHO IS INTERNED WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS.

8. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNMENT NORTH OF THE BORDER WOULD BE GREATER IF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO INTRODUCE INTERNMENT SOUTH OF THE BORDER AT THE SAME TIME: BUT ALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT’S POLICIES SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF PARALLEL ACTION SOUTH OF THE BORDER. I HAVE HOWEVER SENT A MESSAGE TO LYNCH, ASKING HIM TO REACT WITH UNDERSTANDING, EVEN IF WITH REGRET, AND EMPHASISING THAT WE HOPE THAT THESE MEASURES CAN BE STRICTLY TEMPORARY, AND WILL NOT PREJUDICE CONTINUING PROGRESS IN THE TASK OF MAKING PROGRESS WITH BUILDING MORE HARMONIOUS INTERCOMMUNITY RELATIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. I HAD ALREADY INVITED MR LYNCH TO COME OVER HERE FOR MEETINGS IN OCTOBER, FOR A GENERAL DISCUSSION ON THE WHOLE RANGE OF MATTERS OF INTEREST TO US BOTH, AND I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT THE ARRANGEMENT WILL BE ABLE TO STAND.

the decision is his, though he has reached it after consultation with us. 
For our part, we made it clear that 
there could be no question of our accepting internment, and instructing our forces to help to implement it, if it was not accompanied by a complete ban on marches and parades of all kinds; and we have made clear our present view that that ban will need to remain in force for longer than six months, though the extension beyond six months remains formally open for discussion. 7. 
We realise that these decisions carry their dangers as

MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL VERY SHORTLY BE ANNOUNCING THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF THE LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT. THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY ARRESTING AND DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMITTING OR ABETTING ACTSOF TERRORISM AND OTHER BREACHES OF THE PEACE DESIGNED TO LEAD TO A BREAKDOWN OF LAW ANDORDER IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
2. ARE BANNED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. 
HE WILL AT THE SAME TIME ANOUNCE THAT ALL MARCHES AND PARADES THE BAN WILL BE IN THE FIRST 
INSTANCE FOR SIX MONTHS, BUT IT WILL BE MADE CLEAR THA THE NEED TO EXTEND AND RENEW THE BAN FOR A FURTHER PERIOD WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
3. 4. / HE WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE THAT ALL OUTSTANDING APPLICATONS TO 
START RIFLE CLUBS ARE BEING REFUSED, AND THA NO NEW APLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED. 
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS IMPOSIBLE TO GIVE NOTICE OF A 
DECISION TOINTRODUCE INTERNMENT BEFORE THE OPERATION TO GIVE EFFECT TO IT. THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE IN FACT BEEN CARRYING OUT SUCH AN OPEATION THIS MORNING. 
5. 
COME TO THECONCLUSION THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOW THE RIGHT AND INDEED INEVITABLE COURSE. 
THE IRA AND THEIR RECENT DECLARATIONS OF THEIR INTENTION TO CONTINUE AND EVEN ESCALATE THEIR CAMPAIGN HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO RESIST THE PRESSURES ON HIM FOR MORE DRASTI ACTION TO ARREST THE DETERIORATION OF MORALE AND THE UNDERMINING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
IN PURELY 
MILITARY TERMS, SEEKING TO CONTAIN THE SITUATION BY THE MEANS EMPLOYED HITHERTO WOULD HAVE MEANT AT BEST A LONG HAUL : AND FAULKNERS JUDGEMENT WAS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT IS NOW PROPOSED. 
6. 
DECISION IS HIS, THOUGH HE HAS REACHED IT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH US. 
THAT IS HIS JUDGEMENT OF THE SITUATION, AND OF COURSE THE FOR OUR PART, WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE COULD BE NO 
QUESTION OF OUR ACCEPTING INTERNMENT, AND INSTRUCTING OUR SOURCES TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT IT, IF IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE BAN ON MARCHES AND PARADES OF ALL KINDS: AND WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR PRESENT VIEW THAT THAT BAN WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN FORCE FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS THOUGH THE EXTENTION BEYOND SIX MONTHS REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. 
7. WE REALISE THAT THESE DECISIONS CARRY THEIR DANGERS AS WELL 
AS THEIR ADVANTAGES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND: AND I AM WELL AWARE OF THEIR IMPLICATIONS AND DANGERS FOR YOU. CLEARLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND COULD HAVE BEN INCREASED IF YOU HAD FELT ABLE TO TAKE SIMILAR MEASURES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE BORDER. BUT I JUDGED FROMOUR AMBASSADORS REPORT OF HIS RECENT TALK WITH YOU THAT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF THAT, AND IC COULD NOT THEREFORE HOLD OUT THIS POSSIBILITY AS AN INDUCEMENT TO FAULKNER TO HOLD HIS HAND. 
8. WE HAVE HOWEVER MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT THE MEASURES 
TAKEN SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE. 
AT THE END OF THE MONTH WILL NOT NOW TAKE PLACE. 
COMMITTEE WILL BE SET UP TO WHICH ANYONE WHO IS INTERNED WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS. 9. 
THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL CALL FOR 
THE MARCHES DUE IN DERRY ON 12 AUGUST AND IN BELFAST AN ADVISORY 
I REGRET NO LESS THAN YOU THAT THESE NEW MEASURES HAVE BEEN 
FOUND NECESSARY. I HOPE THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID, U YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REACT TO THEM WITH UNDERSTANDING, EVEN IF WITH REGRET. 
VIOLENT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THESE MEASURES: A REMINDER FROM YOU THAT VIOLENCE SERVES NO PURPOSE, AND THAT INTERNMENT IS AIMED AGAINST PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAS WHO ARE AVOWEDLY WORKING FOR A BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER, WOULD BE INVALUABLE. I ALSO HOPE THAT, HOWEVER YOU MAY FEEL OBLIGED TO REACT IN PUBLIC, YOU WILL IN PRACTICE BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE OF HARASSMENT ON THE IRA SOUTH OF THE BORDER, WHO WILL OF COURSE BE REINFORCED FROM THE NORTH. 
10. OUR HOPE S THAT THESE MEASURES CAN BE STRICTl Y TEMPORARY, WILL SERVE TO REESTABLISH A SITUATION IN WHICH THE MANY SOCIAL. 
AND OTHER REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND ARE STILL TO COME ARE RECOGNISED AT THEIR TRUE VALUE, AND WILL NOT PREJUDICE CONTINUING PROGRESS ON THE TASK OF BUILDING MORE HARMONIOUS INTER-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
11. AND ABOVE ALL I HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP WHIH YOU AND I HAVE ESTABLISHED, AND THE CLOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES ON SO MANY MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO US BOTH: AND PARTICULARLY ON ENTRY INTO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.

DRAFT MESSAGE TO MR. NIXON I am sending you this message to let you know 
that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland will very shortly be announcing that, in the light of the latest assessment of the security situation in Northern Ireland and all other relevant factors, and after consultation with the British Government, the Northern Ireland Government has decided to activate its powers of internment. The security forces are accordingly arresting and detaining people suspected of responsibility for committing or abetting acts of terrorism and other breaches of the peace designed to lead to a breakdown of law and order in Northern Ireland. 2. 
parades are banned until further notice. 
He will at the same time announce that all marches and The ban will be 
in the first instance for six months, but it will be made clear that the need to extend and renew the ban for a further period will be considered in the light of the situation towards the end of the period. 3. [He will also announce that all outstanding applications to start rifle clubs are being refused, and that no new applications will be considered.] 4. 
You will understand why it is impossible to give 
notice of a decision to introduce internment before the operation to give effect to it. 
The security forces have 
in fact been carrying out such an operation this morning. 5. 
When Faulkner came to London last week, he told us that he had come to the conclusion that internment was now

the right and indeed inevitable course. The latest 
series of acts of terrorism by the I.R.A. and their recent declarations of their intention to continue and even escalate that campaign have made it

social stability in Northern Ireland. In purely military terms, seeking to contain 
hitherto would have meant at best a long haul. 
situation by the means employed Faulkner’s 
judgment was that the consequences of that for the community would be worse than the consequences of what is now proposed. 
There is also the fact that the intimidation 
of the population by the terrorists has been increasingly hampering the process of gathering intelligence 6. 
The decision is, of course, Faulkner’s, since the 
powers under which these measures are taken are powers of the Northern Ireland Government. 
But implementation 
depends upon the co-operation of the units of the British Army in Northern Ireland, and he has decided as he always said he would, after consultation with us. 
For our part, 
we are of course very concerned about the degree to which our Forces are committed in Northern Ireland, and the implication of that for our military capability elsewhere. If this move enables us to reduce the number of troops committed to Northern Ireland earlier than we could otherwise have done, that will be a welcome consequence of it. 
But 
we have made it clear to Faulkner that there could be no question of our accepting internment, and instructing our

forces to help to implement it, if it was not accompanied by a complete ban on marches and parades of all kinds; and we have made clear our present view that that ban will need to remain in force for longer than six months, although the extension after six months remains formally open for discussion. 7. 
We realise, of course, that these decisions carry 
their dangers as well as their advantages in Northern Ireland; and I am also very well aware of their implications for the Irish Republic. 
We have made clear our view that 
the measures taken should not discriminate as between the different sections of the community, except as the facts of the situation make inevitable. 
The marches due in Derry 
on 12 August and in Belfast at the end of the month will not take place. 
An advisory committee will be set up, to which 
any one who is interned will have the right to make representations. 8. 
The effectiveness of internment north of the border 
would be greater if the Irish Government were prepared to introduce internment south of the border at the same time; but all that we know of the Irish Government’s policies suggeststhat there is no possibility of parallel action south of the border. I have however sent a message to Lynch, asking him to react with understanding, even if with regret, 
emphasising that we hope that these measures can be strictly temporary,

and will not prejudice continuing progress in the task of making progress with building more harmonious intercommunity relations in Northern Ireland.

6th August, 1971 I enclose two copies of a record of yesterday’s evening’s discussion 
with Mr. Faulkner. I am sending copies to Graham Angel and Philip Allen; to Johnny Graham and Stewart Crawford; and to Robert Andrew and the CGS. 
I should perhaps take this opportunity to put it on record that the 
Prime Minister told me after the meeting that, in the earlier private discussion which he and his colleagues had had with Mr. Faulkner, they had made it clear to the latter that, if internment failed, there could be no question of then moving on to e. g. reviving the B Specials or anything of that sort. The next step, and the only remaining step, would be direct rule. 
R. T. Armstrong, Esq.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, after discussing with his colleagues the representations which Mr Faulkner had made at their meeting earlier in the afternoon, he had reached the conclusion that, if the position could be correctly described by saying that Mr Faulkner now wished to adopt a policy of internment and to invoke the statutory powers available to him for this purpose, the British Government would regard themselves as having been consulted by the Government of Northern Ireland and would be ready to acquiesce in this decision and to give the security forces the necessary instructions. 
This, 
however, must be on the basis that all marches would be banned indefinitely; even if the Government of Northern Ireland’s powers in this respect were of only limited duration, they would have to be periodically renewed. 
It was important that the basis on which this action was publicly justified should be that it would provide an opportunity for fresh initiatives to promote political reconciliation and to carry forward the economic development of the Province. It would also be essential that the policy should be seen to be impartial in its application; and it would presumably be desirable for this purpose that those interned should include a certain number of Protestants. In addition it would be desirable to take this opportunity to prohibit rifle clubs. 
During his own absence the Home Secretary would take general charge of the operation, so far as the British Government were concerned. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would be responsible for dealing with its international implications, which might be not inconsiderable. He himself would send the necessary messages to the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Eire at the appropriate moment. It should not be necessary to recall Parliament. 
MR FAULKNER said that an indefinite ban on marches would be impracticable. The Northern Ireland Government’s powers in this respect were of only 12 months duration; and it would in any case be unrealistic to suppose that the great march on 12th July could be banned. Moreover, if the Republican faction reacted to internment by wholesale demonstrations, it would be impossible to restrain Protestants for long from counter-demonstrations of the same kind. As regards the rifle clubs, most of their members 
- as the RUC 
would attest - were respectable and responsible citizens; and a prohibition on their activities would be liable to provoke unnecessary ill-feeling.

THE PRIME MINISTER replied that the Northern Ireland Government must clearly understand that the British Cabinet, who had considered the situation with great care, would not be prepared to acquiesce in internment unless there was a ban on marches without specific limit of time. They would not be prepared to have this card played against them again when the Northern Ireland Government next found themselves under pressure. 
Internment was a major decision, which could not be 
said - as the GOC had earlier made clear - to be justified by any It must therefore be regarded as a political act, 
military necessity. 
which would be thought to be directed against one faction and must accordingly be matched by some political action, in the form of a ban on marches, which would represent its counterpart in relation to the other faction. 
MR FAULKNER said that over the year as a whole there were a great many marches, many of which were small and local and gave rise to no trouble. They did not really come within the definition of the Northern Ireland Government’s statutory powers to ban, which were based on the burden on the security forces, the threat to law and order and damage to the commercial life of the community. It would be counterproductive to ban harmless demonstrations of this kind; all that was required was a ban on marches which were of particular significance or took place in especially sensitive areas. Moreover, it would be pointless to try to maintain a ban which might well prove to be unenforceable in the light of extreme Republican manifestations; and it would be quite impracticable to ban the march on 12th July. 
The details of any march, 
including its route, were always subject to police control and direction; and this sufficed to eliminate the element of provocation in the majority of cases. The marches on 12th July and 12th August were the only real flash-points in the year; for the rest the marches were too much a traditional part of the way of life in Northern Ireland to make it practicable to ban them indiscriminately. 
Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches. 
In further discussion British Ministers re-emphasised that internment would represent a major political decision which must be matched by some corresponding act of discipline against the other faction. Mr Faulkner’s point might be met, however, if the ban was expressed as lasting "until further notice" and was initially for a period of 6 months; as it had been on the last occasion. 
But the British Government would still reserve their right to reconsider the matter, without prejudice, at the end of that period.

As regards the public presentation of the decision to introduce internment and a ban on marches, it would be necessary to make it clear that it was the Government of Northern Ireland which had proposed this course after consultation with the United Kingdom Government. It would not be possible to say that this action was being taken on the basis of advice from the security forces since, although the Chief Constable of the RUC was now of this view, the GOC remained of the opinion that internment was not required on strictly military grounds. It might therefore be advisable to say that the Northern IrelandGovernment had reached their decision after weighing all the relevant considerations, including the views of the security forces, and after consulting the British Government. It would also be necessary to explain why internment had been adopted at this particular moment. The recent intensification of bomb outrages and the risk that these incidents would be multiplied still further on the eve of the 12th August march were perhaps sufficient grounds in themselves; but it would be preferable, from the point of view of the Government of Northern Ireland, to place the emphasis on the former consideration rather than the latter. In present circumstances the banning of marches could clearly be justified by reference to all three of the criteria which were the foundation of the Government of Northern Ireland’s statutory powers in this respect. 
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was essential that the tightest security should be maintained until the internment operation was launched - probably on the morning of the following Tuesday, 10th August. 
It must be for Mr Faulkner to decide how far 
he needed to consult some of his senior colleagues in his Cabinet who, although they had already declared their unanimous support for a policy of internment, had had no opportunity to discuss our counter suggestion of a ban on marches. But in so far as Mr Faulkner took them into his confidence, he must make it wholly clear to them that the British Cabinet would not acquiesce in internment unless marches were banned. As soon as the Government of Northern Ireland made the public announcement of internment the British Government would provide supporting Press briefing in London. There would be no harm in its becoming known at that stage that the consultation between the two Governments had taken place during Mr Faulkner’s visit. 
MR FAULKNER agreed to proceed accordingly and undertook to send the Home Secretary a draft of the Northern Ireland Government’s announcement. He said, however, that he would like to give further thought to the matter of the rifle clubs and would get in touch with the British Government again on the following day. He hoped that, if it became necessary to accelerate the meeting between the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Eire (at present envisaged for October), Mr. Lynch’s visit would not appear to be the direct result of developments in Ulster.

this afternoon. 
The Home Secretary has been talking to Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner seems now to be firmly 
of the opinion that internment is desirable. He asked 
to come to see the Home Secretary to discuss this tomorrow, and the Home Secretary has now agreed that he should do so. 
The time provisionally fixed is 4 p.m. 
not intended that the visit should be announced in advance. 
It is No effort will be made to conceal it, and 
when questions are asked it will be said that this is a regular meeting to discuss the situation, such as takes place between the Home Secretary and Mr. Faulkner from time to time. 
There is an awkward problem of timing 
because of the debate on Northern Ireland to which the Lord President is to reply which is likely to begin at about 12.30 p.m. and will go on either until it collapses or until 5 p.m. 
The Lord President had thought that it might collapse at about 3 p.m. It would 
be difficult for the Lord President not to refer to the meeting in his speech. 
It is clearly desirable that 
you should have a talk with the Home Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and Defence Secretary about the handling of Mr. Faulkner, and also that the Lord President should be there so that he has the necessary background knowledge for the debate. therefore arranged a meeting at 10.30 a.m. 
This will 
of course not leave you much time as you will need to start your Questions briefing at 11 a.m. or soon after.

Before we knew about the latest conversation with 
Mr. Faulkner, it had already been suggested that you should have a short meeting tomorrow to discuss the report on Clandestine Action which I attach.

Sir Burke Trend is seeking the agreement of Ministers that planning for all the operations should be brought up to as high a state of readiness as possible, but that no action should be initiated until the l2th of August has come and gone.

MESSAGE TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND FROM THE HOME SECRETARY 
I said I would set out the position as clearly as I can. The decision whether to proceed to internment is yours to make under the 
Constitution but it is our mutual understanding, particularly in view of the involvement of UK forces, that such a decision would be agreed beforehand with us. You had yourself often said, and I have supported this view, that you would be guided by the recommendations of the security authorities. 
As I understand it the GOC is not in present circumstances recommending 
internment on military grounds. This of course is the basis on which he would advise Ministers of either Government who would be responsible for the decision. It would be for them to take into account the political considerations which are numerous and complex. 
I understand that pressure for internment is considerable and I agree that 
it may well become necessary. I have stated in public that we would raise no objection to internment if we were satisfied on the advice of the security authorities and after consultation with you on the wider aspects that this would help in the campaign against the IRA. I have further stressed that no prior announcement would be possible or desirable. This remains our position. 
We must look at the immediate situation against the background of the 
Apprentice Boys march on 12 August. If internment were introduced before then it would in our view be essential to proceed simultaneously with the indefinite banning of all political processions. I understand it is the GOC’s view on military grounds that he would not advise the banning of the procession. If the procession is to proceed it seems to me to be wiser to postpone any decision about internment until after it has taken place when we can review the situation again on the existing principles and wholly without prejudice to a decision either way. As so much attention has been paid to this march on 12 August its outcome one way or another will be of considerale significance for any decision about the future conduct of the campaign against the terrorists. 
This is the position as I see it. I should be most grateful for your comments. 
As I said, I would be very happy to see you if you would care to come and discuss it here but I rather share your view that the publicity attending such a visit would inevitably create a very difficult situation.

Before Ministers finally disperse we ought to be clear where we stand, 
particularly if the Home Secretary is to meet Mr. Faulkner later in the week. You will also need:(a) To obtain from the Cabinet delegated authority for yourself, the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence to take whatever action may be required by developments during the next few weeks. (But, if we move to direct rule, the Cabinet - ? and Parliament will presumably have to be summoned). (b) To inform the Cabinet that the Home Secretary will take charge of the Government, except in a very grave emergency, next week. (c) To decide how and when (b) should be made publicly known. 
In so far as internment will be a critical issue at the Home Secretary’s meeting with Mr. Faulkner, we need to weigh a number of factors - the

reaction of the Irish Republic; the practical and political impact of internment in Northern Ireland (including the implications for the march on 12th August); and ways and means. Reaction of the Irish Republic 3. 
You will have seen Dublin telegrams Nos. 291 and 292, which make it 
clear that Mr. Lynch cannot afford to co-operate by introducing internment in the South and thinks it unlikely that a situation would arise when he would need it for his own purposes. He asks earnestly that there should be very serious reflection before the step is taken. 
In telegram No. 291 it is said that 
Mr. Lynch said he might be pressed to express his objections to internment. How far might these be pressed? Would he, for example, have to go to the length of raising the matter in the United Nations in order to preserve his own position ? 4. 
some advance warning. Note that the Dail is expected to rise on 6th August. 5. 
And, if we intern, we must be ready to move to direct rule at short 
notice thereafter. The necessary plans and arrangements for this purpose should therefore be completed. 
If the decision to intern is taken, it would seem right to give Mr. Lynch

Practical Effectiveness in Northern Ireland 6. 
Internment, if it can be made effective on the basis of being limited to 
Northern Ireland, should have a damaging effect on the IRA’s operations, although it would be unlikely to put an end to terrorism completely. 
But 
it would also lead to retaliation, not only in the form of rioting but also by way of taking hostages both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain. You will want specifically to ascertain the views of the GOC and the Chief Constable.

It seems essential that a decision to intern should be accompanied Internment would strengthen Mr. Faulkner’s position; but at some 
long-term cost. Mr. Lynch is probably right in saying that it would lead to greater polarisation of opinion and that it would make it harder to promote policies of co-operation and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Ways and Means 8. 
at 48 hours’ notice and 300 at 14 days’ notice. 
It was reported last week that HMS Maidstone could take 150 internees Up to 150 could be taken at 
Long Kesh by September; and a further 300 in November. Plans have been made to accommodate in prisons and in HMS Maidstone all the suspects whom we would be able to take (about 250) until Long Kesh was ready. 9. 
You will wish to enquire about the procedure: whether the suspects 
would immediately be interned or held pending internment or trial on a criminal charge. Has the Home Secretary any idea how long internment would be likely to last? Could the courts cope? And what machinery is there for reviewing cases ? 10. 
If Parliament rises before the decision is announced, no doubt there will be a clamour for its recall! Do we ignore it?

The Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary had a 
discussion with the Prime Minister in his room at the House of Commons at 5.45 p.m. on Monday, 2 August about the possibility of introducing internment in Northern Ireland. The Home Secretary said that earlier in the day 
Mr. Faulkner had given the impression that, if he were to visit London later in the week, he might express the view that it was now desirable to introduce internment. He had implied that General Tuzo might now favour this. Later information had however suggested that Mr. Faulkner had not intended to imply this. The Defence Secretary 
confirmed, after consultation with the Chief of the that 
General Staff, that General Tuzo still felt/the introduction of internment would have, on balance, a harmful effect on the security situation in Northern Ireland. The Home Secretary said that he thought that a ban on the 
Derry March on 12 August would not be politically acceptable unless it was part of a package which also included internment. He had therefore concluded that a ban on the March should not be pursued further. In these circumstances he doubted whether there would be advantage in asking Mr. Faulkner to come to London for talks later in the week. 
The Prime Minister said that there will be an oppor- 
tunity to report the issues briefly to the Cabinet the following day. The Cabinet might be willing to leave the decision on internment and the ban to be settled by

himself, in consultation with the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary,in the light of the developing situation. He did not in any event think that it would be desirable for Mr. Faulkner to come to London before Thursday, 5 August as there would be a danger of provoking a further application for an emergency debate before the House rose.

TO FLASH FCO TELNO 290 OF 30 JULY INFO PRIORITY UKREP BELFAST. 
YOUR TELEGRAM 148. I SAW THE TAOISEACH AT 3.00 P.M. TODAY AND HAD A LONG AND FRANK DISCUSSION. I PREFIXED IT BY SAYING THAT OSTENSIBLY, IF MY VISIT WERE NOTICED, IT CONCERNED HIS VISIT TO LONDON, BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS TO DISCUSS A SECRET MATTER, AND THE FACT THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED IT WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED. I THEN SHOWED HIM THE AGREED TEXT AND SPOKE AS INSTRUCTED. I MADE TWO COMMENTS, FIRST THAT THE RECURRING WORD PARALLEL DID NOT MEAN SIMULTANEOUS OR CONCERTED, AND SECONDLY THAT THE WORD HYPOTHETICAL IN THE PENULTIMATE PARAGRAPH ONLY MEANT THAT NO FINAL DECISION HAD YET BEEN TAKEN. 
2. MR. LYNCH STUDIED THE DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND HANDED IT BACK. HE SAID THAT HE COULD STATE CATEGORICALLY THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY CONTEMPLATE INTERNMENT AT THE PRESENT TIME, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE GROUNDS FOR DOING SO, AND IF HE TRIED TO INTRODUCE IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF OUR DOING SO, NEITHER HIS NOR ANY IRISH GOVERNMENT COULD SURVIVE SUCH A MEASURE. IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD THREATENED IT IN A SPECIAL INTERNAL SITUATION LAST DECEMBER, AND THE THREAT HAD APPARENTLY SUCCEEDED. HE COULD INTRODUCE IT AS A DRASTIC MEASURE IF THERE.WERE A TOTAL BREAKDOWN OF THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WAS FAR FROM PERFECT, BUT NEITHER NOW NOR IN THE VISIBLE FUTURE DID THERE SEEM TO BE ANY GROUNDS FOR INTRODUCING INTERNMENT. IN REPLY TO A COMMENT, HE SAID THAT A MASSIVE INFLUX OF I.R.A. FROM THE NORTH MIGHT CAUSE SOME FURTHER LAWLESSNESS IN THE SOUTH, BUT HE WOULD NOT EXPECT IT TO BE UNMANAGEABLE AND IT OFFERED NO GROUNDS FOR PREVENTIVE ACTION IN ADVANCE. 
3. MR. LYNCH THEN URGED THAT WE SHOULD REFLECT VERY SERIOUSLY BEFORE TAKING THE GRAVE STEP OF INTRODUCING INTERNMENT IN THE NORTH. HE FEARED THAT IT WOULD PRODUCE AN EXPLOSION WHICH IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTAIN. WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW, HE SAID THAT IN THE PRESENT SITUATION, QUOTE IF YOU ROUND UP 1,00

PEOPLE AND INTERN 20 BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD, YOU IMMEDIATELY MAKE BAD PEOPLE OF THE OTHER 99 UNQUOTE: WITH THE EXTREME UNIONISTS APPARENTLY ON THE RAMPAGE, ALL THE MODERATES WOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE INTERNEES. (THIS OF COURSE IS THE ESSENCE OF HIS ARGUMENT THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE SECURITY SITUATION IS POLITICAL, AND HE CANNOT BE SHAKEN ON THIS). 
4. I THEN REFERRED TO THE ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF DIRECT RULE, AND ASKED HIM HOW HE FELT ABOUT THAT. PARA 1 OF MY TELNO 284 GIVES A VERY FAIR SUMMARY OF THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REPLY. WHEN I PRESSED HIM HE SAID HE WOULD PREFER IT TO A GENERAL ELECTION AND A PAISLEY-LED GOVERNMENT. BUT HE REVERTED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM OF THE UNWISDOM OF INTERNMENT, SAYING THAT SURELY WE HAD ENOUGH TROOPS, POLICE, AND INTELLIGENCE RESOURCES TO MANAGE WITHOUT IT. HIS GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER HAND HAD VERY FEW OF EACH 
- A POINT WHICH ENABLED ME TO TOUCH ON CO-OPERATION ALONG THE BORDER. 
5. MR. LYNCH’S VIEW ON THIS WAS THAT POLICE CO-OPERATION WAS FUNCTIONING DISCREETLY: THERE WERE NO MEANS OF ORGANISING ANY PLANNED MILITARY CO-OPERATION, BUT IF AD HOC AND BY CHANCE A PATROL ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER PASSED A FRIENDLY WORD TO ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE, NO HARM WOULD BE DONE. I THINK THIS WAS A CASUAL REMARK WITHOUT GREAT SIGNIFICANCE, AND THE FACT IS THAT POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS APART, THE IRISH DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MILITARY RESOURCES FOR PLANNED AND COORDINATED PATROLLING. 
6. FINALLY MR. LYNCH ASKED ME WHEN A DECISION WAS LIKELY TO BE TAKEN ON INTERNMENT. I QUOTED (PARA 2 OF YOUR TELNO 147) THAT IT MIGHT ARISE AT ANY TIME FROM NOW ON, BUT WHEN HE ASKED IF IT WAS LIKELY THIS WEEKEND I SAID I THOUGHT NOT.

30 JULY, 
YOUR TELEGRAMS NUMBER 283 AND 284. YOU SHOULD SEEK EARLIEST POSSIBLE MEETING WITH MR. LYNCH, IF POSSIBLE ON 31 JULY AND RAISE THE INTERNMENT QUESTION WITH HIM. OSTENSIBLE REASON FOR YOUR CALL MIGHT BE TO FOLLOW UP YESTERDAY’S ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS VISIT TO LONDON IN OCTOBER, TO ASCERTAIN OF WHOM HIS PARTY WILL CONSIST AND WHETHER HE HAS ANY PARTICULAR WISHES ABOUT THE PROGRAMME. 
2. APPROACH SHOULD BE ON THE BASIS OF TEXT IN MY TELNO 147 OF 27 JULY INCORPORATING THE CHANGES SUGGESTED IN PARA. 3 OF YOUR TELNO 283 YOU MAY GO THROUGH THE TEXT BUT SHOULD NOT LEAVE A COPY WITH HIM. 
WITH REGARD TO YOUR PARA. 4 (V) THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO YOUR REFERRING TO PRESSURES, BUT YOU SHOULD STRESS THAT DECISION WOULD BE BASED ON SECURITY ASSESSMENT. 
3. FOR YOUR PERSONAL.INFORMATION ONLY, MINISTERS ARE CONTEMPLATING A DISCUSSION, PROBABLY EARLY NEXT WEEK, WITH MR. FAULKNER. THEY HAVE IT IN MIND TO EXPLORE WITH HIM THE POSSIBILITY OF A BAN ON ALL MARCHES INCLUDING THAT OF 12 AUGUST, AND WHETHER THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY AS PART OF A PACKAGE DEAL WHICH WOULD ALSO INCLUDE INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
4. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND YOU SHOULD BE GUIDED BY FOLLOWING ON THE POINTS OF SUBSTANCE: (A) THE APPROACH IS NOT PURELY HYPOTHETICAL BUT ALONG THE LINES OF THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE IN PARA. 1 OF YOUR TEL 283. YOU CAN SAY THAT RECENT EVENTS HAVE OBVIOUSLY STRENGTHENED THE PROBABILITIES OF INTERNMENT BEING INTRODUCED IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND IT IS BEING SERIOUSLY THOUGHT ABOUT AS A POSSIBLE NEXT MOVE. WE THEREFORE SHOULD BE GRTATEFUL FOR A SUBSTANTIVE REACTION ON THIS

POINT FROM MR. LYNCH. WE HOPE THAT ANY CONSULTATIONS WILL BE KEPT VERY CLOSE AND AVOID DANGER OF LEAKAGE. INDICATION OF HIS IMMEDIATE VIEWS WOULD BE VALUABLE. 
(B) IN REGARD TO 12 AUGUST, YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT AND HMG ARE BOTH STILL CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE AND THAT YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO REPORT ANY FURTHER VIEWS WHICH MR. LYNCH WISHES TO EXPRESS ABOUT IT. I SHOULD ALSO BE GLAD TO KNOW WHAT YOUR OWN IMPRESSIONS ARE OF THE IMPORTANCE TO MR. LYNCH’S GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE BAN ON THIS MARCH AND ON ALL OTHER MARCHES IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
(C) WITH REGARD TO YOUR TELNO 284 I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF YOU COULD DRAW OUT MR. LYNCH ON THE SUBJECT OF DIRECT RULE. 
5. MINISTERS IN REVIEWING THE SITUATION CONSIDERED THAT THERE WOULD BE GREAT VALUE IN ARRANGING JOINT PATROLLING OF THE BORDER BY IRISH AND UK SECURITY FORCES, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR INTERNMENT, AND WHETHER OR NOT MR. LYNCH WILL COOPERATE ON THE LATTER. THIS WOULD NECESSARILY BE OVERT, SINCE TO BE EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MILITARY ON BOTH SIDES TO MEET AT THE PLANNING LEVEL TO COORDINATE THEIR PATROLLING ACTIVITIES. IT THUS GOES FURTHER THAN PRESENT IRISH PATROLLING ARRANGEMENTS. I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD SOUND MR. LYNCH ON THIS AT THE SAME TIME.

TO UKREP BELFAST. M.I.P.T.: DIRECT RULE. 1. THE IRISH GOVERNMENT’S ATTITUDE TO DIRECT RULE IS FLUID AND AT TIMES SCHIZOPHRENIC. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY WOULD WELCOME IT IF IT PREVENTED A STORONT GOVERNMENT LED BY CRAIG OR PAISLEY: OR IF IT MARKED THE END OF UNIONIST RULE IN STORMONT: AND AS EVIDENCE THAT HMG ACCEPTED THAT THE 1921 SETTLEMENT WAS UNWORKABLE AND ANOTHER ’’ SOLUTION’’ HAD TO BE FOUND. ON THE OTHER HAND, DIRECT RULE WOULD MAKE MR. LYNCH’S POLICY OF SETTLING THE PARTITION PROBLEM BETWEEN TWO IRISH ’’TRADITIONS’’ LESS PLAUSIBLE, THERE WOULD BE A DANGER THAT IN TIME NORTHERN IRELAND MIGHT BECOME EVEN MORE INTEGRATED INTO THE U.K. AND IT WOULD FINALLY REMOVE THE ARENA OF ARGUMENT FROM BELFAST, WHERE THE MINORITY AT LEAST HAVE A VOICE, TO WESTMINSTER WHERE IN EFFECT THEY DO NOT. (THIS ARGUMENT HAS LESS FORCE NOW THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS LEFT STORMONT). PUBLICLY, AND PROBABLY IN FACT, THE FORMER VIEW WOULD PREVAIL. 
2. IN THE CONTEXT OF A TALK WITH MR LYNCH ABOUT INTERNMENT, THE POINT ABOUT DIRECT RULE IS RELEVANT IN THREE CASES: FIRST AS AN ALTERNATIVE - I.E. IF HMG HAD DECIDED THAT THEY THEMSELVES WOULD NOT INTRODUCE INTERNMENT, BUT WOULD ASSUME CONTROL OF EVENTS INSTEAD: SECONDLY, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTERNING AS MANY PROTESTANTS AS I R A EXTREMISTS, RESULTING IN THE COLLAPSE OF MR. FAULKNER’S GOVERNMENT UNDER RIGHT-WING INDIGNATION: THIRDLY, IF HMG ASSUMED DIRECT RULE AND AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCED INTERNMENT. BUT IN ANY CASE, A DECISION TO INTRODUCE INTERNMENT, APPARENTLY TAKEN BY THE FAULKNER GOVERNMENT, WOULD BE REGARDED IN DUBLIN AS AN INSTANCE OF DIRECT RULE SINCE THE IRISH GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT THE DECISION WOULD IN EFFECT BE TAKEN IN LONDON.

3. I REALISE THAT THIS IS PRETTY INCONCLUSIVE ADVICE ON HOW THE ISSUE SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH MR LYNCH. WE HAVE NATURALLY NOT DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT FULLY WITH THE IRISH, AND THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PUBLIC TALK ABOUT IT RECENTLY. BUT BY MERELY MENTIONING DIRECT RULE I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DRAW OUT MR LYNCH ON THE SUBJECT.

prohibited; and, instead, a meeting was held on the other side of the river from the Bogside and Creggan. There were attempts to force a way across the bridges; but grave disorder was avoided. Merely to reroute the march may therefore be contrasted unfavourably with last year’s action. On the other hand it appears that the traditional route of the march differs from year to year and that there is a recognised cycle of routes. 
If so (and this should 
be confirmed), the rerouting of this year’s march away from the Bogside may be regarded as equivalent in its effects to the steps taken last year.

If, on the other hand, the GOC is prepared to take a 
chance in terms of security, the political advantage to Mr. Faulkner of allowing the march to take place (subject to whatever stipulations the GOC may require) should probably be the determining consideration. 5. 
In reaching their decision the Committee will need to take account of 
telegram No. 274 of 26th July from HM Ambassador in Dublin, which emphasises that the pressure from the Republic for an outright ban on the march derives not just from the IRA but from the Government itself at all levels. A ban would therefore imply capitulation to Republican views; and the Committee must consider how far this might be mitigated by the new measures of harassment of the IRA recently undertaken by the Army. 6. 
There can 
presum bly be no question of yielding to pressure of this kind. 7. 
The GOC 
On security generally you might like to ask the Home Secretary about extreme Protestant suggestions for raising a citizens’ militia. 
One cannot help feeling that if, as is commonly supposed, internment 
is the ’last stop before direct rule", we should be chary of adopting it until we are compelled to. And the Committee will wish to hear from the GOC how far he regards the new measures of harassment as in some sense an alternative to internment; and, if so, how long they are likely to remain effective for this purpose. 
rather than later, to adopt a policy of internment, two questions arise. But if we are likely to be driven, perhaps sooner First, 
how effective would internment in the North be, whether or not we could secure co-operation from Mr. Lynch? Second, how might we secure this co-operation ? 8. 
On the first of these issues the Official Committee asked for 
an assessment from the GOC on the effectiveness of internment limited to the North; and the Committee will wish to hear his opinion. A poor initial rate of arrests is perhaps not the only criterion. 
Other important

factors are the availability of facilities (and how ready are the internment camps?) and the likely extent and character of Republican retaliation. There is also the question of timing. There was a strong view at Cabinet last week that internment should precede direct rule, particularly since we might well be creating subsequent political embarrassment for ourselves if we needed, under direct rule, to use a weapon which we had earlier denied to the Northern Ireland Government. But this assumes that events will allow us to move in orderly sequence from harassment to internment and from internment to direct rule. And this may not be so. However reluctant we may be to adopt internment, we must not leave it too late and expose ourselves to the charge that it might have made all the difference (to the lives of British soldiers, among other things) if only we had introduced it in time. 9. 
On the second issue the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary argued 
that the response of Mr. Lynch should not be the sole criterion for taking the decision on internment. True: but we must still have regard to his views and the Official Committee have therefore considered how an approach might best be made to the Government of the Republic. They could be approached only when a provisional decision had been taken to agree to internment in the North. But that kind of approach was thought likely to be unproductive; especially since the information would leak before internment had actually begun and this would jeopardise the success of the operation. The better course, in the view of the Official Committee, would be to approach Mr. Lynch soon after 12th August on the footing that internment was a possibility which we had to consider. Even so, he would be unlikely to agree to adopt it in the South, unless we could persuade him that it was to his own advantage. The Official Committee therefore recommended that HM Ambassador in Dublin should be informed of our thinking at once in order that he might advise us about the best approach; and telegrams have been sent to him accordingly. The main factors involved are:(a) The outcome of 12th August in Londonderry. If the march is not 
banned and there is serious trouble as a result, internment will become a more pressing issue; but Mr. Lynch may be more reluctant to collaborate than if we had banned the march. (b) The future of the proposal for a full-time unit of the UDR. A decision 
to form such a unit would not help us in talking to Mr. Lynch. [ Incidentally, it is proposed to place certain members of the UDR on full-time duties, under

existing powers,to assist in guarding police stations. The distinction between this step and the formation of a full-time unit would have to be explained not only to Mr. Lynch but to the Opposition here). (c) The incident in which an Army patrol were shot at from across the 
Border. But this will not necessarily cut much ice with Mr. Lynch! 10. 
The reply to Mr. Lynch’s recent letter to you will therefore require 
particularly careful thought in the light of the approach which we may subsequently need to make to him about internment. 
But it seems preferable 
to defer that approach till after 12th August, unless an earlier decision is taken to ban the Londonderry march. Direct Rule 11. 
Here, too, there are two questions. First, what should be the 
occasion for a resort to direct rule? Second, what should be the machinery for the exercise of executive power ? 12. 
When the Committee considered the possible occasions for intervention 
on 17th March, it was suggested that there might be advantage in waiting until it was clear that unacceptable policies were being pursued rather than intervening on the basis that an unacceptable leader had been elected. But we have come some way since then; and it must be doubtful whether there is any acceptable leader to follow Mr. Faulkner. 
The danger of 
waiting for unacceptable policies is that a new leader might take irreversible action 
- such as rearming the RUC and raising a Protestant militia - the 
moment he assumed office. And there is also the danger of excessive strain on the loyalty of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and police. On the other hand intervention on the basis merely of an unacceptable individual would mean very speedy, and, (if Parliament here were in Recess) pretty high-handed, action. 13. 
The question how executive power should be exercised is partly a 
matter of verifying that all the preparations for direct rule have been completed and can be implemented at short notice if necessary (and this is something which the Committee should specifically check tomorrow) and partly a matter of settling the outstanding question whether executive power should be vested:(a) as regards matters of day-to-day decisions in a specially selected Governor; 
(b) 
in a Minister with exclusive responsibility for Northern Ireland (?but located at Westminster or at Stormont);

21st July 1971 We have been giving fresh consideration both to the 
operational tactics to be used by the Army in Northern Ireland, and to the force level required there, during the next few weeks in the light of two factors: the increased level of IRA terrorism during recent weeks, and the march of the Protestant Apprentice Boys which traditionally takes place in Londonderry on 12th August. The Prime Minister will wish to be aware of the conclusions which have been reached. 
As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment. 
It would be primarily a political decision whether to 
bring in internment, but it would depend very much on military advice. The view of the GOC, with which the Defence Secretary entirely agrees, is that the arguments against resorting to internment remain very strong and that other possibilities for disrupting the IRA should certainly be tried first. On this basis the GOC has proposed a new operational approach designed to make life as difficult as possible for those people who are known to be leading IRA activists and so to give them the minimum

scope for either operating as terrorists themselves or for organising attacks and riots. He intends to do this mainly by frequently descending upon them to search their houses and, if they are actually found, by periodically arresting them on suspicion and where appropriate holding them for up to 48 hours for interrogation. The GOC believes that a policy of continuous harassment on these lines stands a good chance of disrupting the IRA’s organisation and activities to an extent that would be very valuable in both military and political terms. 
It has been confirmed that Mr. Faulkner is in favour 
of this approach; and both the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary have now approved it in principle. Lord Carrington has however stipulated that on each occasion when the new policy is put into effect it must be presented as the consequence of some recent outbreak of terrorism on the IRA’s part, rather than as an initiative on the part of the Army. 
The adoption of this operational approach has a bearing 
on the Apprentice Boys March. We understand that the present view at Stormont is that the march should be allowed to take 
place, but that the traditional route must certainly be altered so as to avoid the city walls where they look down on the Bogside (which has proved a flash-point in the past, not least in 1969). It is thought that the march organisers are much more likely to be prepared to cooperate in such re-routing if, in the meantime, some positive action is seen to be taken against IRA leaders. The GOCtherefore plans to make a start with the harassment tactics before the end of this month (which will of course be presented as a response to the recent outbreaks of violence)and he will shortly be reporting the details of these plans. 
With regard to the force level,I mentioned in my letter 
of 24th June about reinforcements for July that the GOC then considered that he would also need a temporary reinforcement of two extra units to cover 12th August in Londonderry, though this would be reviewed nearer the time. The present position is that the three extra units which were sent over for the July Orange parades have all now returned (the number of major units at present in Northern Ireland in the infantry role thus reverting to twelve); and the GOC has confirmed that he expects to need a temporary reinforcement of two units to cover the Apprentice Boys March. However, because he will in the meantime be bringing in the harassment policy he has asked to have the two extra units slightly longer than originally envisaged. Accordingly, in Lord Carrington’s absence,

NORTHERN IRELAND DRAFT STATEMENT 
Political progress in Northern Ireland is bound to be impeded so long as 
violence and intimidation continue; and the purpose of internment, and of the Army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. The Border is not at issue. 
Nor is the constitutional position of 
Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and, within this framework, the principle of a democratically elected assembly based on universal adult suffrage. But the reform programme which has been and continues to be carried through 
and to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are fully committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr. Faulkner’s recent initiative, have pointed the way forward. 
In discussion 
between the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and United Kingdom Ministers it was agreed that it would be helpful if the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland were to invite the Home Secretary to arrange as soon as the security situation has sufficiently improved talks under his chairmanship with the Northern Ireland Government, representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament and of other representatives of the majority and minority communities. The purpose of these discussions will be to see what agreed ways and means 
can be devised, within the constitutional and democratic framework, of giving representatives of the minority as well as of the majority community in Northern Ireland an active in the life and 
permanent role, the Province. 2nd September, 1971

Cabinet: Northern Ireland You last reported the general situation to the Cabinet on 16th August. 
At that juncture the arrests prior to internment had taken place; Mr. Lynch had delivered the first of his public statements about the replacement of the Northern Ireland Government by a body on which the minority community would have equal representation with the majority; Mr. Faulkner, however, had felt unable to associate himself with the initiative for a meeting with representatives of the communities in Northern Ireland to discuss giving the minority a more active role in the processes of government; and Mr. Harold Wilson had made his informal approach to you about the recall of Parliament. 2. 
The main developments since 16th August are as follows:- 
(a) The meeting with Mr. Faulkner at Chequers on 19th August, when he agreed that he would put to his Cabinet the proposal to hold a meeting about giving the minority a role in the Government, provided that it was made clear that this was to be within the constitutional framework of majority rule in Northern Ireland. A somewhat revised proposition has now been sent to Mr. Faulkner to consider. 
(b) Mr. Lynch’s second public statement, immediately following the meeting at Chequers; and your reply. 
(c) The inquiry, announced today, into "brutality" by the security forces by Sir Edmund Compton, Mr. E. S. Fay and Dr. Donald Gibson with the following terms of reference:"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". 
(d) The formal request for the recall of Parliament. (e) The current security situation 
- continuing explosions, notably at 
the Electricity Board offices, and continued attacks on the Army, particularly the Border incident at Crossmaglen. The GoC is to review measures to protect the Border, including the cratering of unapproved roads; and his report is expected very shortly.

PRIME MINISTER FROM PETER GREGSON YOU ASKED FOR A FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE POPE’S REMARKS. 
THE NEXT MESSAGE CONTAINS THE BEST TEXT WHICH OUR MINISTER HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEND SO FAR. WE DO NOT YET HAVE HIS ASSESSMENT BUT THE FCO ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POPE WAS TRYING QUITE HARD TO BE HELPFUL TO US BY HIS APPEAL FOR PEACE AND BY THE VERY CAREFULLY DRAFTED PHRASING OF HIS, IN THEIR VIEW INEVITABLE, REFERENCE TO INTERNMENT. THEY ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER WE OUGHT TO SEND A FURTHER MESSAGE TO THE POPE. WE ASKED OUR MINISTER TO GIVE HIM A COPY OF THE WHITE PAPER LAST WEEK. 
TEXT OF MESSAGE FROM THE HOLY SEE NORTHERN IRELAND TEXT BEGINS: WE CANNOT TODAY IN THIS TRANQUIL SUNDAY MEETING FORGET A COUNTRY THAT LIKE OTHER REGIONS SADDENED BY BLOODY AND HATE RIDDEN CONFLICTS, TODAY ATTRACTS THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE WORLD: NORTHERN IRELAND, WHERE THE SITUATION HAS RECENTLY BECOME MORE BITTER AND HAS WORSENED FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES OF SECURITY WHICH 
STRONGLY RESENTED BY AT LEAST 
A PART OF THE INHABITANTS. WE WILL NOT CEASE TO INVOKE DIVINE HELP IN SUCH CONDITIONS, THAT DIVINE INTERVENTION SHOULD ILLUMINE AND SUSTAIN THE GOODWILL OF THOSE WHO INTEND TO DEDICATE THEMSELVES TO HIGHLY MERITORIOUS WORKS IN THE EYES OF GOD AND IN THE EYES OF HISTORY COLON TO BRING ABOUTA PEACEFUL AND JUST SOLUTION TO THE GRAVE HISTORICAL, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS WHICH AFFLICT THAT COMMUNITY. 
WE ARDENTLY DESIRE THAT UUR PRAYER SHOULD FIND AN ECHO IN EVERYONE FOR A RAPID AND GENEROUS RESPONSE SO THAT THE COUNTRY MAY BE SAVED FROM OTHER PAINFUL TRIALS: AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IN COMMON CHRISTIAN BELIEFS SHOULD IN BROTHERLY LOVE COME TOGETHER SO AS TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE GREAT GOOD OF TRUE PEACE IN THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST AND IN RECIPROCAL COLLABORATION. THIS CONSTITUTES THE SUREST PROMISE OF CIVIL AND MORAL PROGRESS OF SOCIETY ENDS

CONFIDENTIAL THE PROVISIONAL IRA IN DUBLIN HAVE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMB OUTRAGE IN BELFAST ON WEDNESDAY LAST. LAST WEEK THERE WAS PUBLICITY SHOWING PROVISIONALS PUBLICLY FUND RAISING IN DUBLIN FOR VIOLENT ACTION IN THE NORTH. THE IRISH ARE THEREFORE VERY VULNERABLE ON THIS POINT. 
NIGHT I SUGGEST THAT THE IRISH AMBASSADOR SHOULD BE SENT 
FOR AND CONFRONTED WITH THESE FACTS? I DO NOT RECOMMEND PROPOSING TO H I M THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT SHOULD INTRODUCE INTERNMENT ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS EVIDENCE. 
INSTEAD WOULD YOU 
CONSIDER POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT UNLESS THE IRISH GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE PROVISIONALSN, (AND WHETHER BY INTERNMENT, NEW LEGISLATION, OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS IS THEIR AFFAIR) THEIR CREDIBILITY AND STANDING IN RELATION TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE NORTH ARE GREATLY IMPAIRED. 
THE IMPACT WOULD BE GREATER IF IT CAME FROM LONDON, AND 
IT WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF CLEARING IT OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE THE PRIME MINISTERS MEET.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. FAULKNER AND 
PRIME MINISTER AT 10.00 a.m. ON SATURDAY, 28 AUGUST 1971 Exchanged greetings. 
PRIME MINISTERS PERSONAL MESSAGE 
MR. FAULKNER SERIAL Well, after our talk last night I had our Special 
Branch get the Attorney General’s Department in and we had another long discussion. I am afraid the end result does not take us any further. PRIME MINISTER I see. 
MR. FAULKNER They are satisfied that they have got nothing 
on which they could issue a warrant. If he landed here they would certainly lift him under the special powers but I gather that there is no hope of being able to use these outside Northern Ireland. PRIME MINISTER No, none at all. 
MR. FAULKNER No, it is unfortunate, but I am afraid that’s it. PRIME MINISTER In that case we shall have to send him back, and we 
had better get our people to co-ordinate the line they are taking with the press. MR. FAULKNER Yes, indeed. 
PRIME MINISTER It’s infuriating isn’t it. 
MR. FAULKNER Isn’t it infuriating.

And I do appreciate the way you have helped in this because if only something could be done it would be such a wonderful propaganda effort, if nothing else. But they seem to think that he is a clever bloke and he probably does keep clear of any personal involvement. PRIME MINISTER All right. Then that is what we Will have to do. 
MR. FAULKNER Right. Well shall I ask our people to get in touch 
with Whitehall to clear the PRIME MINISTER That’s right, the statement. 
MR. FAULKNER Yes. 
PRIME MINISTER Because we will have to answer questions when it 
comes. All right Brian thank you so much. MR. FAULKNER Thank you very much indeed, Ted.

the south. PRIME MINISTER Well if 
are absolutely sure that there is 
nothing, I mean, I just wanted to make certain that you had been over it with them. There is nothing that has emerged from the detainees which can MR. FAULKNER 
just Well apparently not. I wonder if I might/go back 
to them on this conspiracy business that you have mentioned. PRIME MINISTER Yes. 
MR FAULKNER In case there is anything on that 
PRIME MINISTER You see we can go on holding him under our 
immigration laws, but if there is no charge preferred, we should have in the end to send him back to Dublin and the general feeling is that if he has got to be sent back it is probably better to end him back earlier than later. MR. FAULKNER 
too I should think that is right because he could make 
a lot out of it if he is held for some time and then sent back. PRIME MINISTER 
The other/complication for us is that we do not allow political 
him in as an immigrant on the grounds that he is a danger to national security to which they will say if he is a danger to national security why on earth can’t you deal with him.

Well if you would like to have another word with your chaps about it. MR. FAULKNER I will do that and then come straight back to you. 
PRIME MINISTER Yes, or if you would like to talk to me at 
breakfast time. MR. FAULKNER Right I will do that. I will leave it till the 
morning. You had two hours with the Lord Mayor and his friends the day before yestereday. They came to report to me today and that took them two hours. PRIME MINISTER Yes, they do not do anything briefly. Well I hope 
they were not too dissatisfied. MR. FAULKNER No, I do not think they were. In fact I think they 
were quite pleased. I think they thought it was a good exercise. PRIME MINISTER Well, they did raise a lot of points which we are discussing - our people are discussing with your people. Ill night Brian, you are having another go with them.

27 August 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 20-26 AUGUST 1971 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
It has been a week when the possibilities of reconciliation 
between the leaders of the Northern Ireland communities seem to have become yet more remote. The parliamentary opposition rejected Mr. Faulkner’s proposal for a meeting and again turned to Mr. Lynch for support at a meeting in Dublin. More extreme Republican groups, led by the Brady IRA, continue to pursue separate plans for a nine-county 
parliament in opposition to the Social Democratic and our Party’s proposals. Roman Catholic 
owned premises in various towns in Northern Ireland have been shut down as a protest against Government policies and the Roman Catholic community seem now to be responding to the call to withhold rent. There continues to be little street activity but the incidence of explosions has been at least as high as before internment was introduced. 
2. In London the Government refused an official request from the 
Opposition to recall Parliament, although it was made clear that the possibility was being kept in mind. Mr. Wilson’s statement on 26th August about government policy in Northern Ireland seemed to call into question the continuance of a bi-partisan approach at Westminster. Mr. Heath met a delegation on 5th August led by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, which Opposition councillors had declined to join. 
SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
There have been about 20 reported explosions in Northern 
Ireland during the past week, of which all but three took place in Belfast. The most serious occurred on 25th August when about 201bs. of explosives detonated in occupied offices of the Electricity Board in South Belfast. One man was killed and 30 other people were taken to hospital, 16 of whom were detained. The incident led to widespread condemnation for its perpetrators, including messages from the Prime Minister, Mr. Faulkner and Cardinal Conway. It came at the end of a week of bomb explosions in Belfast which injured three people at a car showrooms on 20th August and two prison officers and two prisoners on 22nd August when a bomb exploded in the gateway of Belfast’s Crumlin Road Jail. Other targets included a Government office, a water board office, a college, a bar, a petrol station and a number of commercial premises. Elsewhere in Northern Ireland a telephone exchange was -1-

put out of action on 21st August in Armagh and later in the wok showrooms week showrooms were damaged in Lurgan and Dungannon. 
4. Belfast has also been the scene of a number of attacks on 
members of the security forces. Three shots wore fired at a guardroom on 20th August and a soldier wounded. A soldier, Private Crosier, on duty on top of the Flax Street mill Army quarters on 23rd August was killed by a shot from a sniper. On 25th August an off-duty RUC inspector was fired on and wounded and in another incident on the same day, shots failed to hit a sentry. 
5. There have been very few street incidents anywhere in 
Northern Ireland. Trouble continued in Londonderry on 20th August when stone-throwing gangs had to be dispersed with baton rounds and CS, but apart from a minor outbreak of trouble on 27th August, Londonderry has been markedly quieter than last week. On 21st August gangs set fire to a transformer in Strabane. Disturbances took place in Armagh on 25th August following a meeting which organised the building of barricades. These were eventually cleared but not before two shots had been fired at the military, causing minor injuries to two soldiers. During this incident two men, not the snipers, were arrested. Further barricades built on the following night were quickly cleared without incident. 
6. Civil rights and protest meetings took place somewhere in 
Northern Ireland on every day of the week, including Belfast, Londonderry, Armagh, Newry, Omagh, Magherafelt, Enniskillen, Maghera, Castledawson and Toomebridge. They were generally quite well attended and many were reported on in the Irish newspapers. 
7. Searches for arms and ammunition continued during the week 
and finds were made in Newry, Lurgan and Armagh on 20th August, and at Rostrevor and in the Unity Flats complex in Belfast on 25th August. 
POLITICAL SITUATION 8. 
agreed to a request from the GOC, Northern Ireland, to introduce an independent inquiry to investigate the evidence relevant to allegations made by those arrested under the Special Powers Act on 9th August 1971 about their treatment while in the custody of the security forces, prior to subsequent release, the serving of a detention order or the preferral of criminal charges. The news was fairly widely welcomed although the Social Democratic and Labour Party MP, Mr. Paddy Devlin, stated that: "it must be a serious inquiry, held immediately and controlled by a competent jury". Mr. Joe Burns, the right wing Unionist and Junior Government Minister, on the other hand, thought such an inquiry unnecessary. No further details of the inquiry have yet been announced. Most opposition groups, having given it a cautious welcome, are clearly suspending judgement until they know more of its details. 
It was announced on 21st August that the Government had

detention and on 26th August the total number of detainees was 243. Many of these on HMS Maidstone refused food from 23rd August 
A number of people continue to be arrested with a view to 
until 25th August. Newspapers reported it as a protest against detention and conditions. 
10. The White Paper promised by Mr. Faulkner last week (HONIP (71) 33 page 2) was published on 20th August and reported widely in the press the following day. It gives a full account of the reforms introduced over the last two year in the context of the 1969 Downing Street declaration. 
11. Mr. Faulkner made a further attempt on 24th August to define his position and renew communication between himself and opposition groups. While he reaffirmed the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, he made a point of denying emphatically that internment was aimed at repressing the Roman Catholic community and said that he would continue to consider still further measures which would give the parliamentary Opposition greater participation in the running of Northern Ireland. Neither would he abandon this, he said, in the face of "those on the other side of the political spectrum who cry ’betrayal’ at every sign of change and progress in the community". He warned the Opposition against making common cause with extremists and said he was willing to approach with them the problem in a non-partisan manner. The Social Democratic and Labour Party, however, announced that they were only interested in talks involving the Westminster Government and still sought the suspension of Stormont. Mr. Devlin M.P. accused Mr. Faulkner of hypocrisy. 
12. This response only confirmed the Social Democratic and Labour Party’s concentration on activities outside the parliamentary framework with the aim that existing constitutional arrangements will be brought down. All the party’s MPs and all the Nationalist MPs met Mr. Lynch in Dublin on 23rd August. The Republican Labour M.P., Mr. Paddy Kennedy, refused the invitation,having thrown in his lot with the Dail Ulaidh (see paragraph 13). Details of the discussion were not revealed but it was reported that the meeting was amicable and a brief statement said that it had been agreed that the objective of equality of treatment for everyone in Northern Ireland should be pursued by non-violent political means. Mr. Lynch also acknowledged that the elected Opposition members were the principal representative body of the non-Unionist community. The Northern Iroland MPs later met members of the Irish Republic’s Opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. 
13. The statement therefore makes it clear that Mr. Lynch’s 
moral support for the campaign to end Stormont does not extend to backing the proposals of the more extreme Republicans for a ninecounty Parliament (Dail Ulaidh) covering the traditional counties of Ulster. This proposal was discussed at a meeting in the Irish Republic in Monaghan on 21st August. Those present included

together for discussions on achieving this. It was made known that Westminster did not intend to continue the exchange of public statements and counter-statements. A statement later in the week by the Goulding wing of the Sinn Fein political movement affirmed that Mr. Lynch’s statements were a forerunner of his introducing internment without it being thought that he was giving into pressure from Westminster. The group repeated its belief that internment was near, a view apparently not shared by other commentators, after Dublin police raided their headquarters and took away some of their documents. As reported in paragraph 16 of HONIP(71) 29, Cathal Goulding, head of the ’Official’ IRA, appeared in court on 26th July on incitement charges. He was remanded on bail until 3rd September. 
COURT PROCEEDINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
18. The Social Democratic and Labour Party MPs Mr. Hume and Mr. Cooper appeared in court on 23rd August (HONIP(71) 33 page 2), with three other men. Charges against all of them were adjourned until 6th September. 
SCOTLAND YARD DETECTIVES RETURN 
19. Newspapers reported the return to London of the Scotland Yard detectives, led by Detective Chief Inspector Peyton, (HONIP(71) 7 paragraph 20). The official announcement simply said that their inquiries had reached the stage when their presence was no longer necessary but many newspapers speculated that the known murderers were irretrievably in the Irish Republic. 
NOTIFICATION TO COUNCIL OF EUROPE 
20. As required by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,the United Kingdom Government informed the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 20th August of the Northern Ireland Government’s decision to introduce internment without trial. The text of the notice was not released.

London S.W.1 27 August, 1971 
With your letter of 26 August you enclosed a telegram 
instructing HM Ambassador in Dublin to press Mr. Lynch to bring forward the date of their meeting. 
Mr. Lynch is out of Dublin, and his Private Secretary 
does not know his exact whereabouts. Sir John Peck might be able to establish communication by telephone, but this is at best doubtful and moreover hardly the way to conduct the sort of discussion that the Prime Minister’s message will involve. The Ambassador is reluctant to pursue Mr. Lynch by car, since he cannot move inconspicuously (he always has a Police escort) and the Press would very probably notice. Moreover the Ambassador considers it likely that Mr. Lynch would not give a firm reply until he had had an opportunity to discuss the idea with colleagues in Dublin, probably on Monday 
- which is not a Bank Holiday in Ireland. The Ambassador could of course act through the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, but again he feels this is a discussion he should handle himself, and not through a Duty Officer. 
He therefore proposes to act as soon as he can next 
week, when Mr. Lynch returns to Dublin. In our view this is right; there is always the possibility that Mr. Lynch may demur on the timing, and there is enough fevered speculation as it is in Ireland without causing more by a spectacular cross-country dash over the weekend. But I would be grateful for confirmation that this is acceptable.

We are assuming that the Prime Minister envisages a 
the British Press that the Republic might be proceeding with internment on their own (paragraph 4 of the telegram we sent last night) can be dismissed as wishful thinking.

Political progress in Northern Ireland is bound to be impeded so long as violence and intimidation continue; and the purpose of internment, and of the Army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. 
The Border is not at issue. Nor is the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and, within this framework, the principle of democratically elected assembly based on universal adult suffrage. 
But the reform programme which has been and continues to be carried through and to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are fully committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr Faulkner’s recent initiative, have pointed the way forward. In discussion between the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and UK Ministers it was agreed that it would be helpful if the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland were to invite the Home Secretary to arrange as soon as the security situation has sufficiently improved 
talks under his chairmanship with the 
Northern Ireland Government, representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament and of all sections of the Northern Ireland community. 
The purpose of these discussions will be to see what further ways and means can be devised, within the constitutional and democratic framework, of giving representatives of the minority as well as of the majority community in Northern Ireland an active and permanent role, guaranteed by the United Kingdom Government, in the processes of government and administration in the Province.

SECRET 
PUBLIC SECURITY The meeting first discussed the security situation. Internment 
The Prime Minister asked Mr Faulkner for his opinion on the effect of internment on the minority community. 
MR FAULKNER said that the reaction 
of the minority community was not to be judged solely by reference to the violence that had accompanied the arrests, part of which was attributable to earlier events. 
Many members of the minority community would be relieved at the removal of IRA terrorists from their midst. The arrests 
had brought a dramatic reduction in the number of attacks on property by explosives, and the IRA in Belfast were, temporarily at any rate, seriously disorganised. 
The Border 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that any reduction in the intensity of terrorist activity in the towns would enable the Army to give greater attention to the Border; and he had instructed the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Northern Ireland, to review the studies h had previously ade on the protection of the Border with particular attention to the possibility of making unapproved roads impassable. 
MR FAULKNER agreed it was important to consider how greater attention could be given to the Border. 
No co-operation had been forthcoming, according 
to his information, from the regular army or police of the Irish Republic. He asked what progress had been made over considering the possibility of constituting a full-time unit of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). 
UDR 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, while a full-time unit of the UDR (which would require legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament) would bring some military advantage and relieve pressure on the regular Army, the Opposition at Westminster had set their face against it and it was strongly opposed by the minority in Northern Ireland. 
The apprehensions of its possible misuse at some future time was irrational, but to press forward

with the formation of a full-time unit in the face of these apprehensions would endanger support for the UDR in its present form. 
Government were, therefore, at present inclined against the proposal. Complaints of Ill-treatment 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if support for the policies of the 2 Governments over internment was to be sustained in Great Britain, it was necessary to find a means to refute mischievous suggestions of deliberate brutality on the part of the security forces. 
Merely to rely on the undertaking of the 
GOC that any allegations substantiated by evidence would be investigated was ceasing to be a tenable position. A formal inquiry was inappropriate, but the suggestion, put forward in a leading article in "The Guardian" that day, that a lawyer and a doctor from Great Britain should carry out an informal investigation of complaints had much to commend it. There might also be advantage if some independent observers were invited to inspect the internment camp now approaching completion at Long Kesh before it was occupied. It was also important that prompt action should be taken to set up the advisory committee for hearing representations against internment orders. 
MR FAULKNER said that the complaints of brutality tended to centre on the action of the security forces in making the initial arrests and on the treatment of detainees in the Army’s temporary holding camps. He supported the suggestions for an informal investigation of complaints of ill-treatment and for inspection of Long Kesh. He added that there might be merit in enabling such an organisation as Amnesty International to satisfy itself over the justice of the proceedings of the advisory committee. As to the committee itself, he was in process of setting it up and had invited Judge Brown, a Northern Ireland county court judge, to preside. The apparatus of the committee would not be required until internment orders (as opposed to detention orders) had been made. 
Allegations of vindictiveness THE PRIME MINISTER said that some action should be taken to refute suggestions that detention orders had been made out of mere political vindictiveness: for example by publishing a general description of those held in order to indicate their close involvement in terrorist activity.

MR FAULKNER said that the view of the security forces was that it would be untimely to publish such a description, which might prejudice their chances of success in arresting the remainder of the persons whose detention was sought. But he agreed that the matter should be reconsidered. 
Interrogation and further Arrests 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important that the momentum of interrogation should be maintained and that the remaining persons whose detention was sought should be arrested as soon as possible. 
MR FAULKNER said that there had been a pause in the progress of interrogation to analyse the results so far obtained, but he would impress the need for urgency on the Chief Constable. 
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that the review of the studies on the protection of the Border should be urgently pursued by the Secretary of State for Defence. The possibility of sending a lawyer and a doctor to conduct informal investigations of complaints should be urgently examined and the GOC should be consulted immediately. It would be important to select people who could fairly distinguish between deliberate brutality and the force that had inevitably to be used to bring violent terrorists into custody. The possibility of an independent inspection of the internment camp and the independent observation of the advisory committee system would also be pursued (although the International Red Cross might prove to be a more suitable body than Amnesty International for the latter purpose). The possibility of refuting allegations of vindictiveness in making arrests would be pursued. Information should be obtained on the timing of the plans for making further arrests, which, with the interrogation of those in custody, should be carried forward as quickly as possible. 
Relations with the Irish Republic The meeting then considered relations with the Irish Republic.

These objectives should probably include greater co-operation between Republican and Northern Ireland security forces along the border, stiffening the courts in the Republic, and the introduction of internment in the Republic (though it was thought that Mr. Lynch was unlikely to agree to the last of these proposals unless the IRA began to direct its action against the Republican Government). There might be other objectives to be sought in conversations with r. Lynch in the field of economic and social co-operation; and there might be much to be said

Current situation The internment operation has been a considerable success technically 
Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady wings of the IRA. The evidence is that both wings have been much more seriously disrupted than statements from IRA sources suggest, and while they will undoubtedly continue to give trouble, there is reasonable hope that, with increased vigilance at the border, terrorist activity wi11 now be at a lower level than in the weeks before internment. 2. 
But internment is only a means to an end: and the political and social consequences have been serious - more serious than many people Is 
Northern Ireland expected. It is too soon to reach conclusions about the permanence of public reaction, but there has undoubtedly been a greater polarisation between the two communities. 3. 
The reaction on the part of the minority to the decision to ban the 
marches, starting with the Apprentice Boys, has been disappointing. We have not done well in the propaganda battle, and the impression has bees widely given that the Army’s role has changed and that it is now there to maintain the dominance of the Unionist majority and to concentrate its attentions on the Roman Catholic minority. 4. 
The morale of moderate Roan Catholics is low and many of those who 
have been giving service to public bodies are wondering whether they can carry on. So far, there has been little response to the civil rights call for strikes, except in Londonderry, and the trade union leadership is trying to counter it. But it will be touch and go; and industrialists are becoming increasingly worried. There is a danger that the recent call for civil disobedience, now officially endorsed by the opposition and supported

by Mr.Lynch, will make a strong appeal to the minority. It could create a serious situation and may express itself in demonstrations on the streets. 5. 
The opposition at Stormont are removing themselves even further from 
the area of negotiation. It is a crucial political need to bring them back into Parliament, but they must now be very near the point of no return. The line they are now taking, and which Mr.Lynch is supporting, is that they want Stormont dismantled. Even the inclusion of opposition members in the Government in some form of coalition, which goes far beyond anything that Mr.Faulkner could agree to, might not now satisfy them. The problem 6. 
This has been written about endlessly. But the present predicament 
can be stated fairly simply. Mr.Faulkner has made what he regards as a number of heroic proposals, but feels that he cannot carry his party any further, particularly if by so doing it looks as though he would be making concessions to Mr.Lynch and the irresponsible reactions of the opposition. The opposition for their part have taken up such an extreme line that they are going to find it difficult to return to Stormont on anything like Mr.Faulkner’s terms without losing credibility, and are posing requirements which it is impossible for Mr.Faulkner to meet. Mr.Lynch,by throwing the weight of his government against the continued existence of Stormont, has stiffened the attitude of the Unionist leaders. And the fact remains that, if Mr.Faulkner were to go, there is no alternative to direct rule in sight. 7. 
First, our ordinary democratic processes do not work there. Our electoral arrangements are based on the doctrine "winner takes all". This is all right if each side wins from time to time. In Northern Ireland, however, these arrangements invariably produce a majority for the same party, and the opposition has no prospect of ever enjoying power. 50 years of perpetual opposition, with the prospects of this continuing indefinitely, 
Behind all this are the two under-lying problems of Northern Ireland.

a headache to add to his other problems; and it would be embarrassing for him, following what he has said about Northern Ireland, if in a united Ireland he were faced with a bid for a 50:50 sharing of power with the Protestant minority. 20. 
It looks as though the issues for consideration are as follows: (a) should we in effect do nothing for the time being, or at the most put out a statement on the lines of annex B, and wait and see, first, whether the present measures reduce the violence and the tension, and, then, what happens in October? 
(b) Or do the risks involved - the likelihood of attitudes 
hardening further by October, the strain of the bilateral agreement with the Westminster Opposition, the timing of the Lynch visit, and the probability of increasing restiveness in public opinion here and abroad - rule out this course and make it imperative to take some action in the near future? 
(c) If so, what form should this action take? Should Mr.Faulkner be pressed to agree to a statement about discussions under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary? Or should there be an announcement of a fairly early Ministerial visit to Northern Ireland for discussions with all sides, but without stating in detail the subjects to be covered?

Draft Statement Political Progress can only be impeded so long as violence and 
intimidation continue; and the purpose of internment, and of the Army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. The Border is not at issue. Nor is the constitutional position of 
Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Mr.Faulkner has already given details of the major reform programme 
which is in course of being carried through. This programme, to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr.Faulkner’s recent initiative, have pointed the way forward. Once peace and order are restored, the Home Secretary, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, has it in mind to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament; the purpose of these joint discussions will be to see whether it is possible, within this democratic framework, to devise further ways and means of giving representatives of the minority, as well as of the majority community in Northern Ireland, an active and permanent role in the processes of government and administration in the Province. In this way, further progress should be possible in creating a society in Northern Ireland acceptable to members of all communities.

MY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TELEGRAM: FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF RE-DRAFT: 1. 
Political progress can only be impeded so long as 
violence and intimidation continue: and the purpose of internment, and of the army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. 2.

Mr. Faulkner has already given details of the major reform 
programme which is in course of being carried through. This programme, to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr. Faulkner’s recent initiative, has pointed the way forward. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have today held a wide-ranging discussion with Mr. Faulkner, with particular emphasis on the implications of his speech of 22 June, and of the ref programme, for the greater participation of representatives of the minority in the processes of government and administration in the province. They are satisfied that conditions exist for real progress to be made. The debate which is to take place in the Northern Ireland parliament when it resumes after the recess will be of great importance to Northern Ireland and to the UK Parliament. It may well lead to proposals that will require legislation in Westminster amending the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It is therefore essential, in view of Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, that members from all sections of opinion

that your remarks have made much 
more difficult the task of all of us who want to see people of both communities in Northern Ireland sharing the benefits and undertaking some of the responsibilities of an ordered society, and can only strengthen the hand of the extremists. We must bring violence to an end, and internment has been introduced only as a means of achieving this. You have yourself recognised on occasion that it is a necessary means to an end in certain circumstances. The real need is the full participation of the minority community in the public life of Northern Ireland and I am anxious that they should take advantage of the opportunities now open to them to do so. I would hope that your influence could be brought to bear in this direction by recognising that these opportunities now exist. I would hope too that you should give credit to Stormont for introducing them; they are hardly the mark of a repressive Government. I am writing to you very frankly. It is not my present 
intention to make any statement in reply to your own, because I believe that a public argument between our two governments will only delay a solution.

3. The Secretary of State for Defence drew attention to recent articles 
in The Times and the Daily Mail involving interviews with IRA leaders and to the objectionable character of these interviews. It was agreed that whether or not in any particular instance such interviews could be made the subject of criminal proceedings, it might be advantageous to draw this practice to the attention of Lord Goodman the Chairman of the Newspaper Proprietors’ Association and of the Chairmen of the BBC and ITA. The Prime Minister said he would consider this. 
4. The Secretary of State for Defence referred to a report which he had 
received to the effect that the RUC having interrogated 12 detainees had an 
desisted from further interrogation in order that/analysis could be made of the results, and that military officers who had been assigned to assist the RUC over interrogation had been stood down. 
He suspected that this check 
to the momentum of interrogation was the result of political pressure. After discus sion the Prime Minister gave instructions for a telegram to the sent to the United Kingdom Representative in Belfast instructing him to raise the matter with Mr. Faulkner immediately with a view to the full momentum of interrogation being resumed. 
Later in the evening I telephoned the United Kingdom Representative 
who told me that he had already raised the matter with the General Officer Commanding and that he had expressed satisfaction with the arrangements as they were now working. There appeared to be no question of any political interference. What had been done had been done deliberately for professional reasons.

1. IF THE RADIO CORRECTLY REPORTS GERRY FITT AS SAYING 
THAT THE SIGNING OF INTERNMENT ORDERS PUTS AND END TO ANY PROSPECT OF SDLP PARTICIPATION IN TALKS THE FOLLOWING COMMENT IS PERHAPS NOT VERY IMPORTANT. 
BUT IN CASE THERE 
SHOULD BE FURTHER EXCHANGES WITH HIM IN HOSPITAL I MUST REPEAT THE VIEW STATED IN MY TEL NO 15 TO THE FCO THAT WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET TOO MUCH INVOLVED IN MANOEUVERINGS BETWEEN HIM AND THE OTHER SDLP MEMBERS: STILL LESS TO APPEAR TO BE TAKING INITIATIVES WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS SETTING ONE MEMBER AGAINST ANOTHER.) FROM SOME OF THE THINGS FITT SAID TO EVANS I FEAR HE IS SADLY OUT OF TOUCH. 
HIS CONFIDENCE IN PADDY DEVLIN 
(WHO DISLIKES HIM) AND IVAN COOPER ( WHO PROBABLY DISLIKES EVERYBODY) IS NOT TO BE RELIED UPON. 
THE SUGGESTION 
THAT HUME IS LESS OPPOSED TO VIOLENCE THAN THE OTHERS IS VERY MUCH OPEN TO QUESTION. 
THE SENDING OF A PERSONAL MESSAGE 
TO CONWAY ASKING HIM TO BRING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON HUME TO ALIGN HIMSELF WITH FITT IS. LITTLE SHORT OF LUNATIC. SINCE I DO NOT RATE FITT’S DISCRETION ANY HIGHER THAN HIS JUDGMENT I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT GIVING ADVICE OF THE KIND REPORTED IN PARA 5 OF YOUR TEL UNDER REFERENCE. 
I DO NOT THINK THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH 
THE ADVICE WAS GIVEN WERE SOUND ONES,EG. THAT IT IS A LIKELY CASE THAT HUME WOULD BE ON ONE SIDE WITH ALL THE REST ON THE OTHER: AND SINCE IF WE ARE IN THE END GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS COUNTRY WE SHALL NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH THE SDLP I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD HELP FOR 
THEM TO DISCOVER THAT WE WERE ENGAGING EITHER HERE OR IN DUBLIN, IN THEIR INTERNAL PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

STATEMENT BY MR. FAULKNER 
Since 9th August persons have been detained under Orders made by me as Civil Authority under the Special Powers Act. 
I have now made Orders interning 219 of these persons. Other detainees have been released 
on the direction of the Atto rney-General, or their cases are still under consideration. In view of the widespread and proper concern over the use by the 
Government of internment powers, I think it is my duty to explain fully the considerations I have borne in mind in making Internment Orders. We are at present engaged in a deadly struggle against an armed 
conspiracy whose immediate purpose it is to destroy the peace, stability and security of this part of the United Kingdom. 
I say the immediate purpose. The ultimate purpose is the overthrow by violence the clear and 
democratically expressed wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. 
Neither the I.R.A., nor 
indeed any other organisation, will be allowed to achieve this by force of arms, though the present campaign of violence may have gained the support of some, who while professing to deplore the methods of the I.R.A., are in sympathy with its aims. The leaders of this campaign are using every technique available to 
bypass the ordinary processes of democracy and to over-ride the wishes of the great majority of law-abiding citizens. 
The Northern Ireland Government 
is fully committed to and has taken effective steps to implement the principle of securing for the minority here the fullest possible opportunity to participate in the running of affairs within the framework of democratic government. The danger of not taking firm measures to defeat the I.R.A. lies precisely in 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 480\\IMG_5589_PREM_15_480 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]
Reference 1 - 50.00% Coverage
Page 1 : (0,0) - (620,846)
Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
in the fact that those who use or advocate violence destroy the prospects of peaceful co-operation in this direction. Let us by clear that the I.R.A. have already deprived the community 
in Northern Ireland of certain elementary rights. People in areas where the I.R.A. is most active have been ruthlessly intimidated. those areas fear daily the risk of bring struck down. People outside A government as the 
same duty to protect its citizens from an internal enemy as it has to protect them from an external enemy in time of war and those who oppose the rights of the individual should also consider the rights of society as a whole. I have exercised powers of internment with the greatest possible 
reluctance, a reluctance shared by all my colleagues as well as by Her Majesty’s Government in London. 
But I have made no Internment Order without 
being satisfied on evidence placed before me that the person concerned was and still is an active member of the Official or Provisional Wing of the I.R.A. or has been closely implicated in the recent I.R.A. campaign. 
Amongst those 
now interned are over 80 officers of the Official and Provisional Wing of the I.R.A. 
political views or because oppose the Government. Persons who may be members of the Civil Rights 
Movement or the People’s Democracy, or of other organisation, are being interned only if they are also members of the I.R.A. or actively involved in it. 
Members of various organisations who have been associated in one way or 
another with the I.R.A. are not included where I am not satisfied that they are sufficiently deeply implicated and committed to violence to justify their being interned. 
as before within the limits of the law. 
Anyone in Northern Ireland is as free to express his views The only reason anyone is interned 
is that he belongs to, and has actively supported, an organisation which advocated and uses violence for political ends.

Internment is not appropriate in the case of those people who 
may have been guilty of indiscriminate or malicious violence, and I am satisfied that the ordinary processes of law are sufficient to deal with the great majority of them. Why then should the same processes of law not have their way with 
members of the I.R.A.? In many cases, of course, the law has caught up 
with them and about 40 members of the organisation are at present serving prison sentences, but they represent only a small proportion of membership and further steps had to be taken. 
When one is dealing with an armed 
conspiracy it may be necessary to take pre-emptive action rather than wait until those involved can be caught red-handed. 
When I.R.A. groups emerge 
from concealment for an attack the security forces are always in a position to engage or capture and if open confrontation occurs there is always, as we know, an appalling risk of innocent people being injured or killed. There comes a stage when a government cannot afford to wait until known terrorists choose the moment to strike. 
Furthermore, intimidation had made 
it more and more difficult to get witnesses to give evidence against members of the I.R.A. 
It was clearly intolerable that they should be able any 
longer by this means to place themselves effectively beyond the law. It is alleged that internment is being directed against the Catholic 
section of the population. This is simply untrue. It is directed against 
an unlawful and ruthless association, whose clear aim it is to overthrow by force of arms the constitution and laws of Northern Ireland. Internment involves the Catholic community only to the extent that 
some, I say some, member of that community have become involved in I.R.A. activity.

It is also claimed that in order to be seen to be impartial the 
Government should proceed to intern criminal elements of the Protestant community. 
There are criminals in both communities who may have 
committed serious offences during the disturbances of recent years. They are subject to the same rigours of the law as any other criminal and many so-called extreme Protestants are at present serving heavy sentences. Others who may have taken part in recent disturbances will be brought to justice when they have been identified and the facts investigated. 
I 
repeat that internment is being confined to members of unlawful associations committed to violence against whom the ordinary law has, in present circumstances, proved ineffective. The Special Powers Regulations provide for the setting up of an 
Advisory Committee to consider representations from internees. His Honour 
Judge Brown has agreed to act as Chairman of this Committee. It will be open to any internee, and all have been informed of their 
rights, to put his case to the Committee, verbally or in writing, or by both means. 
If he wishes to have legal advice in submitting a written case 
he may do so and the Government has arranged that financial arrangements similar to those available under the legal aid scheme will be applicable. The Committee’s main function will be to assess whether or when the internee’s release can be safely permitted, and much will depend on whether or not they can accept any undertaking on his part that he will not engage in violence on his release. 
The Committee will make their recommendations to the Minister of Home Affairs.

It is not the Government’s intention that anyone should be kept in a day longer than is necessary. How long anyone will be interned 
will depend on two factors; namely, the credibility of any undertaking an individual may give as to his future behaviour if he were to be released in advance of any general release, and in the other cases, the restoration of normal law and order in the community. I should add the warning that so long as the present situation 
prevails it will be necessary for the protection of decent people that the present policy be pursued. 
This means that the relentless pursuit 
of those members of the I.R.A. still on the wanted list will continue. The Government has introduced internment solely for the protection 
of the citizens of Northern Ireland. I hope, therefore, that those who, 
for reasons which I respect, are opposed to internment whatever the circumstances will also use their influence to bring to an end the conditions which have made internment necessary. 
The return to normal conditions 
will mean not only the release of internees but also the restoration to the community at large of the right to a quiet and peaceful life which the campaign of the terrorists is denying them.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT THE HOME OFFICE ON MONDAY, 13TH SEPTEMBER 
Present: 
Home Secretary Mr. Waddell 
Mr. Woodfield Mr. Angel 
Mr. Hockaday (Ministry of Defence) Mr. K. White (Foreign Office) 
Mr. P. Gregson(Prime Minister’s Office) 
Tripartite Talks The Home Secretary said that public opinion would become impatient 
with demands from Mr. Lynch or Mr. Faulkner for pre-conditions for sitting down with the Prime Minister. 
The United Kingdom Government’s position 
should be that all three parties have well-known public positions which they have not abandoned by agreeing to participate in talks, but which should not prevent them from talking together. 
It was agreed that Sir Burke Trend 
should speak to Sir Harold Black to agree the revised date for the talks, 27th/28th September, and to urge in the Prime Minister’s name that in the meantime it would be best not to mako public statements about the basis on which the talks were to be held. Interment Mr. Woodfield reported that in his visit to Belfast on Friday, 10th 
September, he had found that the Internment Orders submitted for Mr. Faulkner’s signature contained only the briefest references to the grounds for internment and were not accompanied by supporting evidence. 
Each Order gave the reason 
for internment, which ranged from stating that the person concerned was a known members of the I.R.A., to stating that he was believed to be a member of the I.R.A. 
Mr. Woodfield had told Mr. Faulkner that there should be grounds 
on the face of each Order which Mr. Faulkner signed to justify internment. It was not sufficient that there might be evidence elsewhere. 
It was also

desirable that there should be no reference on the order to grounds not connected with terrorism, such as allegations that the person concerned had stirred up anti-Northern Ireland Government feeling. 
Mr. Woodfield 
had indicated to officials that a United Kingdom Minister would not be prepared to act on the basis of the information which he had seen. It was admitted that the exercise had not been very well prepared. 
It appeared 
that only 12-20 of the people at present detained would be released when Internment Orders were made. Mr. Faulkner had two of the three members for the Advisory Committee 
Judge Brown, a County Court Judge in Northern Ireland, and a businessman. The Lord Chancellor’s Office had reluctantly suggested names for an English lawyer, but it was difficult to find a Q.C. who was prepared to serve under a Northern Ireland County Court Judge. 
The Northern Ireland Government 
intended to keep all the activities of the Advisory Committee secret so that it would not be known who had appealed and what the results of the appeals would be. 
Mr. Woodfield had told them that this would not be acceptable. The Home Secretary said that it would not be practicable to delay 
signing Internment Orders until after the tripartite talks on 27th/28th September. 
a right of appeal. Until the Orders were signed none of those concerned would have It should be agreed that Mr. Faulkner should aim to sign the Orders in the middle of this week. The United Kingdom Government’s 
position should be that all reasonable people agreed that those actively associated with terrorism should be locked up. 
The United Kingdom Government 
would prefer to use the normal processes of law for this purpose, but the situation in Northern Ireland made this impracticable. 
As internment had 
been resorted to it was right to give all those confined access to the Appeal Tribunal. 
Internment Orders were therefore being made against all who were alleged to be actively associated with the I.R.A. Anyone who contested this

FROM ROBERTS 10 DOWNING STREET PLEASE PASS FOLLOWING MESSAGE TO ARMSTRONG IN PRIME MINISTER’S 
DURING THE PRIME MINISTERS CONVERSATION WITH MR FAULKNER A MISUNDERSTANDING AROSE ABOUT INTERNMENT. THE POSITION IS THAT WOODFIELD WAS IN BELFAST TODAY TO PERSUADE FAULKNER NOT TO SIGN THE INTERNMENT CERTIFICATES OVER THE WEEKEND, AND CERTAINLY NOT UNTIL MEMBERSHIP OF THE APPEALS TRIBUNAL HAD BEEN COMPLETED. IT WAS ONLY AFTER WOODFIELD HAD FINISHED HIS MEETINGS IN BELFAST THAT THE HOME SECRETARY MOVED A STAGE FURTHER AND DECIDED THAT THE RIGHT COURSE WAS FOR THE CERTIFICATES NOT TO BE SIGNED UNTIL AFTER THE LYNCH MEETING. IT WAS THIS POSITION WHICH I REPORTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER AT 7 PM. THIS EVENING. AS THE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID TO FAULKNER THAT HE GATHERED THAT WOODFIELD HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH FAULKNER AND THAT HE (THE PRIME MINISTER) HAD HAD ’’A MESSAGE FROM THE HOME SECRETARY TO THAT EFFECT SUGGESTING" THAT INTERNMENT CERTIFICATES SHOULD NOT BE SIGNED UNTIL AFTER THE LYNCH TALKS. FAULKNER INTERPRETED THIS AS MEANING THAT WOODFIELD HAD SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD NOT PROCEED WITH INTERNMENT UNTIL AFTER THE TALKS: AND POINTED OUT (CORRECTLY) 
THAT THIS WAS NOT THE POSITION DISCUSSED 
WITH WOODFIELD. IT IS STILL THE VIEW OF BURKE AND WADDELL (TO WHOM I HAVE EXPLAINED HOW THE MISUNDERSTANDING AROSE) THAT WE SHOULD NOT GO FURTHER ON INTERNMENT BEFORE THE LYNCH TALKS. WADDELL WILL BE REPORTING TO THE HOME SECRETARY, WHO MAY WELL TRY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OVER THE WEEKEND TO SUGGEST A FURTHER APPROACH TO FAULKNER. THERE IS, I THINK, NO DANGER THAT THE INTERNMENT CERTIFICATES WILL BE SIGNED BEFORE MONDAY AT THE EARLIEST, BUT ALL CONCERNED ARE AWARE OF THE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY. MESSAGE ENDS.

HONIP(71) 35 3 September 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 27 AUGUST-2 SEPTEMBER 1971 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
Belfast continues and many other areas in Northern Ireland have suffered from this form of attack during the period. 
The large number and heavy weight of explosions occurring in There have 
also been many incidents of shooting at members of the security forces and while most have failed to find their target, two soldiers and one member of the UDR have died from gunshots. 
There continues 
to be comparatively little street activity in Northern Ireland and there have been no reports of trouble arising from meetings to protest at internment and to support civil disobedience. 
These 
meetings have not always been well attended, particularly in Belfast. Mr Heath’s meeting with Mr Lynch on 6 and 7 September has been generally welcomed but there is no sign that the parliamentary opposition is preparing to take a less intransigent position. 
There 
are signs that Protestant criticism of the security situation is growing. 
SECURITY SITUATION 2. 
The situation in Belfast has encompassed explosions, armed robberies, shooting incidents and isolated street disorder. 
Targets 
for bomb attacks included a customs house, shops, commercial offices, electricity equipment, a church hall, a club and a petrol station. In recent months this type of property has become a regular target. More unusually, explosions on 2 September occurred in Belfast’s city centre injuring about 54 people. condemnation from Mr Lynch. 
This incident drew a strong He expressed sympathy to the families 
of those who had died in such incidents and to those who were injured. One of the explosions occurred at the Unionist Party’s headquarters where a bomb failed to explode on 19 August (see HONIP(71) 33 page 1). About £2,500 was stolen in four armed robberies in Belfast on 27 August and a further £200 was stolen on 28 August. 
The first 
shooting incident in Belfast of the period occurred on 29 August when a soldier, Gunner Loring, was shot while at an Army checkpoint. died on 31 August.

A mine exploded by an Army patrol on 30 August, On 31 August 
shots were fired on two occasions at the Army post in Albert Street mill and on four different occasions at Army patrols in various parts of the city. 
Some of the fire was

Most newspaper commentators noted anomalous points in Mr Lynch’s version, but reported that the incident was not going to be allowed to develop into a major diplomatic row. 
7. On 1 September it was announced that Mr Lynch had accepted an 
invitation from Mr Heath for talks at Chequers on 6 and 7 September. It was explained that the invitation had come well before the border incident. 
The meeting arranged for 20 to 21 October will 
not now take place although the statement from Dublin said that it was intended that there should be a further meeting later in the year.

further details about the inquiry into allegations of brutality by the British Army (see HONIP(71) paragraph 8). 
A more hostile reception was accorded to the announcement of Its chairman was 
named as Sir Edmund Compton, the former Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) in Westminster who still holds this position at Stormont. 
the Recorder of Plymouth and Dr Ronald Gibson, former chairman of the Council of the British Medical Association. 
He is to be assisted by Mr Edgar Fay QC, Their terms of 
reference are:- "To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9 August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". 
The Home Secretary said that 
the inquiry should take place in private to ensure the personal safety of those attending it and their families and that the two sides should not meet while giving evidence. 
Each individual 
should be heard alone without legal or other representation. The inquiry has no statutory power to require the production of records or the attendance of witnesses or to take evidence on oath. 
It was announced that a copy of their report will be 
published. 9. 
These terms of reference have attracted criticism from 
Opposition groups in Northern Ireland, including Miss Bernadette Devlin MP, Mr McAteer, President of the Nationalist Party and the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. 
Crumlin Road jail are reported to have announced their intention to boycott the inquiry. 
they were prepared to rely entirely on statements published in the press about alleged brutality. 
10. Representatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party were at a series of separate meetings in London on 1 September called by the British Labour Party. 
Also present were 
representatives of the Irish Republic’s Labour Party and the Northern Ireland Labour Party. 
An agreed statement said that 
there could be no realistic solution without an end of internment and the release of those detained and announced the early establishment of a commission of inquiry, representative of all the parties, which would visit Northern Ireland and examine proposals for a political solution. 
11. Mr Austin Currie, an MP of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, told a rally in Keady, County Armagh on 31 August that the Party would not enter into any negotiations with anyone in 
Detainees at Belfast’s Sir Edmund Compton said that if necessary The announcement was welcomed by the Social Democratic and

government while anyone was detained or interned. Furthermore, he said, the party was only prepared to negotiate on the basis of the suspension of Stormont, the appointment of a commission and quadripartite talks between Westminster, Dublin, Unionists and nonUnionists. Earlier in the week the Social Democratic and Labour Party had endorsed a further phase of their campaign when they asked people in the Irish Republic not to buy British goods. There is little evidence, even in the Irish papers, that this call has met with much response. No doubt in an attempt to keep up enthusiasm for a campaign of civil disobedience and further translate it into firm practical action, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association announced that the 5 to 11 September would be a week of protest in Northern Ireland with rallies in each county culminating in a "major rally" on 12 September in Belfast. The association had been addressed by Social Democratic and Labour Party MPs, Mr Currie and Mr Devlin. 
12. There have been increasing reports of statements on the 
security situation and how it could be improved from many shades of Protestantism in Northern Ireland. Mr Taylor the Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs reacting to the Crossmaglen border incident said in an interview that border roads might now have to be blown up to prevent illegal crossings from the Irish Republic. There were not enough men available to patrol the border he said, since the days when the "B Specials" mustered 12,000 men for this work. Among other alternatives for border security he mentioned the possibility of a third force augmenting the Army and the RUC. One report commented that it was later emphasised that he was speaking personally. Rather more extreme measures were conjured up by a report that a register of people willing to form a reconstructed Ulster Special Constabulary (B Specials) was to be drawn up. A secret meeting of the Belfast branch of the Ulster Special Constabulary Association comprising ex-B Specials, was announced for 3rd September to co-ordinate this. Mr. Craig, in a radio interview on 31 August pointed out that ex-B Specials would only hold themselves ready for action initiated by the Government and not break the law themselves. Mr. John McQuade Unionist MP and fellow member of the newly formed "Loyalist Alliance" (HONIP(71) 33 page 3) is reported to have said that he would use a gun "to defend my people". 
STATEMENTS FROM THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 13. 
The Pope issued a message referring to Northern Ireland when he 
addressed pilgrims at his summer residence on 29 August. He said that the situation in Northern Ireland had recently grown worse "and was then further aggravated following the adoption of exceptional security measures which were strongly resented by at least part of the citizens". He promised his prayer for those who sought a peaceful and just solution, and hoped that the people would be united by their common Christian belief to exercise "mutual understanding and reciprocal collaboration". In mentioning, by implication, detention, some saw the statement as commenting adversely on it.

called on 31 August for an end to violence. He recognised that responsibility for the present suffering, misery and death was shared "by those who neglected to remedy or who turned a blind eye 
INTERVIEW WITH MR WEST 15. 
Mr West, the Minister for Agriculture and the most right wing 
member of Mr Faulkner’s Cabinet, said in a radio interview on 29 August that he was satisfied with Mr Faulkner’s policies at the moment. He thought Mr Paisley had recently made errors of judgement which had reduced Mr Paisley’s support. He spoke harshly both of Mr Lynch, whose attempts at interference he deplored and of Mr Wilson for his statements on internment (see HONIP(71) 34 paragraph 2). He also said he would oppose any move for allowing what he described as declared enemies of the constitution to sit in the Cabinet. He was clearly referring to some of the more radical suggestions for increasing non-Unionist participation in Government. 
REFUSALS OF ENTRY TO EXTREMISTS 16. 
Mr Rory Brady, widely recognised as the leader of the 
Provisional faction of the IRA although he admits only to leading the political wing of the Provisional movement (Sinn Fein) was refused entry to England and returned to the Irish Republic on 28 August. Newspapers reported that it was decided that no criminal charges could be brought against him and he was returned on the grounds that his presence was not in the interests of national security. 
17. Mr Joe Cahill (see HONIP(71) 33 page 3) was held on his 
arrival in New York to start a fund-raising tour. He was refused permission to enter the United States of America; his appeal to stay was adjourned until 7 September.

Extract from THE WORLD AT ONE Philip Whitfield/ord-Chalfont 
TRANSMISSION: 30th August 1971 CHALFOnT: 
As a result of the policy of detention and 
presumably internment will follow, the IRA, the groups, units, in the Belfast area have been badly broken up, and many of them have had to go into the Republic of Ireland where of course they are given complete freedom by the authorities down there, to operate, to train, and to move about arms and gelignite, and therefore one is very likely to have an increasing number of incidents along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. We had an incident last night at Clogher on the Tyrone/Monaghan border, and we had one at Koleen, near Newry, and of course we had this dastardly murder by IRA groups based in the Republic of Ireland near Corfmaglen. 
WHITFIELD: Yes, well given the nature of the border with 
minor roads criss-crossing backwards and forwards over it, surely it was inevitable that the army would inadvertently stray into the Republic, as they did at Corfmaglen? 
CHALFONT: Yes. Unfortunately this will happen with the 
army, I suspect, from time to time, because unlike the previous occasion of 1956/60 when the Ulster Special Constabulary were responsible for security along the order, there were 
who used every lane 
and every road and every river, and they knew exactly when they wore in Northern Ireland and when they weren’t. 
WHITFIELD: The physical nature of the border makes it 
very difficult to patrol. I mean surely from Derry to Newry it’s wild moorland, and then you’ve got situations like in the village of .. whore the border itself runs through a man’s bedroom. How on earth can those be controlled? 
CHALFONT: Well, I’m not suggesting they patrol men’s 
bedrooms, but what I am saying is that if we had the manpower, and there were men with local knowledge, w could once again show that this border could be patrolled much more effectively than at present. 
WHITFIELD: You would presumably blow up unapproved roads, 
would you, as you did in the fifties? CHALFONT 
Yes, you have two alternatives. You can put 
spikes into the road, but they’re reasonably ineffective because they can be pulled out. The alternative is to blow up river bridges and culverts, and this was done in 1956 and proved quite effective at that time. There are about 150 roads which cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and if the Southern Irish authorities fail to take any initiative to clamp down on the IRA activities in the South of Ireland, then I would have thought it must be necessary for we in Northern Ireland

Extract from TH WORLD AT ON Philip Whitfield/Lord Chalfont 
TRANSMISSION: 30th August 1971 CHALFONT: 
As a result of the policy of detention and 
presumably internment will follow, the IrA, the groups, units, in the Belfast area have been badly broken up, and many of them have had to go into the Republic of Ireland where of course they are given complete freedom by the authorities down there, to operate, to train, and to move about arms and gelignite, and therefore one is very likely to have an increasing number of incidents along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. We had an incident last night at Clogher on the Tyrone/Monaghan border, and we had one at Koleen, near Newry, and of course we had this dastardly murder by IRA groups based in the Republic of Ireland near Corfmaglen. 
WHITFIELD: Yes, well given the nature of the border with 
minor roads criss-crossing backwards and forwards over it, surely it was inevitable that the army would inadvertently stray into the Republic, as they did at Corfmaglen? 
CHALFONT: Yes. Unfortunately this will happen with the 
army, I suspect, from time to time, because unlike the previous occasion of 1956/60 when the Ulster Special Constabulary were responsible for security along the border, there were local people who used every lane and every road and every river, and they knew exactly when they were in Northern Iroland and when they weren’t. 
WHITFIELD: The physical nature of the border makes it

to take action to restrict the number of routes which are left open across the border. 
WHITFIELD: Wasn’t the success of the operation in the 
fifties due to the co-operation of Devalera and the Irish Government. In the south, they. interned a hundred extremists as well and patrolled their side of the border. Now there is no sign of co-operation from Jack Lynch’s government at the moment. 
CHALFONT: No, this is true. We did have a responsible 
approach by the government authorities at that time, insofar as the IRA was concerned, but unfortunately on this occasion, Mr. Lynch’s government seems to be going out of its way to facilitate the IRA on the one hand and then on the second hand to say that it condemns violence. I find both actions inconsistent with each other.

report had been written essentially for peace-time conditions rather than for a situation of armed conflict such as obtained at present. LORD CARRINGTON agreed that this was the right view to take of the Hunt recommendations; he commented that he had certainly seen no policemen who were not armed when he visited Londonderry the previous day. 
2. The CLF explained that there were broadly speaking 
three categories of police stations to be considered: those in which the RUC and the Army both made use of the accommodation, other large or medium sized stations, and the small stations with only three or four policemen. There were 151 police stations altogether; at present the Army was providing protection for 72 of them, but he regarded this as entirely a temporary arrangement which 
- except in the case of the shared stations - should be ended as soon as 
possible. 3. 
LORD CARRINGTON made a brief survey of the present 
security situation. He was satisfied that the introduction of internment had been a major step forward in bringing the poison of terrorism to the surface; the task for the Security Forces was now one of cleaning up, which was bound to take quite a long time but which he was sure could be completed successfully provided that the political situation remained reasonably stable. In particular, internment had increased the amount of available information about the IRA and the Army’s main task was now to follow up this intelligence so that terrorists were given no respite. At the same time there were very real difficulties in providing sufficient Army manpower for this task 
- and it was really out of the 
question therefore to saddle the Army with widespread commitments to provide static guards as well. As for the UDR, he was reluctant to use its members on guarding police stations 
- partly because, so far at least, its strength was 
barely adequate for its other guard duties, but mainly because the idea that protecting police stations would be one of the regiment’s main tasks seemed likely to discourage would-be recruits. 
4. Members of the Police Authority then made the following 
points : a. 
They were strongly opposed to making the RUC responsible for guarding its own stations because this would aggravate the shortage of policemen available for proper police duties. The task of providing adequate protection at all police stations would call for something like 1,000 men. The force was already below strength by

TRIPARTITE TALKS ON NORTHERN IRELAND Chequers, 27 and 28 September 1971 
AGREED STATEMENT During the last two days we have discussed the situation in 
Northern Ireland in all its aspects. We have done so fully recog- 
nising that each of us remains committed to his publicly stated position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland; and we have been concerned to see whether, without prejudice to those positions, we can find some agreed means of enabling all the people of Northern Ireland to live in the conditions of peace and stability which any democracy should ensure to its citizens without regard to their religious or political conviction. 
We are at one in condemning any form of violence as an instrument 
of political pressure; and it is our common purpose to seek to bring violence, and internment and all other emergency measures to an end without delay. 
We also recognise that to bring violence quickly to an end and to 
resume economic, social and cultural progress means must be found to establish harmony and co-operation between the two communities in Northern Ireland. 
Our discussions in the last two days have helped to 
create an atmosphere of greater understanding between us and it is our hope that the process of political reconciliation may go forward to a successful outcome. 
We agree that our meeting has served a significant and useful 
purpose in present circumstances, and we believe that further such meetings may have a helpful part to play in the future. 
Mr. Heath and Mr. Lynch agreed to keep in close communication with 
each other, personally, through their ministerial colleagues and at official level, as might be appropriate, on all subjects affecting the future of Anglo-Irish relations. 
In this respect the meeting between 
the two Prime Ministers scheduled for the autumn to discuss a range of subjects, including the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the applications of both countries for membership of the European Communities will be held on dates to be announced later.

D/Min/RB/5 Pt 9 September, 1971 You wrote to Robert Andrew on 26th August asking whether 
more effective action could be taken by the security forces to deal with explosions. We delayed a reply because Lord Balniel intended to speak to the Prime Minister on 5th September about this, but in the event the topic was not raised. However, since then I understand that the CGS has explained the position to the Prime Minister. You have asked for a reply to keep on the record. 
Robert Andrew’s letter to you of 18th May set out various 
measures being taken to counter the use of explosives. Amongst these was the intention to set up explosive detection teams to attempt to trace the sources of the explosives used. These have been fully operational since June. 
We have discussed with Northern Ireland whether any further 
measures can be taken. The Army is stepping up its surveillance of vulnerable points with the specific object of trying to catch those responsible for placing bombs or explosives, even if the resulting explosions cannot be prevented. But of course the key to prevention is in good intelligence of the whereabouts of the terrorists’ illegal stocks of explosives and their intended targets; and in proper controls over distribution of legally held explosives. 
RUC Special Branch intelligence sources reduced considerably 
immediately after Internment was announced on 9th August, but have since improved again, and we hope we shall eventually get a lead to the prime sources of the explosives 
- and the bombers 
by interrogation. We are also working on the feasibility of arranging for all 
detonators manufactured in the UK in future to be marked indelibly with a concealed coding which would enable the source of any found in unexploded bombs to be traced. However, there 
are a number of difficulties in the way of a practicable scheme, and it would inevitably take some time before marked detonators began to find their way into the hands of the terrorists. There have been references to the possibility of this kind of approach in the press; but we are keen not to show our hands publicly before we are ready,both because of the practical difficulties and because of the risk that terrorists would be put on their guard and would lay in a stock of unmarked 
- detonators.

III. Next, agree that the issues for discussion can perhaps best be grouped 
under three heads:A. The scope and nature of further reforms 
B. - both constitutional and 
administrative - in Northern Ireland. The problem of security and public order. 
C. Internment. (This is put separately, and last, partly because it is in a sense the most difficult issue and partly because it bridges A and B, which are therefore beat discussed first). 
A . Further Reforms in Northern Ireland (1) Agree on the objective 
i.e. the need to ensure the minority 
communities ’an active, permanent and guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of the Province". (2) Agree that this entails both changes at Stormont and changes In administrative practice "on the ground"; and that these are the agenda for the Home Secretary’s discussions. (3) 
heads. I have emphasised to Sir Harold Black:- 
(1) That Mr. Faulkner should come prepared to be as explicit and detailed in this respect as Mr. Lynch wishes and that his proposals for administrative change appointments. etc. 
- particularly as regards public - may be particularly relevant. 
(ii) That the Green Paper is not to be published without our prior acquiescence in the timing of publication. 
(4) Invite Mr. Lynch to comment. If the Northern Ireland proposals 
are not enough, what more does he want? He will probably say that:(i) He wants to get rid of Stormont altogether and to substitute a system of government by Commission in which the two communities will be represented equally on a 50:50 basis. Both we and Mr. Faulkner will probably have to reply that this would not be democratic and that any system of Parliamentary democracy must operate on the basis that the will of the majority must prevail. To which Mr. Lynch will say that Ulster Is a unique problem, which requires unique treatment. At this point there may be deadlock. But it may be possible to restore movement by getting Mr. Faulkner to discuss the possibility of introducing sone Roman Catholics into his Cabinet provided that they are "sound" on the basic constitutional issue, i.e. provided that they are not Republicans. Although

Mr. Faulkner may also wish to discuss the "localisation" of 
(see Annex I of the brief) and the provision of armed guards at police stations (on which the Home Office are preparing a separate brief). Both of these points are for separate discussion with Mr. Faulkner, not for the tripartite meeting. C. 
the UDR 
Internment This may be the most difficult part of the discussion, since it 
represente the issue where Mr. Faulkner can least afford to give ground but Mr. Lynch may be most concerned to extract some concession as his price for supporting the Horne Secretary’s discussions (if he is otherwise prepared to do so). Begin by trying to get agreement that no democratic government can 
afford to give way to violence and that, if violence escalates to a certain pitch, there may be no alternative to some kind of internment policy. Then, try to get Mr. Faulkner to justify the way in which internment 
has been carried out and the treatment which has been given to the internees. (Some reference to the conditions at Long Kesh; the Red Cross inspection; the derogation under the European Convention on Human Rights, etc Back this up with an undertaking that the appeals procedure (due to 
begin on Saturday) will be conducted as rapidly as possible and will embrace all internees, whether they appeal or not. Play down the prospect of further internment. (In this connection I 
have told Sir Harold Black that, while we are not asking the Government of Northern Ireland to stop pulling people in, they should keep very quiet about the existence of a further list with as many as 200 names on it. 
Typically, 
he did not even know that the list existed!). The least unprofitable outcome of this part of the discussion would be 
an undertaking by Mr. Faulkner - ? which might be publicly quoted that internment will he Definitely brought to an end as soon as political stability is restored (unless criminal charges can be preferred in the normal way). If, in return for an undertaking of this kind, Mr. Lynch would publicly put his weight behind 
too badly. IV. 
the Home Secretary’s discussions, we should not have done By now the discussion may have reached the point at which it becomes 
possible to think in terms of a statement or communique. Sir Harold Black gave me this morning the attached draft which Mr. Faulkner may ask you to

this evening about the proposed visit to Long Kesh by the International Red Cross. 
You told me that the Prime Minister might like to say something We suggest that this might be along the lines that the 
Northern Ireland Government have said that they would welcome a visit to places of internment by the International Red Cross; that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has conveyed this invitation to Geneva; and that a team from the International Red Cross is expected to visit Northern Ireland in the near future. at about the end of the month. 
We think this is likely to be On the question of publication of the 
report of the visit, we understand that this would normally be published subject to the agreement of the country concerned. 
I understand that 
in this case, Stormont rather than Westminster would be the appropriate authority. 
You may like to know for your own information that representatives 
of the British Red Cross will be seeing officials at the Home Office tomorrow for an informal meeting aimed at providing us with information in preparation for the later visit by the International team. 
On another point, we have ascertained from Northern Ireland that 
the salary of the Parliamentary Commissioner is paid out of their Consolidated Fund. 
I understand that he did not receive anything from 
that source until 1st April 1971 (i.e. until after he had ceased to hold the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for the United Kingdom as a whole).

23rd September 1971 I am writing to record my conversation with 
Cummings in Mr. Faulkner’s office this morning about the request of a number of M.Ps. to visit the places of internment in Northern Ireland. 
Cummings told me that this had been discussed 
in the Joint Security Committee this morning in the context of the Northern Ireland Government’s invitation to the International Red Cross to visit places of internment, and bearing in mind their refusal so far to allow their own Members of Parliament to make a general inspection of places of internment as opposed to visiting individual constituents. Cummings said that they would very much prefer to receive one representative Parliamentary delegation rather than a series of groups of M.PS. 
He 
authorised us to say on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland that any request from Westminster M.Ps "would receive sympathetic consideration".

23rd September 1971 The Secretary of the Northern Ireland Detainees Enquiry telephoned 
this morning to say that Sir Edmund Compton was disturbed to hear of Mr. Thorpe’s reference to him during the debate yesterday as an employee of the Northern Ireland Government (Col. 53 of the Official Report). 
Sir 
Edmund has asked if a Government spokesman taking part in the debate today could use the following form of words to rebut this damaging statement:- 
"The chairman is not in the employment of either the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland Governments. 
His status as 
Parliamentary Commissioner is similar to that of a judge. The law governing his appointment ensures he is fully independent of Government with full powers to investigate, and if need be, criticise the actions of Government". 
I told the Secretary that I could by no means guarantee that this 
form of words would be used, but I would bring them to the attention of the Prime Minister. 
We have discovered a little detail about the three internees ment- 
ioned in the "Sunday Times" article quoted by the Leader of the Opposition in yesterday’s debate. 
I attach a note which reveals very little about 
the reasons for the three men being interned but does set at rest any anxiety about their physical condition. 
I attach a note about conditions at Long Kesh which I understand you 
have also asked for. Mr. Sydney Bidwell, M.P., Mr. William Molloy, M.P. and Mr. Arthur 
Latham, M.P. have asked the Home Secretary if it would be possible for them to visit Long Kesh on behalf of the "Labour Committee Against Internment in Northern Ireland". 
a number of other unspecified M.Ps. could also visit Long Kesh. know the results of my enquiries. Mr. Kevin McNamara has asked if he and Responsi- 
bility for this matter rests with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Northern Ireland. 
I will be in touch with them during the day and will let you J. G. PILLING Peter Gregson, Esq.

Home Secretary’s discussions may prepare the way fcr te reconciliation of the communities in Northern Ireland, we recognise that no political initiative of this kind can be expected to succeed in an atmosphere of declared hostility and open violence. We therefore call upon all the parties involved to abstain from provocation, whether by word or deed, while the Home Secretary’s discussions are in progress; and we have undertaken, each for his own Government, that in implementing our respective policies in relation to Northern Ireland we will intensify our efforts to restrain illegal violence, to uphold law and order and to protect human life and dignity. 
[Details, if possible, of what the 
Government of the Republic will offer in terms of further action. 
If they try to bargain this 
against some concession on internment, the following paragraph may help. 
It may be wise 
to include it in any event]. The introduction of internment in the Six 
Counties has been necessary only because no Government can acquiesce in illegal attempts to overthrow lawfully constituted authority or allow itself to be coerced by intimidation and bloodshed. 
But we all deplore the circumstances 
which have led to internment; /and we welcome the assurance of the Government of Northern Ireland that every effort will be made to ensure that all those who wish to avail themselves of their statutory right to appeal against their continued detention will be enabled to do so as rapidly as possible and that the number of those held in internment will be reduced to the minimum constituting an indisputable threat to public security].

THERE IS NO QUOTE APPROPRIATE ACTION UNQUOTE TO BE TAKEN IN DUBLIN TO PREVENT MISINTERPRETATION OF THE DETENTION ORDERS SAVE THE LINE WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN WITH TRUSTED CONTACTS, THAT THE 219 PERSONS CONCERNED ARE DIRECTLY OR CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE IRA. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY PUBLISHED LISTS, THESE CONTACTS ARE RELYING UPON FIGURES PROVIDE IN CONFIDENCE BY KEVIN STREET THAT SOME 160 OF THE 219 ARE IRA ACTIVISTS OF ONE FACTION OR THE OTHER. 
2. WITH NO MORE INFORMATION THAN MR FAULKNER’S STATEMENT ABOUT DETENTION ORDERS TO GO ON, THE IMPRESSION AMONG MANY iN DUBLIN IS THAT THERE ARE STILL PERHAPS SOME 60 QUOTE POLITICALS UNQUOTE DETAINED ON UNKNOWN GROUNDS, UNLESS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDENTITIES OF THE DETAINESS IS PUBLISHED, THIS MISINTERPRETATION WILL PERSIST EVEN AMONGST THOSE 
UNDERSTAND WHY MR FAULKNER MUST KEEP IRA MEN LOCKED UP. 
3. IN DUBLIN AN EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTY IS TO EXPLAIN WHY MR FAULKNER CHOSE THIS MOMENT TO SIGN THE DETENTION ORDERS, SINCE THE TIMING IS SEEN BY THE IRISH TO FIT ILL WITH HMG’S AVOWED AIM OF GETTING TRIPARTITE TALKS OFF THE GROUND AND TO SECURE A POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE SDLP/ NATIONALIST MPS TO MR MAUDLING’S OFFER OF TALKS. THE MOOD AMONGST MANY T.D.’S AND OTHER PUBLIC FIGURES MERE CONCERNED WITH THE DETERIORATING SITUATION IN THE NORTH IS ONE OF GLOOM AND DEPRESSION, DUE MAINLY TO THIS TIMING.

of course, interment. 
This lead us to the current situation where the main issue is, I think it 
is important to recall the position 
before internment was introduced, which I believe can be shown to have been one in which violence was already escalating very rapidly. 
If so, 
this should be brought but in order to answer the argument that internment has made the security situation worse. I should like details of when internment has been used previously. 
or threatened, on either side of he border, and of the results of its use. It would also be valuable to have any useful quotations that exit on internment made by Labour spokesmen. I think one should rewind the House, who will hear a great deal 
about the evils of interment, about the far greater evils of the I.R.A. This, 
i think, calls for some details of (a) 
(b) (c) their activities and their callousness; 
the open statements they have made about their activites; and 
their recent demands as a price of calling off their campaign. 
Turning next to the constitutional position. One must, of course, 
start with the usual statements about the border and the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. 
go in saying that these are not really live issues so far as anyone is concerned except the I.R.A.? Catholic Grievances There seem to be two aspects to this problem:(i) 
the complaint that individual citizens suffer discrimination; 
(ii) 
the complaint that the minority community as a whole do not participate in the forming of policy affecting their own country.

Northern Ireland 
I have been trying to ascertain how things stand. As usual, they do not stand very well. A short progress report would read as follows:- 
(1) Consultation Philip Woodfield will be visiting Belfast in the latter part of next week for the first of the regular meetings at official level. We have Monday and Tuesday in which to give him any instructions which we think necessary. 
(2) Green Paper The Northern Ireland Cabinet are meeting again to discuss this on Tuesday. 
It does not look as though publication can take place before the end of the month. 
(3) The minority and the government have only just been told of Mr. Faulkner’s reply to your suggestion that he should hurry up with the appointment of a minority representative to his Cabinet. It clearly does not take us any further at all. 
(4) 
Internment About 48 cases have been reviewed so far; and there have been 5 recommendations for release. These have not yet been actually implemented; but the Home Office are in touch with Donald Maitland about suitable Press publicity as soon as it is possible to announce that the men concerned have been freed. 
The Homo Office are in touch with Stormont about the extension of Long Kesh as regards both design of a new camp and staffing problems. They are also pursuing with the Lord Chancellor’s Department and Stormont the possibility of arranging more frequent sittings of the Superior Courts. 
(5) Security Mr. Geoffrey Johnson Smith left for Stormont yesterday and is 
still there. We ought to check early next week what success he has had as regards the UDR. On the guarding of police stations there appears to be an impasse since the Government at Stormont are tending to say that if we have no more to offer than was

The Rt Hon Edward leath MBE MP 10 Downing Street LONDON SW1 
14 October 1971 
Thank you for your message of yesterday. I am sorry that Mr Lynch should feel put out by the proposal to cut off certain Border roads but I am glad that the decision to do so has been maintained. I very much regret the press leakage which seems to have occurred on this matter; it may well have emanated in Belfast since there would have been a fairly wide circle of knowledge, though I do not think anyone in our Government Service could have been responsible because our people here were not told until well after the operation had started. 
I agree that Mr Bradford’s speech was unfortunate and have taken action which will, I hope, keep matters right for the future; over the last few days speeches by some of my colleagues and statements made by back-benchers in yesterday’s Censure debate have, I think, paid tribute to the work of the security forces and have shown a ready appreciation of the difficulties facing them. 
On the political aspect I am grateful for your agreement to publication of our Green Paper and I am pressing on with our internal discussions here which I feel will not be without some difficulty. 
I am giving further consideration to my Minority Council idea which would be linked with the proposal to appoint a Minister without Portfolio. I shall write to you on this as soon as I have clarified my views and discussed the matter with my colleagues. I hope to let you know fairly soon my intentions in the matter of an appointment to the vacancy at the Ministry of Community Relations. 
So far as the Advisory Committee on internment is concerned I understand that the difficulties which arose over the Committee’s proposal for a particular form of oath to be taken by internees before release have now been resolved. I hope an announcement about the results of the first batch of recommendations will be made soon.

UKREV BELFAST TELNO 79 OF 14 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE. FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD. 
1. JOHN HUME CAME TO TALK LAST NIGHT AND STAYED TO DINNER. HE SAID HE WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION WHICH HE REGARDED AS EXTREMEL FRAGILE. HE WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS OWN PARLIAMENTARY GROUP. HE THOUGHT THAT FITT WOULD BE OUT OF ACTION FOR SOME TIME: DEVLIN WOULD BE UNDERGOING AN OPERATION TO HAVE A PLATE PUT IN HIS BROKEN LEG: COOPER HAD JAUNDICE. HE THOUGHT THE PARTY CONFERENCE WHICH WOULD BE HELD ON 23 OCTOBER WOULD HELP TO LIFT SPIRITS: AND HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESS OF THE ALTERNATIVE ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL OPEN ON 26 OCTOBER SAYING THAT IF AS HE EXPECTED, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DENY THE USE OF THE STRABANE TOWN HALL UNDER THE POWERS TAKEN IN THE LOCAL BODIES BILL PASSED LAST WEEK, HE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD THEIR PLANS. WHILE I THINK STORMONT WERE JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING THE USE OF THE LONDONDERRY GUILDHALL I CONSIDER THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY UNWISE FOR THEM TO INTERFERE WITH THE ARRANGEMNMENTS NOW MADE FOR STRABANE AND SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS UGRGENT CONSIDERATION WITH A VIEW TO WARNING THEM OFF. 
2. WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION OF MR FAULKNER’S PROPOSED GREEN PAPER AND HUME WAS NOT DISPOSED TO THINK THAT WE WERE BEHIND IT. WHEN HE EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HMG HAD BEEN SO SLOW TO PRODUCE POLITICAL IDEAS I SAID THAT SO LONG AS THERE WAS HOPE OF THE HOME SECRETARY’S TALKS LEADING TO A POOLING OF IDEAS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR THE CHAIRMAN, WHO WAS ALSO THE CHIEF PARTY TO THE TALKS, EXPOSING HIS THOUGHTS IN ADVANCE. HUME ACCEPTED THE GOOD SENSE OF THIS AND SAID HE WAS PUZZLED BY MR FAULKNER’S DESIRE TO PUBLISH HIS IDEAS: THEY WOULD EITHER BE REJECTED OR REGARDED AS HIS MINIMUM OPENING BID. AS REGARDS PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, HUME SAID THAT WHILE ITS INTRODUCTION WOULD FALL FAR SHORT OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE SITUATION, HIS PARTY AND THE NATIONALISTS WOULD FAVOUR IT. (0£3 EEEEE PHELIM O’NEILL TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT AT THE UNIONIST COUNCIL MEETING MR FAULKNER COMMENDED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE QUOTE NATIONALISTS UNQUOTE DID NOT WANT IT.) 
3. I ASKED WHAT PADDY DEVLIN HAD IN MIND WHEN HE SUGGESTED LAST FRIDAY THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH TALKING TO BOAL AND PAISLEY. HUME SAID THAT THE FACT WAS THAT THEY REPRESENTED PROTESTANT WORKING CLASU OPINION IN A WAY IN WHICH MR FAULKNER DID NOT AND THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SOME CONTACT FOR THAT REASON ALONE. HE WAS NOT SURE HOWEVER THAT THIS CONTACT WOULD BE MADE. THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF THE MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES WORKING WITH PAISLEY AND BOAL, AND IF THEY SHOULD EVER COME TO POWER THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MINOKITY AND THE MAJORITY WOULD BECOME 
DANGEROUSLY SHARPER. HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TO ALLOW THEM TO COME TO POWER. 4.

HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TO ALLOW THEM TO COME TO POWER. 
COURT TO SIT WITHOUT JURY UNDER A JUDGE WHO COMMANDED THE RESPECT OF THE MINORITY. HE SUGGESTED O’DONNELL WHO WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE HIGH COURT. AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR CONVERSATION HE STUCK TO THE VIEW THAT THE COURT SHOULD SIT IN PUBLIC, THAT THE DEFENDENTS SHOULD BE LEGALLY REPRESENTED IN COURT AND A CROSS EXAMINATION SHOULD BE ALLOWED. I TOLD HIM THAT I COULD HOLD OUT NO PROSPECT OF THE PRESENT ARRANGEMNENTS BEING CHANGED BUT THAT I WAS PREPARED TO DISCUSS HIS IDEAS ON A THEORETICAL BASIS. TO BEGIN WITH A TRIAL IN OPEN COURT AND A CROSS EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES BY LAWYERS WAS IN MY OPINION QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION. I SAID I THOUGHT I NEED HARDLY EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHY THIS WAS SO. MIGHT IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE HOWEVER IF IN ADDITION TO THE JUDGES, TWO OBSERVERS SHOULD BE PRESENT, CHOSEN WITH THE APPROVAL OF MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES. I ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF PERSONAL THREAT IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD THING TO CHOOSE THESE OBSERVERS FROM PEOPLE IN THE PROVINCE , BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE POSSIBLE TO FIND ACCEPTABLE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN. HUME SHOWED SOME INTEREST IN THIS IDEA (WHICH I TOLD HIM HAD OCCURRED TO ME ONLY SINCE WE HAD SPOKEN ON THE TELEPHONE THE DAY BEFORE) AND I THOUGHT THAT HIS INSISTENCE ON TRIAL IN OPEN COURT WITH CROSS EXAMINATION WEAKENED IN THE LIGHT OF IT. I SAID THAT WHILE I WAS VERY HAPPY TO TALK WITH HIM, HUME WOULD DO MUCH BETTER TO TALK WITH THE HOME SECRETARY. I BELIEVED THAT IF HE DID SO THERE WOULD BE NO OBJECTION TO INTERNMENT BEING THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA, OR INDEED THE ONLY ONE, ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT FIND THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PASS ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS AS WELL. FOR OUR PART, SUCH A MEETING COULD BE ENTIRELY PRIVATE AND WE WOULD DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT NEWS OF IT DID NOT GET OUT. HUME SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, AND WONDERED WHETHER, IF A MEETING COULD BE ARRANGED, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO COME ALONE OR WITH HIS COLLEAGUES. I SAID THIS WAS FOR HIM TO DECIDE BUT I THOUHGHT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR A FIRST MEETING ALONE . 
HE SAID HE THOUGHT SO TOO, AND HE ALSO 
THOUGHT THAT IF HE DECIDED TO GO HE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE UP HIS MIND WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS COLLEAGUES. HE WOULD LET ME KNOW BY MONDAY EVENING WHAT HE HAD DECIDED. 
5. I THINK HUME VERY MUCH WANTS TO HAVE A TALK WITH MR MAUDLNG AND THAT THERE IS JUST A CHANCE THAT HE WILL PLUCK UP COURAGE AND ASK FOR ONE.

PRIME MINISTER Arrest of Detainees in Northern Ireland The Home Office have asked Stormont about the story

The original arrest is under After 48 hours 
the man has to be re-arrested under Regulation 11(i) so that he can be detained. 
It seems that the 98 people at

YOUR TELNO 234: NORTHERN IRELAND. FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A MESSAGE DATED 9 OCTOBER FROM 
TAOISEACH TO PRIME MINISTER IN REPLY TO YOUR TELEGRAM UNDER REFERENCE. 
BEGINS. I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE OF YESTERDAY CONCERNING YOUR FURTHER 
TALKS WITH MR BRIAN FAULKNER 
THE FIRST AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF YOUR MESSAGE REFER TO THE OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INTERNEES AND TO DETAILS 
OF CHANGES THAT THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT MIGHT PUT FORWARD IN RELATION TO THE OPERATION OF PARLIAMENT, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND SO ON. 
WE HAVE DISCUSSED THESE MATTERS AND YOU KNOW MY VIEWS. 
IN REGARD TO THE LATTER SUBJECT IT WOULD BE MISLEADING IF I WERE TO REFRAIN 
FROM COMMENTING THE FUTILITY OF

YOUR TELNO. 234: NORTHERN IRELAND. 1. 
FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A MESSAGE DATED 9 OCTOBER FROM 
TAOISEACH TO PRIME MINISTER IN REPLY TO YOUR TELEGRAM UNDER REFERENCE. 
BEGINS. I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE OF YESTERDAY CONCERNING YOUR 
FURTHER TALKS WITH MR BRIAN FAULKNER 
THE FIRST AND THIRD PARAGRAPHS OF YOUR MESSAGE REFER TO THE F THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INTERNEES AND TO DETAILS OF CHANGES THAT THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT MIGHT PUT FORWARD 
IN RELATION TO THE OPERATION OF PARLIAMENT, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND SO ON. 
WE HAVE DISCUSSED THESE BATTERS AND YOU KNOW NY VIEWS. 
IN REGARD TO THE LATTER SUBJECT IT WOULD BE MISLEADING IF I WERE TO REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON THE FUTILITY OF COUNTING ON THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT TO FIND THE BASES FOR ESTABLISHING PEACE, JUSTICE AND PROGRESS IN THE NORTH. TO TRY TO DO THINGS IN THIS WAY, WHILE DISCUSSION WITH THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NON-UNIONIST COMMUNITY IS BARRED BY THE EXISTENCE OF SELECTIVE AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INTERNMENT, IS, AS I HAVE SAID TO YOU, A FUTILE EXERCISE AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO THINK OTHERWISE.

APART FROM THE ISSUE OF INTERNMENT AND, AS I POINTED OUT TO YOU, THE UNSATISFACTORY TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAN IT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED THAT THE SDLP AND THE OTHER ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NON-UNIONIST COMMUNITY WILL ENTER DISCUSSIONS WHILE MR FAULKNER’S STATED TERMS REMAIN UNCHALLENGED BY YOU? 
I CANNOT THEREFORE REGARD YOUR REFERENCES IN THE FIRST

On internment, Mr. Faulkner said that he expected shortly to 
receive the first batch of recommendations of the Advisory Committee set up to consider the cases of interned persons. The Ministers reviewed the economic situation of Northern Ireland, 
which they recognised to be a matter of urgent importance requiring further study and discussion. Ministers reaffirmed the importance they attached to the consul- 
tations which the Home Secretary had begun at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland with all parties and interests in Northern Ireland. 
They considered in that context the areas of 
discussion which the Government of Northern Ireland had decided to bring forward.

J G Pilling Esq Home Office Whitehall LONDON SW1 
4 October 1971 Dear Joe 
I am sorry I have not had an opportunity before now to reply to your letter of 24 September. I can confirm that the next of kin of every single person detained was informed at the time when the Detention Order was made. The next of kin were also informed of the establishment where the detainees were being held. 
When the Internment Orders were signed no additional 
information was conveyed to the next of kin although the internees themselves were given a copy of the Interment Order. In the event of the transfer of any internee from one centre to another the next of kin are advised 
immediately. 
I can also confirm that Judge Brown’s Committee intend to consider all cases of internees whether or not representations have been made. In this connection I should add that the Committee will be drawing up a priority list and those people who have neither requested their case to be reviewed nor have had representations made on their behalf will be dealt with last.

Ireland. They noted that Mr Faulkner was unwilling to meet the emergency by seeking to form a Government which was neutral on the matter of reunification, but attached value to Mr Faulkner’s proposed appointment of a Cabinet Minister or Ministers who would be widely regarded as representative of responsible minority opinion. As regards the proposed Green Paper, the British Government were still anxious that publication, to obtain the maximum impact, should be carefully timed in relation to other political moves, and would not wish at this time to agree on a specific date for publication, but they agreed that the announcement of the other decisions to be taken at the meeting would provide a good opportunity for Mr Faulkner to obtain the concurrence of his Cabinet colleagues in the terms of the Green Paper. 
INTERNMENT The Meeting then discussed internment and related matters. 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that, from the point of view of public and Parliamentary opinion in Great Britain, there was an urgent need for reassurance that internment was fully justified for all those being held; 
it had been alleged that some people had been interned to pay off old political scores. It was, therefore, important that the Advisory Council should be seen to be working rapidly and justly, with the internees being allowed all proper facilities for legal representation and access to relevant documents. It appeared that the internment camp at Long Kesh would have to be expanded and it was important that plans should be put into effect speedily for both the building and the manning of the extension. The Home Secretary might be able to secure volunteers from members or former members of the prison service in England for duty in Northern Ireland prisons to release Northern Ireland prison officers for duty at Long Kesh, but a significant financial inducement was likely to be necessary. Lastly, while the processes in connection with internment should be seen to be working speedily and justly, an effort should be made to shorten the interval between the arrest and trial of persons charged with criminal offences in connection with public security. If the public could see that malefactors arrested by the security forces were brought swiftly to justice

it would do much to increase public confidence, and the morale of the security forces themselves; their achievements in this regard had been considerable, but they were dimmed by the absence of a swift and manifest outcome of their efforts. 
MR FUALKNER said that he had personally examined the police recommendations in all internment orders submitted to him. Orders had been made only in respect of people actively engaged in terrorism, and he had in fact refused to make orders in a few cases. The Advisory Committee had already held 4 meetings and had considered 16 cases; 32 more cases were pending and further meetings fixed to consider them. He was expecting the first batch of recommendations within the next few days. Internees were all given notice of their rights and were allowed legal advice in the preparation of their cases; but legal representation was not allowed at their appearance before the Committee, which was conducted in strict confidence with only the members of the Committee present, each of whom was provided with the relevant documents. He had already stated publicly that it would be most unusual for him not to accept a recommendation of the Advisory Committee. The test for an internee’s fitness for release was not so much his innocence of any association with terrorist organisations, but whether he could be set at large without danger to the community. Internment should properly be regarded not so much as an alternative to trial as an alternative to being shot in an act of terrorism. Long Kesh at present provided accommodation for 380 internees and would have to be extended to accommodate 640 by the end of January. It would be helpful if the Army could undertake the building work on the same basis as in the original construction, and he would discuss with the Home Secretary the possibility of securing volunteers for the prison service from England. As to the trial of those accused of criminal offences, he agreed that speedy justice was important. Delays arose not so much over offences tried summarily before the magistrates as over cases returned for trial by jury. He thought it would be advantageous if the establishment of special commissions of assize could be considered to deal speedily with offences involving security. This was a reserved matter and fell to the United Kingdom authorities. The courts had in fact dealt firmly with a large number of cases and he would supply details of these to assist public presentation in Great Britain.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that it was agreed that, at least from the point of view of opinion in Great Britain, the success of all the measures in contemplation depended very largely on its being manifest that the machinery of the Advisory Committee was working speedily and justly. It was important that the United Kingdom Government should be kept regularly informed of the position. The point had been made in discussion that, when factors came to the knowledge of the Northern Ireland Government that pointed to the need for continued detention of a person whose release was recommended by the Advisory Committee, they should be put before the Committee for consideration. As to the extension of Long Kesh, the Army would undertake the works when the Home Office in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs had provided the necessary specifications; and the Home Secretary would be ready to enter into discussion over the possibility of calling for volunteers from England for duty in Northern Ireland prisons. The Home Secretary would consider in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities the possibility of setting up special commissions of assize. Over the whole field of internment and criminal trial the need for effective public presentation must be constantly borne in mind. 
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MR FAULKNER stated that some 26,000 families were refusing to pay rents, some of them under threat of intimidation. Present legislation, which it was expected would become law during the course of the following week, provided for the diversion of social service payments to cover rents, rates and certain other liabilities such as electricity bills. A separate Bill provided for a legal means of taking over the functions of non-co-operating local authorities. The Northern Ireland Government’s proposals had been endorsed by both trade unions and employers. 
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion of Mr Faulkner’s statement, said that there was some uncertainty as to the extent to which the United Kingdom Government Departments concerned had been consulted in advance. The legislation raised points of principle which would excite great interest in Westminster, and it was essential for whitehall Departments to consider in detail the text of the legislation and to be kept in the closest touch with the way in which it was planed to implement it.

FUTURE PROCEDURE THE PRIME MINISTER said that discussion had revealed a number of matters which it would be necessary for the 2 Governments or their representatives to consider further. 
The specific decisions to be announced as a result 
of the present meeting were, through force of circumstances, predominantly directed towards improving the security situation, but it would be necessary to develop further political initiatives, without which the support of British public opinion would quickly be lost. 
He proposed 
that for the period of the emergency there should be monthly meetings at Ministerial level and fortnightly meetings at official level, the precise attendance in each case to depend on the subjects discussed. 
MR FAULKNER welcomed the Prime Minister’s proposals for regular meetings. 
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said that officials of the 2 Governments should now prepare a draft agreed statement announcing the decisions on reinforcement taken at the meeting, and balancing them, as far as possible, by references to the internment review and the continuing search for a political solution. 
After a short adjournment, the Meeting reassembled to consider a draft agreed statement prepared by officials.

ANNEX TEXT OF AGREED STATEMENT ISSUED ON 7 OCTOBER 1971 
A meeting took place at 10 Downing Street today between Mr Heath, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Mr Faulkner, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. 
Mr Heath was accompanied by the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Lord President of the Council, and the Secretary of State for Defence. The Chief of the General Staff and the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, were also present. 
The Ministers discussed all aspects of the current situation in Northern Ireland. They decided that meetings between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland governments should be held at regular and frequent intervals at both ministerial and official level in London or Belfast. 
The ministers reviewed the security situation. The United Kingdom Government have decided to raise the strength of the Army in Northern Ireland by three battalions. These extra forces will be at the tactical disposal of the GOC to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other things to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of information which is coming into the Army’s hands. 
The ministers also discussed measures to give effect to the decision to increase the strength of the Ulster Defence Regiment and to develop the regiment’s organization to increase the number of units and sub-units and thereby enhance its local character. Mr Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Army has been assigned special responsibility, at ministerial level, for UDR affairs and particularly for recruitment. He will be visiting Northern Ireland next week to confer with the UDR Advisory Council and others concerned. 
On internment, Mr Faulkner said that he expected shortly to receive the first batch of recommendations of the advisory committee set up to consider the cases of interned persons.

4. The British Government reaffirm that they will not admit the existence of any armed force other than those established under the 
Crown. The advocates of the so-called third force will not be allowed to prevail. 5. 
The British Government have been keeping in the closest touch 
with the Northern Ireland Government on the economic situation in the Province. Further meetings at Ministerial and official level are in prospect. 6. 
In order to assist Ministers in both Governments in the task of 
joint planning and the co-ordination of policy over a wide field of government it has been decided to establish a joint-committee of senior officials which will meet at frequent intervals in London and Belfast. 7. 
The British Government have noted that the Advisory Committee on 
Internees has started its work and this committee will examine each case, and the cases of those who remain interned will be kept under continuous review. The Committee will have full access to the documentary material relevant to their work and the right to interview officials. In presenting himself to the Committee an internee will be entitled to legal aid and the presence of his legal adviser. The Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs of Northern Ireland has already stated that although the role of the Committee is an advisory one he would expect to accept its advice. In the exceptional circumstance in which he did not feel able to do so he would return the case to the Committee for its further consideration giving his reasons for doing so. 8. 
Recognising the full commitment of both Governments to the existing 
programme of reform and to the need constantly to explore the field for further measures, the British and Northern Ireland Governments have decided to establish a joint commission to review action taken, the progress of action in train, and to make suggestions for future action. This commission would be small in numbers. Its composition is under discussion.

FROM UKREP BELFAST TO HOME OFFICE 
UKREP BELFAST TELNO 75 OF 6 OCTOBER. FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD. , 
THE AUTHORITIES HERE ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO 
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ACCOMMODATION FOR THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DETAINEES AND INTERNEES. 180 INTERNEES ARE AT PRESENT HELD IN LONG KESH, 40 AT CRUMLIN JAIL AND 84 DETAINEES AT CRUMLIN JAIL. CONDITIONS AT LONG KESH ARE ALREADY TOO CROWDED: CRUMLIN HAS ALREADY HAD TO RELEASE SOME CONVICTED PRISONERS BEFORE THEIR TIME TO GIVE ACCOMMODATION FOR DETAINEES AND INTERNEES: UNLESS THE PRISON’S NORMAL FUNCTION IS TO BE SERIOUSLY CURTAILED IT CANNOT BE USED TO PROVIDE LONG TERM ACCOMMODATION FOR DETAINEES AND INTERNEES. 
2. THE COMPLETION OF FURTHER COMPOUNDS AT LONG KESH WILL RAISE THE CAPACITY THERE TO 380 BY THE END OF NOVEMBER. BUT IF ARRESTS CONTINUE AT THEIR CURRENT NETT RATE OF 25 A WEEK. THERE WILL BY THEN BE A NEED FOR 480 PLACES. BY THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY 605 PLACES WILL BE REQUIRED. 
3. THE POLICE AND THE ARMY ARE FIRM IN THE VIEW THAT THE INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE NOW REAPING FROM THE INTERNMENT OPERATION MUST BE EXPLOITED TO THE FULL, AND USED IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO ROLL UP THE IRA. AT THE LAST TWO DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS MEETINGS GREAT STRESS HAS BEEN LAID ON THE FOOLISHNESS OF ALLOWING THE ARREST RATE TO BE DETERMINED BY THE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE. 
3. IT IS THEREFORE PROPOSED THAT A FURTHER 335 PLACES SHOULD BE CREATED BY: 
(A)PROVIDING 80 IN ARMAGH PRISON. THE PRISONERS THERE TO BE MOVED TO CASTLEDILLON OPEN PRISON, WHICH 
NNIS NOT AT PRESENT IN OPERATION. THIS IS BEING THOROUGHLY EXPLORED AND ASSUMING THERE ARE NO SNAGS THE EXTRA ACCOMMODATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN TWO WEEKS: 
(B) BUILDING A FURTHER THREE COMPOUNDS AT LONG KESH TO PROVIDE 255 PLACES. THIS REQUIRES THE APPROVAL OF THE UK GOVERNMENT SINCE THE EXTENSION WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT BY THE ROYAL ENGINEERS. HQNI ARE SEEKING THIS APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, AND IN VIEW OF THE OBVIOUS POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AN EXTENSION, I AM WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE FOREWARNING YOU OF THIS.

REP BELFAST TELNO 74 OF 5 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE. 
FOR MR H F T SMITH. VISIT OF MPS TO CRUMLIN AND LONG KESH. 
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OPPORTUNITY (BUT NO RELUCTANCE) FOR TALK WITH THE MPS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN TALKS WITH THE INTERNEES: I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO SOME MEMBERS BRIEFLY THIS MORNING ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN CRUMLIN, AND WAS ABLE TO TALK AGAIN WITH THEM AS THEY LEFT LONG KESH. I WAS NOT PRESENT DURING THEIR MEETINGS WITH INTERNEES, NOR AT THE FORMAL MEALS WHICH FOLLOWED THE TWO VISITS AND I HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO MEMBERS SINCE THEN. 
2. THE DELEGATION HAD LONG TALKS WITH THE GOVORNER OF CRUMLIN AND THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF LONG KESH, THE LATTER GIVING A CONVINCING AND THOUGHTFUL PERFORMANCE. QUESTIONING RANGED FAR WIDER THAN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INTERNEES WERE KEPT AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT NO NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OR MINISTER MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AS THEY AROSE. THE GOVERNORS TRIED HARD, BUT WERE INEVITABLY UNABLE TO F EEEEE GIVE SATISFACTORY ANSWERS ON SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHO DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED LONG KESH, WHAT THE EVENTUAL PLANS FOR IT WERE, AND WHAT FACTORS DETERMINED THE SERVING OF INTERNMENT ORDERS. SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE ASKED ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO SIR EDMUND COMPTON’S ENQUIRY AND JUDGE BROWN’S ADVISORY COMMITTEE. 
3. THE SEVENTY INTERNEES AND FORTY DETAINEES AT CRUMLIN HAVE ORGANISED A COMMITTEE OF THREE TO REPRESENT THEM, AND AT THE DELEGATION’S REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE MET THEM IN THE GOVERNOR’S OFFICE. THE COMMITTEE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT CONDITIONS IN THE PRISON (THESE WERE STATED TO BE A MATTER BETWEEN THE INTERNEES, THE GOVERNOR, AND THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT) AND TALKED INSTEAD ABOUT BRUTALITY WHEN THE ORIGINAL ARRESTS WERE MADE. LATER THE COMMITTEE, AFTER CONSULTING THEIR FELLOW INTERNEES TOLD THE DELEGATION THAT THEY WERE NOT WELCOME IN THEIR WING OF THE PRISON. OTHER INTERNEES VOCALLY SUPPORTED THEM. THE DELEGATION DID NOT GO IN, BUT I GATHER THEY BELIEVE CONDITIONS THERE TO BE GOOD, APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS MADE TO HELP FAMILIES OF INTERNEES. INTERNEES DI D NOT GET MUCH SYMPATHY FOR THEIR GAKBMBBBYKHSM 
IW 
ONE MEAL HUNGER STRIKE OR THE CHANG EEEEE CHANTING STAGED FOR THE MPS. 
AT LONG KESH TOO THE INTERNEES PLANNED DEMONSTRATIONS 
FOR THE DELEGATION: THERE WAS A PROFUSION OF POSTERS AND FLAGS PROTESTING ABOUT CONDITIONS?, DEMANDING FREEDOM AND CALLING FOR MR FAULKNER’S RESIGNATION: THESE WERE PRODUCED BY A DRILLED GROUP OF INTERNEES IN EACH COMPOUND, AND WHEN THEY VISITED THE COMPOUNDS MPS WERE QUICK TO NOTE THE DEGREE OF INTERNAL ORGANISATION. ONE COMPOUND IN PARTICULAR HAD A LARGE PROPORTION OF SELF CONFESSED IRA MEN SEEKING BUT FAILING TO DOMINATE A SMALLER GROUP VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS TRADE UNIONISTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS MEMBERS. MEMBERS FOUND THE CONDITIONS AT LONG KESH GRIM AND THOUGHT INTERNEES COMPARISON WITH AUSCHWITZ WAS NOT UNFAIR. THE PLACE WAS CROWDED AND THE FOOD NOT VERY TASTY. THE WHOLE PLACE HAS THE AIR OF A BUILDING SITE. 
5. MEMBERS CLEARLY REALISED THAT AT BOTH PLACES THE INTERNEES HAD PUT ON A SHOW FOR THEM. BUT I WOULD JUDGE THAT THEIR OVER WHELMING IMPRESSION WILL BE THAT WHILE CONDITIONS IN CRUMLIN ARE FAIRLY GOOD, IF A LITTLE CROWDED, CONDITIONS AT LONGNKESH ARE MORE OPEN TO CRITICISM 
- PERHAPS SEVERE.

2. The Northern Ireland Situation 
The attached report assessing the Northern Ireland situation until the end of 1971 remains valid. Its very general conclusion was that, while political progress by the end of the year was not impossible, and an improvement in the security situation could not be ruled out, it was more likely that violence would continue on roughly the present scale, thus hardening the divisions between Catholics and Protestants and further narrowing the basis for any political settlement. Events since the report was written have reinforced that general conclusion on the side of pessimism. 
There are some points on which the report needs to be brought up to date: a. 
The tripartite talks at Chequers showed that Faulkner and 
Lynch recognised that they still had some community of interest, if only in opposing the use of violence in the North. The fact that the meeting took place may at first have done something to temper the general expectation in Northern Ireland that the situation could only get worse. But the continuing violence has lead to Protestant discontent that nothing has been gained. 
b. Both Lynch and Faulkner have their political problems. Lynch 
has to contend with heavy criticism of his moderate policies within his own Cabinet and from former members of his party. Faulkner has exposed himself to Unionist criticism for being willing to consider concessions to the Catholics. Both men have so far kept their nerve but have very little room for manoeuvre. 
c. Within Northern Ireland the major opposition party - the Social 
Democratic and Labour Party - continues in its refusal to discuss reforms. The party has become increasingly committed to the demand that internment should end before political progress can be made. They are fearful of losing support in the Catholic community to the IRA if they are seen to co-operate with the Stormont Government or with Westminister.

UKREP BELFAST TELNO 72 OF 5 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE. FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD. 
1. THE ARMY HAVE SHOWN ME A BRIEF FOR GENERAL TUZO, FOR USE IN TOMORROW’S TALKS, CONTAINING A RECOMMENDATION THAT A DETERMINED EFFORT BE MADE TO RESTORE ORDER IN LONDONDERRY. I A UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY IS ALSO BEING BRIEFED ON THIS. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE FORCE LEVEL IN LONDONDERRY BE RAISED FROM THE PRESENT THREE BATTALIONS TO A TOTAL OF SIX BATTALIONS. I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MY PRELIMINARY VIEWS NOW, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT YET HAD AN OPPORT UNITY OF DISCUSSING THE PROPOSAL WITH TUZO. 
2. I THINK THAT LOW PROFILE EFFORTS TO BRING ORDER TO LONDONDERRY HAVING FAILED, AND THE CREDIBILITY OF OUR MILITARY EFFORT THERE HAVING TAKEN A KNOCK, IT IS NOW TIME TO PUT IN THE FORCES NECESSARY TO RESTORE ORDER ON THE STREETS AND, HOPEFULLY TO CAPTURE THE GUNMEN OR FRIGHTETEN THEM AWAY. IF IN ADDITION, THE RESTORATION OF ORDER AND THE REMOVAL OF IRA INTIMIDATION, SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY TO SPEAK UP, THIS WOULD PROVIDE USEFUL EVIDENCE OF WHAT MIGHT BE ACHIEVED ELSEWHERE. I THINK WE MUST REALISE HOWEVER THAT ACTION IN LONDONDERRY WILL HAVE NEGATIVE AS WELL AS POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES ELSEWHERE IN THE PROVINCE. INITIALLY, AT ANY RATE, CATHOLICS EVERYWHERE WILL BE DRIVEN FURTHER INTO THEIR STRAITJACKET OF OPPOSITION AND PROTEST. PROTESTANT SATISFACTION AT STRONG ACTION IN LONDONDERRY (AND IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY COME AS A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR FAULKNER AT THIS STAGE) WOULD INEVITABLY LEAD TO DEMANDS FOR SIMILAR ACTION ELSEWHERE, PARTICULARLY, ALTHOUGH THE CASES ARE NOT EQUAL, IN BELFAST. I WOULD EXPECT THE IRA TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITY IN BELFAST AND ELSEWHERE IN RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN LONDONDERRY. 
3. THE CONCLUSION I DRAW FROM THIS IS THAT THE PROPOSED ACTION IN LONDONDERRY SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN ARMY STRENGTH ELSEWHERE IN THE PROVINCE AS WELL. IT SHOULD BE PART OF A GENERALLY STEPPED UP EFFORT, WITH THE OPERATIONS IN LONDONDERRY BEING THE MOST EMPHATIC PART OF THAT EFFORT. I ALSO CONSIDER THAT THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL DRIVE LED FROM THE UK. THERE WOULD BE A WARNING OF OUR RESOLUTION TO PUT DOWN VIOLENCE FROM WHICHEVER QUARTER IT COMES. THERE SHOULD BE A RESTATEMENT OF THE FACT THAT NO THIRD FORCE WILL BE TOLERATED AND THAT THOSE WHO ADVOCATE IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL. A REFERENCE TO INTERNMENT SHOULD INCLUDE THE POINTS IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF MY TELEGRAM NO 71 
. THERE SHOULD BE A PASSAGE ON REFORM, 
AND IN THAT CONNECTION I SHOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THE IDEA IN PARA 6 OF MY TELEGRAM NO 52 ABOUT A STANDING COMMISSION. WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A MAJOR MINISTERIAL STATEMENT, SHOWING EQUAL DETERMINATION IN THE MILITARY AND THE POLITICAL FIELDS, AND ASSERTING THE AUTHORITY OF HMG IN THE UK IN BOTH.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland Ministers at the meeting tomorrow will have before them three main 
documents. A. 
The brief for the discussion with Mr. Faulkner on the following day (NIPMV(71) 1). 
B. A military appreciation by the Ministry of Defence (Mr. Stephens’ letter of 4th October to Mr. Armstrong). 
C. A political appreciation by the Homo Secretary. The military and political appreciations are complemented by an 
intelligence appreciation, which has been specially prepared by tho JIC on the basis of the latest information. 3. 
The problems discussed in these documents have to be considered 
against the background of Lord Carrington’s recent visit to Northern Ireland and the conclusions which he himself formed as a result. 
I think that these 
can be summarised as follows:(1) 
In principle internment has been a success. It has done what it was 
intended to do; and, although there may still be a long haul ahead, the chance of gradually bringing terrorism to an end are now reasonably good. (2) Direct rule would represent an even more appalling strain on our resources than we have hitherto been prepared to contemplate. (3) We must therefore redouble our efforts to ensure that Mr. Faulkner remains in power. 4. 
on these points; and Ministers may then wish to consider whether Lord Carrington’s diagnosis is consistent with, and confirmed by, the Home Secretary’s political appreciation (I think that.’ broadly, both appreciation will come to the same conclusion). 
You may like to begin the meeting by asking Lord Carrington to expan Ministers 
will then need to decide whether they endorse Lord Carrington’s conclusions, This will be a critical decision, since it will determine our policy for as far ahead as it is profitable to looks and its implications, both civil and military will need to be considered with care.

The civil implications of a decision to maintain Mr. Faulkner can 
perhaps be summarised by saying that we must press him to be as conc to the Opposition as he can be without alienating his own Protestant support. This concept is explored in more detail In the briefs in NIPMV(71) 1. The points which are particularly important are:(i) The reform programme (i.e. the content of the Green Paper, includin 
a "broadening" of the Stormont Government; and the timing of its publication) (ii) Internment, especially the need for speed in dealing with appeals; and 
the inapplicability of "special courts". (iii) The measures to deal with civil disobedience, especially the treatment of family allowances. (iv) The improvement in our public relations activities. (The record 
of Lord Carrington’s discussions in Belfast contains several interesting suggestions about means of identifying local opinion - in the person of local dignitaries etc. 
with the enlarged UDR). (v) The economic situation (which has been added to the agenda at 
Stormont’s request), in the light of the latest - disquieting - report from Sir Alec Cairncross. 6. 
The question of improving contact between London and Belfast is a 
rather separate issue; and it involves certain considerations about Ministeria appointments, etc., which you have it in mind to mention to the Home Secretary at some point. I would only add that most people feel that we ought not to put Mr. Faulkner himself in the position of being "summoned’ too often to London. There is some force in thin. 
But, personally. I take 
it with a grain of salt and I should not have thought that a meeting at, say, monthly intervals would be regarded as "down-grading" Mr. Faulkner’s status too much, provided that it was supplemented by other arrangements for closer and more regular contact at lower levels. This needs to be discussed with Mr. Howard Smith. 7. 
As regards the military implications of peeping Mr. Faulkner in 
power, we must clearly be prepared to intensify the drive against terrorism. The possibilities are discussed in the brief on Security Problems (Item 5 in NIP MV(71) 1) and in the military appreciation, which concludes by suggesting (paragraph 23) that there are only three realistic options, i.e. options which are open to us without placing an intolerable burden on our resources and compelling us to introduce military government.

(d) Treatment of the internees. The Home Secretary may wish to mention a rather disquieting report about certain information on this subject which has reached Sir Edmund Compton. 
(e) The Protestant right wing. The.Home Secretary may want to draw attention to the paragraph in last week’s Spectator, alleging that Westminster is beginning to change its view of Mr. Paisley and to regard him as a possible alternative to Mr. Faulkner. As you know, several attempts have recently been made to persuade us of this; but it is a little startling to see it appearing in the Press. 
9. Finally, the meeting should perhaps take note of the position as 
regards direct rule, including the Home Secretary’s recommendation (in the minute which he set you yesterday) that there is no realistic alternative to planning on this basis that the majority of the Northern Ireland public service would remain basically loyal. 
This is admittedly the only 
hypothesis on which we have been able to make preparations in Whitehall. But it does not square very well with the impression which, I understand, Lord Carrington has brought back with him, namely that in circumstances of direct rule we should face a real risk of mass withdrawal of labour from all forms of public service, including not only the Civil Service but also the police (it is disquieting how many reports refer to the low morale of the RUC) the courts and essential public utilities. 
If lord Carrington is right, we 
must either revise our own plans very drastically indeed or we must abandon the concept of direct rule as we have hitherto conceived it and be prepared in a crisis to move direct to something like military government and martial law administration. As the military appreciation shows, even direct rule entails an initial force requirement of 20 battalions at the minimum; and military government would presumably require even more? The CGS and the GOC should be encouraged to say candidly what sort of situation they do envisage if we are forced to move to a position of direct rule but cannot in fact rely on local support to any significant extent.

Nevertheless the Army is operating at a very high level of We are providing basic security throughout the Province. 
In addition about one third of our forces are available, as opportunities arise, for offensive operations such as hot pursuit of terrorists, arms searches, border patrols, and road-blocks; but this proportion will inevitably be reduced if basic security deteriorates and we have, for example, to deploy substantial forces to deal with intersectarian disturbances. 
Our dilemma is that, the greater the 
forces the IRA compel us to devote to providing basic security for the people, the fewer we have available for active operations against them. 
The specific security measures now in hand to deal with 
current problems include: a. 
Against the bombing campaign - the development of 
anti-bomb techniques, analysing all incidents to date, concentrating our defensive measures in small areas where the IRA is expected to operate next, and pursuing and developing our bomb squad techniques. 
But to pursue these measures 
effectively we need more intelligence. b.

c. To harness local energies - an expansion of the UDR.

1. THIS CONFIRMS AND AMPLIFIES OUR TELEPHONE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TALKS WITH MR FAULKNER ON THURSDAY. 
2. BLOOMFIELD TOLD ME THIS MORNING HAT HE DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE ITEMS IN THE LIST CONTAINED IN SIR BURKE TREND’S MESSAGE TO SIR HAROLD BLACK, CONTAINED IN CABINET OFFICE TELEGRAM TO ME MISC. 146 OF 11 OCTOBER. ON THE FIRST POINT HE DID NOT SEE WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE IN MIND TO IMPROVE CONTACT BETWEEN LONDON AND BELFAST, IN VIEW OF THE FREQUENT VISITS PAID BY MR FAULKNER. I SAID I DID NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE IN MIND. BLOOMFIELD ALSO SEEMED SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE THAT A FAST BALL WAS GOING TO BE BOWLED ON ITEM 3, ABOUT THE INTERNMENT SITUATION AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AGAIN I HAD TO DISCLAIM KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MIGHT COME UP, BUT SAID THAT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS HAD OCCURRED TO ME. WHEN WOULD THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE GET DOWN-TO WORK? BLOOMFIELD SAID HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO SO IN A DAY OR TWO. I SAID THAT SOME NEWSPAPERS HAD SAID THAT ALTHOUGH INTERNEES WOULD BE ENTITLED TO LEGAL ADVICE, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BRING THEIR LEGAL ADVISERS WITH THEM WHEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. I WONDERED WHETHER THIS WAS REALLY TRUE. IT WOULD LOOK ODD, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THOSE APPEARING BEFORE SIR E. COMPTON’S GROUP COULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY LEGAL ADVISERS. NEXT, I RECALLED THAT STOUT HAD TOLD YOU THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE FULL ACCESS TO RELEVANT DOCUMENTS AND WOULD BE ENTITLED TO INTERVIEW POLICE OFFICERS. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO CONFIRM THIS AND MIGHT BE USEFUL TO MAKE IT KNOWN. MR FAULKNER HAD INDICATED AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER THE TRIPARTITE MEETINGS THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE WAS AN ADVISORY ONE HE WOULD EXPECT TO TAKE ITS ADVICE. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR MINORITY OPINION AND MG EEEEE MIGHT BE GIVEN GREATER PUBLICITY. I SAID I WONDERED WHETHER, IF THESE POINTS COULD BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A CLEAR STATEMENT, IT MIGHT NOT BE A USEFUL THING TO MAKE PUBLIC. 
3. YOU 
3. YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE THAT BLOOMFIELD HAS TAKEN BADLY THE SUGGESTION THAT IN CONNEXION WITH THE ITEM ON CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THERE SHOULD BE DISCUSSION ON THURSDAY ABOUT LEGISLATION TO RECOVER RECOVER RENTS AND RATES. HE REGARDS THIS AS IMPOSING AN UNDESIRABLE DELAY. 
4. IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEXT ITEM, ON THE SECURITY SITUATION, SITUATION, BLOOMFIELD WAS HOPING THAT 
, AS THE RESULT OF LORD 
CARRINGTON’S VISIT, CERTAIN MEASURES WOULD BE DECIDED UPON, ESPECIALLY THE BLOWING-UP OF ROADS, IN TIME FOR MR FAULKNER TO ANNOUNCE THEM IN THE STATEMENT HE MAKES IN STORMONT WHEN IT REASSEMBLES TOMORROW. I SAID I COULD NOT GIVE HIM AN ANSWER ON THIS. IF THERE WAS AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR FAULKNER AND MR HEATH THAT THE THURSDAY MEETING COULD BE ANNOUNCED IN STORMONT TOMORROW, THIS MIGHT ENABLE MR FAULKNER TO DELAY REPLYING TO DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. BLOOMFIELD WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH NUMBER TEN ABOUT AN ANNOUNCEMNEMENT OF THURSDAY’S MEETING.

Compton Report Draft Statement by the Home Secretary 1. The Report of the Committee under the chairmanship of 
Sir Edmund Compton which I set up to inquire into allegations against the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of events on 9th August is being published today and copies /will be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m.] 2. 
The Government are grateful to the members of the Committee of 
Inquiry for the care and thoroughness with which they carried out their difficult task. 3. 
Following the precedent of the Bowen report on Aden in 1966 this 
report is published with an introduction by myself as Minister appointing that inquiry. 4.

operation, which was one of considerable difficulty and danger, was accomplished in a creditable manner. 7. 
I think the House on studying the Report will conclude that this I made it clear to the Committee on the day they were appointed 
that their terms of reference included complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of men arrested on 9th August who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them. The purpose of this interrogation was to obtain vital information about the terrorist forces and their stocks of arms and explosives. 
In 
these cases also the Committee found no evidence of physical brutality or of torture or of brain-washing.

(1) Were the interrogation techniques described in the Compton Report 
legal? (a) The Government have no authority to give a ruling on a point of 
law. In any case the incidents took place in Northern Ireland; and the operative law is the law of Northern Ireland. Any individual issue must therefore be settled in the Northern Ireland courts. 
(b) [If pressed]. All that the Inquiry found was a measure of ill-treatment 
incidental to but not during the actual process of interrogation. They found no brutality and no physical or mental injury. 
(2) (3) Who was responsible for authorising the interrogations? Were the methods approved by both Westminster and Northern Ireland Ministers? 
(a) In dealing with a terrorist campaign such as that in Northern Ireland intelligence is the key to successful operations; and the key to intelligence is information regarding the operations, dispositions and plans of the terrorists. Her Majesty’s Government accordingly undertook to assist the Government of Northern Ireland in arranging for the RUC to set up an interrogation centre. Advice was given, based upon the principles which have governed interrogation in the emergencies of this kind in which the United Kingdom has been involved under Governments of both Parties. These principles are described in the Government note quoted in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report. 
(b) Following the decision of the Northern Ireland Government, after consultation with Her Majesty’s Government, to exercise powers of detention and internment where necessary, the formal authority for the removal of certain individuals from the place specified in their detention orders to the interrogation centre was given by the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs. Interrogation was authorised by the Northern Ireland Government with the knowledge and concurrence of Her Majesty’s Government. 
(c) The RUC were in charge of the interrogation centre. But Army personnel were present at the centre in an advisory capacity; and for practical purposes the interrogation was a joint operation.

1. A. 
Does the Government accept the Compton Report? The Government welcome the Committee’s findings that none of 
those who were arrested on 9 August were subject to physical brutality by the security forces, much less torture or brainwashing. The Government have taken note that in a relatively small number of cases the Committee concluded that some of those arrested suffered a measure of physical ill-treatment. 
Most of the cases in which the Committee considered some physical ill-treatment had occurred related to the process of 
interrogation, and in the light of the Committee’s report, the Government are inviting 3 Privy Counsellors to examine, and provide authoritative advice on,the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while subject to interrogation, and on the application of those procedures. I would however emphasise what the Hoe Secretary said in his preface to the Report about the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary. 
As for the handful of cases where the Compton Committee thought 
that people suffered ill-treatment at the time of arrest or at a Regional Holding Centre - for example, the case of Mr. Cummings who was hooded and bound as a military precaution -, I can only say that it speaks volumes for the discipline and common sense of the many soldiers who were engaged in this large-scale and dangerous operation in which a total of 342 arrests were made that there were so very few cases of this kind and that when they did occur, on no occasion, in the Committee’s view, was ill-treatment deliberate. 
2. 
Will any disciplinary action be taken in respect of any cases where Compton concluded there had been ill-treatment? Is the Secretary of State for Defence satisfied that this report exonerates the Army? 
A. As was indicated in paragraph 18 of the Home Secretary’s 
preface to the Compton Report, the Government do not regard the Committee’s findings as in any way reflecting adversely on the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in Northern Ireland are conducting their fight against a vicious and ruthless enemy. So far as the military forces for which HMG are responsible are concerned the repo t does not appear to indicate any circumstances in which disciplinary action would be appropriate. 
It is worth pointing out that it was only in the case of 19 
persons out of a total of 342 arrested that the Compton Committee found any evidence of physical ill-treatment and that in 8 of those cases - 
/small 
those which were concerned ith the handling of suspects at the time of arrest and at Regional Holding Centres - such ill- 
treatment as there was could in no way be regarded as deliberate or as part of the routine for handling prisoners. These are remarkably

small numbers given the size of the operation of 9 August and the circumstances in which it was carried out. 
3. A. 4. A. Will any compensation be where paid to 
Compton concluded that there had been ill-treatment? There are no plans for the payment of compensation. 
Why did you not have a totally independent enquiry by someone completely uninvolved? 
and were in no may controlled or influenced by the Government. The objectivity of their Report amply illustrates their independence. 
As the Prime Minister said in the House on 23 September Sir Edmund is not in the employment of either the United Kingdom or the Northern Ireland Government. His status as a Parliamentary Commissioner is similar to that of a judge. 
5. A. 
Why was the enquiry not held in public? 
Because this would have meant identifying individual members of the security forces who would have thus been exposed to the

7. A. 
Was not much of the evidence which the Committee received from he security forces biassed? 
It was for the Committee to examine the evidence of the security 
forces; and they weighed it with great care, as they did such evidence as was available from other sources. 
As the Report makes clear, the Committee found the evidence of 
the medical officers particularly valuable and there is no doubt that the Committee regarded them as objective witnesses. The Committee also had full access to the contemporary medical records and found these very helpful too. 
In the great majority of cases the Committee 
were able to set against the evidence of the security forces nothing more than unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations which were all that they had before them. In many cases the Committee felt unable to carry the matter any further; but in the Government’s view the balance of credibility is clear. 
8. 
Does the Report cover the allegations in the Amnesty International Report? 
Many of the allegations contained in the Amnesty International Report are made in general terms and not linked with specific 
individuals. But it seems clear that a large number of them are amongst those dealt with by the Compton Committee in their Report. 
9. A. 
Does the Report deal with all the allegations which have been reported in the Press (Sunday Times, Irish Press etc)? 
No. For example, the Sunday Times of 17 October referred to 
the cases of three men arrested after 9 August. These are not dealt with in the Compton Report but as was announced last week, are the subject of a further, separate enquiry by Sir Edmund alone.

12. 
Who was responsible for authorizing the interrogations? Were the methods approved by both Westminster and Northern Ireland Ministers?

What Bowen? A. As the Government’s note on interrogation which they put to the 
Compton Committee said, the rules governing the conduct of interrogation were changed following the Bowen Report to provide for a daily inspection by a medical officer of those being interrogated. 
32. A. Bowen criticised the sharing of responsibilty for interrogation

No. It was for the Northern Ireland Government to decide on

it really true that the continuous noise is to prevent interrogation being overheard? Is it not a psychological weapon to break down resistence? Why is hooding necessary for security reasons? 
Is A. The use of noise and hooding has two purposes. One is to 
prevent suspects overhearing or seeing each other and so recognising each other. If a detainee thinks that he has been recognised by his fellow detainees, he will naturally believe in today’s situation in Northern Ireland that he will run the risk of IRA vengeance after hiS release. In such circumstances he is going to be much less willing to give information than he would be if he knew that his identity remained unknown to the other detainees. There are plenty of examples of how the IRA deal with their own men and women who are suspected of giving information to the authorities,

- 
No. As the Compton Report makes clear, the allegations that those of Mr. Cummings and Mr. 
Gilmore - did the Committee find that those arrested had suffered a measure of physical ill-treatment at the time of arrest, and this 
was not deliberate. When this is set against the total of 342 arrests which the troops made on 9 August, I can see little reason for changing the Army’s orders about arresting people. 
39. A. 
How do you account for some of those arrested having black eyes and other injuries on entry to the Holding Centres? 
A number of complaints were made that those arrested were 
Suffering from minor injuries such as cuts and bruises when they arrived at the Holding Centres. The Compton Committee looked into all these and either discounted them or were unable to reach a conclusion because of a conflict of evidence. There is nothing I can usefully add to their findings. 
40. A. 
Why no medical check on entry to Girdwood? Because of an unavoidable last minute change of plan medical 
cover at the Holding Centre had to be provided by two Regimental Medical officers who were also responsible for treating injured soldiers from their units and civilian casualties in the vicinity. The demands on them were such that they could not be at the Holding Centre all the time and they were therefore unable to examine each arrested person as he arrived. However, there was a medical orderly there all the time and one or other of the RMOs was on call at 30 minutest notice. In fact a number of arrested persons at Girdwood Park who either asked for treatment or clearly needed it were treated by the RMOs. 
41. What about alleg ations that in several cases the Army arrested the wrong men or seized relatives if they could not get the person they wanted? 
A. In an operation of the kind that was carried out on 9 August 
there were bound to be some cases of mistaken identity. More often than not these could not be sorted out on the snot but once it was established that an arrested man was not the person who was wanted he was released. 
I am not aware of any cases where it has been shown that troops 
arrested people who were not wanted simply because they could not find the person they were looking for.

ANNEX 1. On 31 August 1971, I appointed a Committee of Inquiry under the 
chairmanship of Sir Edmund Compton, GCB, KBE, with His Honour Edgar Fay, QC, and Dr Ronald Gibson, CBE, as members, with the following terms of reference:"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9 August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". 
2. The Committee of Inquiry visited Northern Ireland from 
1 September until 26 October and have now sent me their report which is published in this Command Paper. The Situation in Northern Ireland 3. 
In considering the Committees report it is important to 
have in mind the circumstances in Northern Ireland in which the Northern Ireland Government decided to exercise their powers under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 to arrest, detain or intern persons suspected of having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order. 4. 
At the beginning of February this year the IRA began to increase 
the ferocity of their well-established campaign of violence. A marked increase in intensity occurred in July, and has been maintained up to the present time. 
This campaign of murder and intimidation has included 
gun attacks on military and police patrols, explosive attacks on offices and buildings, together with indiscriminate bombing of occupied buildings in the cities, killing and injuring members of the general public. More recently there has been a concerted attack on individual police officers, police premises and the homes of police officers. Since [June 1972] 87 civilians, 11 members of the RUC and 38 members of the Armed

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
Forces are known to have been killed; and many civilians and members of the Armed Forces have been injured, some seriously. There have been over 800 incidents involving explosives; and the weight of explosives used by the terrorists so far in 1971 has been calculated at about 10, 000 lbs. 
In 1971, up to the morning of 8 November, the 
security forces had uncovered 171 pistols and revolvers, 127 rifles, 12 machine guns, 68 shotguns, 67,646 rounds of ammunition, over one ton of explosives, 1,451 pipe, petrol and nail bombs, 117 grenades, 26 gallons of acid, and large quantities of fuses, detonators and electric cable. These figures refer only to arms found in Northern Ireland; they do not include, for example, the large quantity of arms recently discovered at Amsterdam. 5. 
The aims of the IRA are to intimidate the population by brutal 
terrorism and so to prevent any co-operation with the Government, the police and the courts of law; to inhibit normal political activity and constitutional progress; and to cause the public in Great Britain to become so sickened by the ceaseless bloodshed and destruction that the Army’s withdrawal will come to be seen as the lesser of two evils. No responsible Government can afford to yield to pressures of this kind. Introduction of Internment 6. 
The preservation of law and order in Northern Ireland is primarily 
the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government. By July and early August the deterioration in the situation in Northern Ireland had reached the point where they felt it necessary, with the agreement of Her Majesty’s Government, to resort to their powers of internment. 7. 
In announcing the decision to introduce internment on 9 August 
1971 the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr Brian Faulkner, said:. "If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and social development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of goodwill, 
however divergent their legitimate political views, may participate to the full. 
our policy. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of

"Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry them out. "Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to the law. Nor have such methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. 
But the terrorist 
campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. "I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs". 
8. 337 men were arrested on Monday 9 August; and the arrests of 
others under the Special Powers Act have continued. 889 had been arrested by midday on 6 November, 
1971. In each case very careful 
consideration was given to the question whether an internment order was necessary. 
In the event 299 had been interned by 6 November and were 
being held at Long Kesh internment camp. 99 were being held under detention orders in Belfast Prison. 486 had been released and five were being held pending a decision on the making of detention orders. 9. 
Wherever possible, the normal processes of law are followed. 
Since 9 August 317 persons have been arrested and charged in the ordinary way with offences arising from civil disturbances. 10. 
An advisory committee under Regulation 12 of the Special Powers 
Act has been set up under the chairmanship of His Honour Judge Brown to review the cases of all those against whom internment orders are made. The members are Mr R W Berkeley and Mr P N Dalton. The rate of

progress of this review is dependent on the time required to work up cases for its consideration; but at 2 November 99 cases had been reviewed. In the light of the committee’s recommendations to the Minister of Home Affairs of the Northern Ireland Government, eight internees had been released] Two further releases had been made on the advice of the RUC. 
Allegations of Physical Brutality 11. 
A number of allegations were made about the treatment of those 
who were arrested on 9 August. I thought it right that these allegations should be investigated by an impartial inquiry; and it was for this reason that I appointed the Committee whose report has now been presented to me. The Committee’s Findings 12. 
I asked the Committee to adopt procedures which were designed to 
protect the lives of those who had conducted the arrests and interrogations against the risk of retaliation. Nevertheless, every individual who believed that he had grounds of complaint had the opportunity to put his case forward and was assured of a full and impartial hearing. It is significant that so many of those concerned failed to take this opportunity. The Committee carried out a thorough examination of the evidence, both oral and documentary, put forward by members of the security forces. 
In the great majority of cases they set against 
it nothing more than unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations which is all that they had before them. In many cases the Committee themselves have felt unable to carry the matter any further; but in the Government’s view the balance of credibility is clear. 13. 
The allegations which the Committee have examined fall broadly 
into two classes, those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concerned with the subsequent process of interrogation. As regards the former category it emerges from the report that both the number and the nature of the complaints which in the Committee’s view had, or may have had, some substance are very limited. 
Indeed, the record of events 
reflects great credit on the security forces, who carried out a difficult and dangerous operation in adverse circumstances with commendable

restraint and discipline. The more serious allegations which the Committee were able to investigate relate to 11 cases during the subsequent period of interrogation. Here again the Committee have found no evidence of physical brutality, still less of torture or brain-washing; and there is no medical evidence of physcial or mental injury. Their findings about physical ill-treatment do, however, raise certain questions about the detailed application of the general rules governing interrogation. 14. 
These rules are summarised in the Government’s evidence to 
the Committee (paragraph 46) which also points out that: "The precise application of these general rules in particular circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. 
Intelligence is the key to successful operations against 
terrorists, and the key to intelligence is information regarding their operations, their dispositions and their plans. When combating a terrorist campagin, time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons, arms and explosives, and thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the civil population". 
15. In the present circumstances of Northern Ireland, as described in 
paragraphs 3-5 of this note, it is imperative to obtain all available intelligence in order to save the lives of civilians and members of the security forces; and it is therefore essential to interrogate suspects who are believed to have essential information. The principles applied in the interrogation of suspects in Northern Ireland since August this year, and the methods employed (which are necessary not only for reasons of control but also to protect the lives of those being interrogated against the risk of reprisals), are essentially the same as those which have been employed in all emergencies of this kind in which Britain has been involved in recent years. 
The rules now in force, as summarised in paragraph 46 of the report, were issued in 1965 and were revised in 1967 in the light of

recommendations made by Mr Roderick Bowen QC in a report on the procedures for the arrest, interrogation and detention of suspected terrorists in Aden (Cmnd 3165). Action by the Government 16. 
The Government reject any suggestion that the methods currently 
authorised for interrogation contain any element of cruelty or brutality. The report of the Committee confirms this view. But it also brings out the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary. The Government have therefore decided that it would be right to set up machinery for examining and providing authoritative advice upon the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while subject to interrogation, and the application of those procedures, 17. 
The Government are grateful for the care and thoroughness 
with which the members of the Committee of Inquiry carried out their difficult task. The main strain of protecting the population in Northern Ireland falls upon the Armed Forces and the RUC. It is clear from the Committee’s report, and from personal observation by a large number of responsible witnesses from all walks of life, that the security forces have discharged their onerons duties with the utmost restraint. 
Despite 
provocations of which the Press and other public media give us daily evidence, those responsible for arrests have carried out their duties with a high regard for humanitarian principles. The Government do not regard the findings of the Committee as in any way reflecting adversely on the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in Northern Ireland are conducting their fight against a vicious and ruthless enemy.

In dealing with a terrorist campaign such as that in Northern Ireland, 
intelligence is the key to successful operations, and the key to intelligence is information regarding the operations, dispositions, and plans of the terrorists. Her Majesty’s Government accordingly acceded to a request from the Government of Northern Ireland to assist the RUC in setting up an interrogation centre. Advice was given, based upon the principles which have governed interrogation in the emergencies of this kind in which Britain has been involved under Governments of both parties. These principles are described in the Government note quoted in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report. 
2. Following the decision of the Northern Ireland Government; after 
consultation with Her Majesty’s Government, to exercise powers of detention and internment where necessary, the formal authority for the removal of certain individuals from the place specified in their detention orders to the interrogation centre was given by the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs. 
Interrogation was authorised by the Northern 
Ireland Government with the knowledge and acquiescence of Her Majesty’s Government. 
3. The RUC were in charge of the interrogation centre, but Army 
personnel were present at the centre in an advisory capacity, and for practical purposes the interrogation was a joint operation. 
4. The methods employed were approved in principle by Ministers of 
both Governments; but their detailed application was necessarily a matter for the judgment of those concerned locally.

PRISONER HANDLING IN INTERROGATION CENTRES NORTHERN IRELAND REPORT BY THE INTELLIGENCE CO-ORDINATOR 
Minutes of the Meeting of Ministers (GEN.47(71)6th Meeting 
18 October) instructed the Intelligence Co-ordinator "in consultation with officials of the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Services, to make an immediate assessment of the methods of interrogation suitable for use in Northern Ireland." In accordance with the above instructions the Intelligence 
Co-ordinator recommends as follows:1. 
That the handling of detainees and their subsequent 
interrogation in Northern Ireland should continue to be governed by the general principles laid down in JIC(65)15 and amendment dated 10 February 1967. 
[Annexes A and B respectively.] 2. The responsibility for all prisoner handling and 
interrogation methods employed at the special interrogation centre should rest with a senior police supervising officer. The role of military officers attached to the centre should be purely advisory. 3. 
There should be substantial evidence of a detainee’s 
involvement in terrorist activities before he is selected for protracted interrogation at the special interrogation centre.

JOINT DIRECTIVE ON MILITARY INTERROGATION IN INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS OVERSEAS 
Report by the Joint Intelligence Committee INTRODUCTION 
Persons arrested or detained during Internal Security 
operations or in near emergency situations are likely to be valuable sources of intelligence. They may be the only sources of intelligence at a time when it is urgently required. 
2. Successful interrogation depends upon careful planning 
both of the interrogation itself, and of the premises Wherein it is conducted. It calls for a pychological attack. Apart from legal and moral considerations, torture and physical cruelty of all kinds are professionally unrewarding since a suspect so treated may be persuaded to talk, but not to tell the truth. Successful interrogation may be a lengthy process. 
3. 
treated from the moment of his arrest and adequate facilities provided for his interrogation. 
4. The aim of this Directive is to- 
(a) establish rules for the conduct of interrogation by military personnel. 
(b) Set out the requirements for successful interrogation. 
TREATMENT OF DENTAINEES 5. Broad princples for the treatment of persons under 
arrest or detention during civil disturbances are laid down in Article 3 of The Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949). Military personnel will follow these principles when conducting interrogation. These principles are 
(a) Persons taking no active part in hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely Without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth, wealth or any other similar criteria. 
Any detainee therefore must be properly handled and

Rules of Detention 7. 
If the local regulations do not allow detention for 
periods longer than twenty-four hours without the detainee being brought before a magistrate, detailed interrogation is unlikely to succeed. If detailed interrogation is to be carried out properly, the difficulty may be overcome by obtaining, in conjunction with Special Branch, proper legal authority for the increase of the period within which the detainee must be brought before a magistrate. 
Application to Interrogation 8. 
To obtain successful results from interrogation, the 
actual and instinctive resistance of the person concerned to interrogation must be overcome by permissible techniques. This will be more easily achieved by sustained interrogation in a atmosphere of rigid discipline. It may therefore be necessary for interrogation to be carried out continuously for long periods both by day and by night with consequent disruption of the normal routine of living. 
INTERROGATION The Object of Interrogation 
10. The object of interrogation is to obtain reliable information, not to obtain evidence. Interrogations to obtain information are therefore conducted without regard to the rules which govern the admissibility of a statement before a court of law. The responsibility for obtaining a statement in compliance with the Judges’ Rules for use as evidence ill not normally rest with a military interrogator. 
Organisation of Interrorgation Arrest 
11. It is essential that moral ascendancy over the detainee is established immediately. The interrogator dust remember that he is engaged in a contest of wills. He has the advantage that from the moment of arrest the detainee may 
suffer mental strain to a greater or lesser degree, and that he has control over the freedom and movements of the 
Under conditions of emergency, or near emergency, there

detainee. Prior to arrest, whenever possible, as much 
information as can be obtained about the detainee should be made available to the interrogator. if the interrogator can lead th detainee to believe that he has extensive know- 
ledge of his background, the interrogator’s position is considerably strengthened. The sort of information which Will have to be noted and reported in the first instance will include 
(a) Full name (b) Date and place of birth (c) Current address (d) Family details (e) Employment (f) Reasons for arrest 
(g) Circumstances of arrest, including date, time and place 
(h) A list of all detainee’s personal effects, for which a receipt will be given. This list and the foregoing details should accompany the deta..nee if he is moved. 
12. If an interrogator does not speak the local language and has to work through an interpreter, not only will the interrogation be slow but the interrogator will lose a degree of control over the detainee. Wherever possible, interrogators should speak the local language and should be briefed, or brief themselves, on the country in which they are working and on the ways of life and characteristics of its inhabitants. 
Tactical (Primary) Interrogation 
13. This should be carried out as soon as possible after arrest to establish(a) Whether the right person has been arrested (b) Any information of immediate tactical value 
(c) Whether the detainee is worth more detailed interrogation. 
14. It must be carried out irrespective of location, time available, or administrative support. 
15. At this stage, the detainee is probably suffering from the shock of arrest, and due advantage must be taken of this by the interrogator. 
16. Any information obtained should be noted and made available to the interrogation staff before any subsequent

Detailed (Secondary) Interrogation 17. Accomodation. Adequate accommodation and efficient administration are pre-requisites in establishing conditions necessary to produce the right impact on detainees 
and to 
provide the interrogators with conditions conducive to success. The promises used as an Interrogation Centre should fulfil the following conditions 
(a) They should be isolated from the public with strict security precautions against intrusion and escape. To protect the morale of tho staff the centre should not be too isolated. It must have speedy communication links with Special Branch Headquarters, or the organisation directing the interrogation. 
(b) Accommodation for the detainees should be so arranged that they can be isolated not only from the outside world but from each other. The administrative quarters should be separated from the detainee compound. 
(e) Detainees must be afforded adequate toilet, bathing and exercise facilities. 
(d) Means of lighting, heating or ventilation and cooking must be available. 
(e) Technical facilities may be required for monitoring purposes. 
(f) Facilities for medical treatment should be readily available. 
Dissemination of Information 
18. In addition to the requirement for ample clerical assistance, including tape-recording facilities, there must be adequate arrangements for disseminating information obtained through interrogation to the authorities who need it, with the minimum of delay. 
Administration 
19. Administrative duties should be kept apart from interrogation duties. Skilled interrogators are in short supply and should not be burdened with administrative tasks. Interrogation is an exacting business and interrogtors should be able to rely on maximum support from the administration, 
20. Guards. Guards must be provided either from Police or Military sources, working twenty-four hour watches. They must be given special instruction and should not be changed more than necessary. They must be high quality. 
21, staff. Those employed in interrogation centres, from the Commandant downwards, should be people of integrity, incorruptible, and firm but not bullies. The quality of the guards in particular will be reflected in the atmosphere of the centre. If there are female detainees they must be in the care of female staff.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
22. Control. Detainees should not be sent to the Interrogation Centre except on the orders of the organisa- 
tion for which the Centre is working, otherwise it may become over-crowded. In times of emergency, it may be necessary to establish pre-interrogation and postinterrogation compounds to house detainees awaiting interrogation or disposal after interrogation. 
Disposal of Detainees 
23. Although disposal of detainees after interrogation is not the responsibility of military interrogators, they are vitally interested in this matter. The details revealed by detainees who are released immediately after interrogation concerning interrogation procedures may assist subsequent detainees to resist interrogation, thus making the task of the interrogators more difficult. It will be usual therefore for interrogators to request Special Branch to endeavour to obtain authority to retain detainees until some time has elapsed after interrogation, if that authority does not exist already. 
MILITARY INTERROGATION TEAMS Administrative Responsibility 
24. In areas where there is no military headquarters, the local civil authorities (usually the Special Branch) with whom the team is working are to be responsible for the provision of living and working accommodation, transport and other administrative requirements. Where there is a local military headquarters it may be more convenient for the teams to be provided with living accommodation and transport under military arrangements. 
Right of Access 
25. Although a team may be working under the operational control of the Head of Special Branch, it will have the right of access at all times to the local Military Commander or if there is no local Military Headquarters, to the Ministry of Defence DI(MI)16 for any guidance which they may require.

4 THE ARREST OPERATION ON 9 AUGUST 1971 29. As explained to us, the overriding requirement that governed the planning 
and execution of this operation was that complete security should be maintained about the identity of the persons to be arrested and the date and time when the arrests were to be carried out. We understand that the authorities accepted that in consequence of this security requirement, the operation would be carried out with a considerable element of local improvisation and might be attended by some administrative confusion, but that they considered this to be the lesser evil in relation to the paramount need to maintain security and achieve surprise. 30. 
A factor that added to the element of improvisation in one particular 
area was the decision, taken late on 7 August, not to locate the Belfast Regional Holding Centre in Crumlin Jail itself as had been planned up to that date but to set up the Holding Centre in the adjacent Girdwood Park Territorial Army Centre. We have no doubt that some of the defects in the arrangements at Girdwood, which we notice later in this Report, are to be attributed to this last minute change of plan. 31. 
1. 32. 
The operation consisted of five phases as follows:The arrests 
Parties of soldiers effected arrests according to lists prepared by the 
Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch. Very occasionally RUC officers acted as guides but in all cases the arresting was done by the military. Speed was the prime consideration to avoid the chance of hostile crowds gathering even at that early hour. Each arrester completed a report relating to the person he arrested. 33. 
The arrests took place at 0430, or as near to that time as possible, on 
Monday 9 August. Each soldier making an arrest was instructed to say: "I am arresting you under the powers conferred by the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922" 
and to add, if a person questioned the arrest in any way, no more than: "I am not required to give any further explanation. I warn you that if you resist arrest you may have committed an offence"

34. As to the manner of arrests, the arresting soldiers were governed by a general instruction requiring them never to use more force than the minimum necessary to enable them to carry out their duties. Except in one Brigade area, they had no specific orders about the use of restraints on arrested persons. 2. 
Transport to Regional Holding Centre 35. There were 3 Regional Holding Centres, each under the overall charge of 
a senior officer where identification of arrested persons was confirmed and the decision taken whether they should be detained or released. These were Magilligan Weekend Training Centre in County Londonderry, Ballykinler Weekend Training Centre n County Down and Girdwood Park Territorial Army Centre in Belfast. 36. 
In Belfast the movement of the arrested person was short in time and 
distance from the point of arrest to a rendezvous for preliminary identification (often at the vehicle to be used for the next stage of the journey) and thence to the Regional Holding Centre at Girdwood Park. In the other two regions the distances were in most cases much greater and the arrested person was usually taken from the point of arrest to a rendezvous for preliminary identification (normally at an established point like a barracks) designated a Prisoner Collection Point (PCP) and thence to either the Ballykinler of Magilligan Regional Holding Centre. 3. Processing at the Holding Centres 37. 
All arrested persons were interviewed by RUC Special Branch officers 
prior to the decision about detention. The processing at Holding Centres lasted from early 9 August to early 11 August, but arrested persons whom it was decided not to detain, were released at any time during that 48 hours. 38 
At all the Holding Centres a uniform system of records was maintained. 
including entry and exit registers and a photograph of each arrested person on entry. At Ballykinler and Magilligan a medical officer was in post who carried out an examination of each arrested person on entry And recorded the result of the examination. At Girdwood a medical orderly was in attendance

and a doctor was within call at 30 minutes notice. 
medical examination on entry. 4. Transport to places of detention 39. 
There was no system of Arrested persons who were to be detained, (Apart from a limited number 
mentioned in the next paragraph) were sent by helicopter from Ballykinler and Magilligan to the Maidstone in Belfast harbour, and on foot from Girdwood to Crumlin Jail. Girdwood is immediately adjacent to the Prison, and the arrested persons passed into the Prison through a hole, made early on 9 August, in the wall that divides the Prison area from Girdwood Park. Also a wing of the Prison was used an an annex to the Girdwood Regional Holding Centre. 5. 
Special Questioning 40. A limited number of persons whom it had been decided to detain, were 
selected for interrogation in depth and on 11 August were moved for that purpose from their Holding Centres to a place other than the place specified in the detention order before being lodged in detention in Crumlin Jail on 16 and 17 August. (This special class of arrested persons is covered in section 6 of our Report). 
41. The number of persons arrested and handled by the Holding Centres was as follows:

5 PATTERN OF COMPLAINTS 42. The complaints investigated by us related to actions from arrest to 
arrival at one or other of the Regional Holding Centres, to events at the Centres, and to a place at which interrogation in depth took place. While many of the complaints were of an individual nature, others fell into categories where a number of complainants alleged that they were collectively subjected to treatment of which they complained. Although the individual complaints must be dealt with separately, we have found it convenient to group together the above mentioned categories for the purpose of our Report. In listing these categories we have used names that correspond to descriptions and references commonly used in complainants’ statements and press reports. These names are not to be taken as indicating the precise nature of these events as they appeared on investigation. These groups we deal with under the following headings: 1

DETAILS OF ALLEGATIONS, EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSIONS 1 
Interrogation in Depth 43. Under our terms of reference we are asked to examine allegations in 
respect of persons who were questioned in depth after a detention order had been made against them. Like the other complainants with whom we are concerned, these men were arrested on 9 August: but whereas the others then arrested were either released or placed in detention by 11 August, these men were on that date removed to another place for a period of intensive questioning before being lodged by 17 August in the place specified in the detention order. 44. 
Complaints of 11 men have been transmitted to us, which include specific 
allegations of physical ill-treatment during this period of intensive questioning The men are: 
James Auld Joseph Clarke Michael Joseph Donnelly Kevin Hannaway Patrick Joseph McClean Francis McGuigan* Sean McKenna Gerald McKerr Patrick McNally Patrick Joseph Shivers Brian Turley 
* Whilst Mr McGuigan’s name is included in this list because we understand the Sunday Times had sight of a statement from him, we have seen no such statement ourselves. The Sunday Times tell us they inadvertently returned the original without taking a copy. For this reason we have been unable to investigate any specific allegations, although we have ascertained Mr McGuigan was at the interrogation centre at the same time as the other men.

Timetable of events 45. 
We have ascertained that the timetable of events for all the men in 
this category was as follows:11 August - 0630 
Arrival from a Regional Holding Centre at an interrogation centre (hereinafter called "the centre 
11 August - 1545

Government policy in relation to interrogation 46. 
In the course of our investigation we were requested by Her Majesty’s 
Government to receive a note on the subject of Government policy in relation to interrogation methods. We were asked also to include this note in our report for publication. It runs as follows: "NOTE ON INTERROGATION 
1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees 
and the processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules. to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen QC issued in November 1966 (Cmnd 3165). 
2. These general rules include the following safeguards: 
a. Medical examination and record of weight of subject on admission and discharge. 
b. Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer. 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 485\\IMG_5191_PREM_15_485 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]
Reference 1 - 50.00% Coverage
Page 1 : (0,0) - (659,906)
Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
c. The following are prohibited: 
(i) Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in 
particular humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949)). 
3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding their operations, their dispositions, and their plans. When combating 
a terrorist campaign time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons, arms and explosives and thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the civil population. 
4. Information can be obtained more rapidly if the person being 
interrogated is subjected to strict discipline and isolation, with a restricted diet; but violence or humiliating treatment, as explained above, are forbidden. Equally any person undergoing interrogation must be assured of security against either violent treatment by his fellow detainees or recognition by them; the evidence of IRA vengeance against informers underlines the importance of this safeguard." 
47. The evidence we received from the officials we interviewed about the 
application of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum we reproduce above can be summarised as follows. The objectives mentioned in the memorandum may involve the use of the following methods, the circumstances and duration of whose application may vary according to the staff and accommodation available at the interrogation centre and the length of time for which detainees may be left alone or must be kept together:- 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 485\\IMG_5192_PREM_15_485 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]
Reference 1 - 50.00% Coverage
Page 1 : (0,0) - (590,787)
Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
a. Wall Standing 48. Requiring detainees to stand with their arms against a wall but not in a position of stress provides security for detainees and guards against physical violence during the reception and search period and whenever detainees are together outside their own rooms in a holding room awaiting interrogation. It also assists the interrogation process by imposing discipline. Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase separate custody 
of staff sufficient to provide for the of each individual while in transit between his own 
room and the interrogation room, there would be increased risks of physical contact between detainees and guards. 
b. Hooding 49. The hood (a black pillow-slip which the detainee is not required to wear 
while he is being interrogated or while he is alone in his room) reduces to the minimum the possibility that while he is in transit or with other detainees he will be identified or will be able to identify other persons or the locations to which he is moved. It thus provides security both far the detainee and for his guards. It can also in the case of some detainees, increase their sense of isolation and so be helpful to the interrogator thereafter. 
c. Noise 50. The continuous noise to which detainees may be subjected prevents their overhearing or being overheard by each other and is thus a further security 
measure. By masking extraneous sound and making communication more difficult it may enhance the detainee’s sense of isolation.

d. Bread and Water Diet 51. A diet of bread and water at six-hourly intervals may form part of the atmosphere of discipline imposed upon detainees while under control for the purpose of interrogation. 
The 
rules about medical inspection are referred to in paragraph 2 of the Note above. 
52. These methods have been used in support of the interrogation of 
a small number of persons arrested in Northern Ireland who were believed to possess information of a kind which it was operationally necessary to obtain as rapidly as possible in the interest of saving lives, while at the same time providing the detainees with the necessary security for their own persons and identities. 
Course of Investigation 53. 
It has been our object in this, as in the other areas of our 
investigation, to test allegations of physical ill-treatment against all evidence, documentary and oral, that we can get in order as far as we can to establish the facts about the treatment that took place. 
We have had

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
55. The contemporary documentation which we can specify, aid which if 
of the first importance in testing the facts, is an follows: a. The entry medical record, written by the doctor when he examined each detainee on entry into the centre on 11 August. The purpose of this examination was for the doctor to certify whether the detainee was fit for interrogation we have confirmed that before he did so, he was briefed as to the conditions that the interrogatee would experience. The patient was stripped and examined, his medical history and present state of health ascertained and recorded, with notes of the patient’s weight and the existence or otherwise of outs, bruises or other bodily damage. b. The exit medical record, written by the same doctor, when he examined the detainee on leaving the centre. c. Colour photographs of the detainee, naked, back view and front view, likewise taken on his leaving the centre. d. The prison on medical record of the examination carried out by the prison doctor after the detainee was lodged in detention in Crumlin Jail. e. The feeding record. We have examined the contemporary record which was kept showing the time at which each detainee was offered drink and food, if he took it and what he took. 
The Allegations 56. 
We deal first with those allegations of physical ill-treatment common 
to all or most of the complainants and turn thereafter to allegations limited to particular individuals.

Common Allegations 57. 
All the interrogatees whose statements we saw complained of one or 
more of the following matters:a. Hooding Head hooded in a navy or black coloured bag of tightly woven or hessian cloth at all times other than interrogation interviews. 
b. Noise Held in a room where there was a continuous noise variously described as loud and deafening like the escaping of compressed air, the roar of steam, the whirring of helicopter blades, or a drill. Returned to the room with this noise between periods of interrogation. 
c. Enforced posture on wall Facing wall, hands high above head on wall: legs spread apart; forced with batons to maintain posture; so kept till collapsed, when lifted up again; treatment continued for 2 or 3 days, or up to 4 days. 
d. Sleep Variously complained that had none for 2 or 3 days or very little. e. Food 
Variously complained that deprived of food for 2 or 3 days, or that diet severely restricted to occasional administration of dry bread and a cup of water until the last day or so. One man (Mr Shivers) said he had nothing to drink for the first 4-5 days. 
Common Allegations - Evidence of Supervising Staff 58. 
The persons supervising the operation commented as follows:-

Hooding 59. 
It was confirmed that the detainees were required to be kept fully hooded except when interrogated or in rooms by themselves. 
This meant, 
therefore, that hooding was confined to journeys outside the centre or movement within it and to the periods when complainants were held jointly or at the wall (see below). We were told that in fact some complainants kept their hoods on when they could have removed them if they wished. Noise 60. 
It was confirmed that while the detainees were held together pending 
interrogation or between interrogations, they were subjected to a continuous hissing noise, or electronic "mush", loud enough to mask extraneous sounds and prevent effective oral communication between detainees. The noise was neutral, ie no music or speech sounds were intruded. Posture on the Wall 61. 
tions, the detainees were made to stand against a wall in a required posture (facing wall, legs apart, leaning with hands raised up against wall) for anything between 4 and 6 hours, except for periodical lowering of the arms to restore circulation. It was pointed out that the posture was not the same as the search position. This was not a stress posture: that is, the legs were not so wide apart, the arms so stretched up, or the weight of the body put forward to the same extent as in the search position. 62. 
their head against the wall were prevented from doing so. If a detainee collapsed on the floor, he was picked up by the armpits and placed against the wall to resume the approved posture. 
It was confirmed that from time to time pending and between interrogaIt was confirmed that detainees attempting to rest or sleep by propping (In Mr McClean’s case it was said 
that he persisted in collapsing from the start and after a short time was not forcibly held up but allowed to lie on the floor.) Although a number of complainants alleged roughness and beatings, it was denied that any excessive

force was used to keep people in the posture or make them resume it. The 
staff was instructed, for example, to part legs not by kicking or hacking them but by pushing them outwards with the inner calf of their own legs. No-one was batoned to make him stay against the wall or was otherwise beaten whilst in the position. 63. 
In only one case was it necessary to use any considerable degree of 
physical constraint. This was the case of Mr Clarke, with which we deal below. In the other cases (though not, as mentioned, in that of Mr cClean) we were told that the atmosphere of rigid discipline was largely effective in its purpose, and, therefore, to enforce the posture any substantial degree of physical force was unnecessary and was not used. In the circumstances there had to be bodily contact between guards and detainees, but the guards had been specially trained to handle detainees by methods which avoided violence or physical damage. 64. 
We find from our inspection of the records kept at the time of this 
operation that the men were at the wall for periods totalling as follows:Mr Auld 
Mr Clarke 
Mr Donnelly Mr Hannaway Mr McClean 
Mr McGuigan Mr McKenna

in the required posture throughout. As stated above, the period of standing was 4 
6 hours at a time. At other times they would have been sitting against

1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the 
processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in manY Previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen Q.C. issued in November 1966 (Cmd 3165). 2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer. 
The following are prohibited: (i) 
Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. 
Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949)). 3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against 
Medical examination and record of weight of subject on admission and discharge.

The Compton Enquiry was appointed by the Home Secretary on 31 August to 
investigate allegations of physical brutality made by persons arrested on 9 August under the Special Powers Act. 
The Sunday Times article on 17 October, in dealing with the allegations 
of such persons who were specially interrogated, suggested that the terms of reference of the Compton Enquiry had been drafted with the intention of excluding them. The No 10 Statement of 18 October said that they were within the scope of the Enquiry. 
This statement was not made after any amendment or extension of the Enquiry’s 
original terms of reference. For the Home Secretary in his letter of appointment of 31 August specifically asked the Committee to investigate complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of persons who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them and told the Committee that the terms of reference had been drawn to include such persons. In fact, the Committee had already investigated several such allegations transmitted to them from other sources before the Sunday Times article of 17 October revealed that that newspaper held such allegations. 
A check of the 14 names mentioned in the Sunday Times article of 
17 October has established that 11 are persons arrested on 9 August. The Compton Committee on 19 October collected from the Sunday Times the information upon which that article was based, and that [insofar as it consists of allegations by persons arrested on 9 August,] it will be investigated and covered in the forthcoming Report. 
The Committee have received enquiries from the Press, Members of 
Parliament and other quarters as to whether they will now extend their investigation to include allegations of ill-treatment connected with the 3 other names in the Sunday Times article and a further 5 names mentioned by Mr Kevin MacNamara MP. 
The Committee has so far (Sunday, 24 October) avoided giving any answer. 
But what they want to say in reply is that they were appointed to investigate complaints from those arrested on 9 August; they have finished taking evidence

Mr. McNamara : I should like your the 
Compton Commission in Belfast to make available to it allegations which had been made about the mistreatment of prisoners in the various interrogation centres., I was was informed by the Secretary of the Commission that it had no pgwer to make inquiries about any person who was arrested and interrogated after,9th August. That means that the Commission ’ will not be able to investigate the cases of the 300 people who have.been arrested after that date. 
The Home Secretary said last Tuesday: 
" Intelligence is of enormous importance in defeating the gunmen, but despite that I repeat once again that allegations of this character must be fully investigated."-[OFFICIAL REPORT 19th October 1971 ; Vol. 823, c. 547.] Because of the apparent limitations 
which have been placed on the Commission, and because of the statement made to me this morning, may I ask whether the Home Secretary has indicated that he intends to come to the House this morning to make a statement about the limitations on the powers of the Commission? 
Mr. Speaker : I do not think that that 
is really a point of order. I shall carefully consider the preamble, but I am certain that the final conclusion is not a matter for me I shall consider whether there is a point of order, but I ha had no indication from the Home Secretary about his intending to make a statement.

on BALLYKELLY airfield in NORTHERN IRELAND from about 05.30 hours on Wednesday 11th August to 11.30 hours Tuesday 17th August. The operation dealt with the interrogation in depth of 12 IRA suspects. 
2. OPERATION CALABA was carried out by a Joint Team of Service and 
Police personnel. Representatives within the team and the numbers involved were: 
a. Joint Services Interrogation Wing (JSIW) personnel 
- 
(12) - Technical support and advice on all aspects of interrogation. 
b. RUC - Special Branch SB) 
(RUC - c. RUC - (RUC - 
Special Patrol Group SPG) 
(20) - All interrogations (26) - All internal 
guarding and all escort duties.

Essential Elements of Information (EEI)were not forthcoming initially from HQ RUC SB even though they had been requested by formal signal. In the event a decision was taken at 2100 hours Wednesday 11th August by OC SB Element and OC JSIW Element to decide on the following:- 
(1) 1st PRIORITY (2) 2nd PRIORITY (3) 3rd PRIORITY - - - Imminent enemy operations. 
Location of people, arms and explosives. 
Future enemy intentions. 
The above remained as EEI until 1900 hours 13th August when HQ RUC SB began to issue different items and priorities for interrogation. 
One successful operation to uncover arms caches was mounted 
direct from 25 CU between 2359 hours 14th August and 0830 hours 15th August 1971. This operation was mounted by HQ NI in conjunction with the local military and SB organisations. 
Co-operation Co-operation between the various elements of 25 CU was excellent. 
There was never the slightest difficulty in advising on the employment of the RUC personnel and it is without doubt that 25 CU operated as a complete team. The officers in charge of the RUC Elements deserve special mention; they were as follows:-

The EEI or targets for interrogation were by necessity 
issued by 25 CU in the initial phase. Recommendations The following recommendations were made:a. Early reconnaissance, acquisition and modification 
of new sites for interrogation should begin now because knowledge of the true function of HUT 60 is too widely held. Some of these new sites can be comparatively small and so cater for the individual high grade subject. 
b. The necessary procedures required by the internment 
orders should be carried out fully before the subject is offered for interrogation. It will assist considerably if the timing of such procedures is discussed with the interrogation organisation first so that collection of subjects can be co-ordinated. 
c. Only high grade subjects should be selected for 
interrogation in depth. There is no compulsion to fill 25 CU to its capacity of 12. As pointed out in Reference A the optimum is 6. 
d. EEI must be issued in advance of interrogation. 
Wherever possible they should be issued as main headings with all necess ary sub-headings also listed. 
The EEI may well vary according to the 
geographical area and may have to be issued separately for each. e. Although there was no great difficulty posed by the 
return of subjects to detention centres after this operation the problem must be studied. Wherever possible single accommodation should be available to allow subjects to re-enter and re-adjust to the larger community. This is especially relevant to those who co-operate fully under interrogation and even more to those who offer to or actively assist the Security Forces.

f. Operations of short duration should continue wherever 
possible. In this way security is more likely to be preserved and publicity prevented. The morale of the Joint Team will also benefit.

The Sunday Times allegations are covered by the terms of reference of 
Sir Edmund Compton’s inquiry; indeed, the terms of reference were specially framed for this purpose. (See letter of 31st August to Sir Edmund Compton of which Mr. Wilson can, if necessary, be given a copy). 
They read as follows:- 
"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". Allegations of the kind quoted in the Sunday Times have been brought to 
the notice of the Compton Inquiry, who have already carried out an investigation and will include the results in their forthcoming report. Six weeks ago the Inquiry asked the Sunday Times and other newspapers to furnish them with any evidence in their possession. They have accordingly taken note of the offer by the Editor of the Sunday Times, which has now, at last, been made, to furnish them with the full material on which yesterday’s report was based. As soon as this material is supplied to them, they will extend their Inquiry to deal with any matters which were not covered by the investigations which they have already made. If so, however, their report (which might otherwise be available early in November) may be a little delayed. When the report is available, it will be published, subject to whatever 
amendment or omission is required for security reasons. At that stage the Government would be prepared to inform the Leader of the Opposition, on the normal Privy Counsellor basis, of the amendments or omissions which had been made. 
Until the report is published the whole matter is, in a sense, sub 
judice; and it would therefore be both premature and improper for the Government to comment publicly on allegations which have appeared in the Press. But they are prepared to tell Mr. Wilson - again, on a Privy Counsellor basis - that the methods of interrogation which Ministers authorised in Northern Ireland are the same in principle as those which were employed in similar circumstances of organised terrorism 
- e. g. in Malaysia, Cyprus and 
Aden - and were last reviewed in 1967 in the light of the Bowen report on the Aden episode. As in all cases of this kind, it is naturally impossible to be sure that in the heat of the moment there may not have been some over severity in applying some of these accepted techniques in Northern Ireland. For further enlightenment on this point, we shall have to await the Compton report. But it is necessary to bear constantly in mind the overriding need

to sustain law and order in Northern Ireland and to protect both British troops and innocent civilians against ruthless and unscrupulous terrorism. For this purpose prompt intelligence is indispensable; and it would be unfair (to put it no more strongly) to our own Forces to forgo any permissible means of securing such intelligence.

NOTE FOR THE RECORD On the evening of 18 October 1971, Mr. Frank McManus, MP 
sent the Prime Minister a letter, a copy of which is attached to this note. Mr. McManus and Miss Devlin called at 10 Downing Street 
at about 7.30 p.m. on that evening. I explained that the Prime Minister was engaged and unable to see them. I said that he had received Mr. McManus’s letter. On the question of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Shannon, I sad that Mr. McManus had tabled questions for Written Answer in the House of Commons which would be answered in the normal way. The cases were being looked into. There was nothing which the Prime Minister could add at this stage. On the request that the Prime Minister should give a 
public undertaking that all forms of torture, disorientation and improper interrogation of detained persons in Northern Ireland should cease, I pointed out that any such undertaking would imply that the allegations which had been made were true. These allegations were under investigation by the Compton Committee, and were in that sense sub judice. The Government could not be expected to give undertakings which would imply that they accepted the allegations and would thus prejudge the results of the inquiry. Miss Devlin said that the allegations were not 
within the scope of the Compton Committee. I assured her that they were within the scope of the Compton Committee, as indeed the Prime Minister had assured the Leader of the Opposition at their meeting earlier in the evening.

Mr. McManus and Miss Devlin made it clear that they 
found these answers insufficient. Miss Devlin remarked that the inquiry was taking a very long time, since the events complained of had occurred ten weeks ago. 
I pointed out that this again prejudged that the inquiry would rind that the allegations had substance. Mr. McManus and Miss Devlin made it clear that they 
would be taking their stand on the pavement outside 10 Downing Street.

JONATHAN DIMBLEBY 18th October, 1971/0022 
INTERV. BRIAN FAULKNER EXTRACT FROM THE WORLDTTHIS WEEKEND OCTOBER 17th 
T.T.R. N.T.42/064 FAULKNER: 
made it very clear that the police force and the army are their prime targets. 
results. 
Well there’s nothing new in this of course, the IRA have remember during the past eighteen months they have made 
several murderous attacks upon policemen. It looks an though, over the past two days, they have definitely sought out police targets. they have been cowardly attacks and, in two cases, with tragic 
But this is something that the men of the RUC have quite literally faced at intervals for the last fifty years. In my view they’re the bravest police force in the world and in fact, judging by their activities especially ever the last few months, perhaps one of the most effective and efficient. 
DIMBLEBY: FAULKNER: Do you think that there will be, as a result of the 
last few attacks which seem to have increased in concentration, that there will be demands that they should be re-armed? 
No I don’t believe that this will make any difference at all to the attitude of the men in the RUC. They do carry arms when 
they are engaged in duties where it is thought that the arms are necessary for their protection. For instance the two police officers who were shot dead in Belfast on Friday afternoon were carrying arms, and of course didn’t have the opportunity to use them at all. 
DIMBLEBY: If there were demands, perhaps from your own Party, that 
the police in general should be re-armed, would you refuse them? FAULKNER: 
I will never be swayed in an way by political pressure 
whether from my own Party or elsewhere on security matters, I’ve made this clear all alone, whether it relates to internment or to arming of the police or whatever, but I will be guided absolutely by the Chief Constable of the Loyal Ulster Constabulary on this matter, I will always seek his advice, and there certainly will be no qualms on my part about agreement from the Northern Ireland Government that the RUC should carry arms as and when it’s regarded that they should do se by the Chief Constable and I don’t think I’m stretching it at all to say that the United Kingdom Government would hold similar views to mine on that.

THE ARMY is determined thh’. this phase of its battle with’the IRA shall remain secret. The official inquiry under Sir Edmund Compton, now looking 
into 
allegations of brutality towards detainees, was given terms of reference specifically designel-according to a high military, source-to prevent its inquiring into these interrogation techniques. For Compton can only inquire into brutality " prior .. to their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order." This phrase relates of Regular 
tion 11, paragraph 2, of the Special Powers Act-which lays down that the detention order, signed by the Minister of Home Affairs, must refer to a specific 
i i 
t 
place of detention. So far as we can tell, all those 
later taken to the Barracks hat not only been served with such detention order-but had also, however tr a ns ie ntly, been 
" lodged " in the place specified. The catch is that they were 
then served with another document--this one signed personally by Brian Faulkner, Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs. [The detention order merely had his rubber-stamp signature.] The second document allowed them to be movedunder Regulation 11, Section 5to "any place where his presence is required in the interests of justice." The place was the interrogation centre at Palace Barracks. So anxious was the Army to 
keep the affair legal within the terms of the Special Powers Act that a few men were flown back to their place 
handed the movement order, and then flown for a second time to Palace Barracks-1his time, for thorough inierrogation. But the fact of anilKal first journey in several case imay be the loophole under which, should he choose, Sir Edmund Compton could look into the afPjr

NORTHERN IRELAND: INQUIRY INTO ALLEGATIONS OF BRUTALITY 
The Prime Minister spoke this morning to 
Sir Edmund Compton on the telephone and persuaded him to take part in the inquiry into allegations of brutality arising from the internment operation. Sir Edmund said that he would need to be assured 
that the inquiry which he was carrying out for Lord Balniel on Defence Medical Services could be suspended until this more urgent task was completed. The Prime Minister said that he would arrange for this to be done. He would also clear the appointment with Mr. Faulkner, in view of Sir Edmund’s capacity as Parliamentary Commissioner for Northern Ireland and with the Secretary of State for the Environment, whom he would be seeing at Worcester, in view of Sir Edmund’s forthcoming work on local government boundaries. The Prime Minister explained that there would 
be two other members, a lawyer and a doctor. Sir Edmund suggested that Mr. Owen Stable, Q.C., would be a good choice. The Prime Minister undertook to pursue this. The Prime Minister asked Sir Edmund whether he 
would be willing to preside over the inquiry. Sir Edmund said that he had thought that the three members could work together, but he would be willing to preside if the Prime Minister wanted this. The Prime Minister undertook to let him know.

The Prime Minister said that he wanted the 
membership of the inquiry to be announced and the work to start as soon as possible. 
But before an 
announcement was made, Sir Edmund would need to be briefed by the Home Office. Sir Edmund said that he hoped to be back in London by tomorrow evening, and would make contact with Sir Philip Allen. He hoped to be available to start work next week. I passed all this to Sir Philip Allen on the 
telephone and he undertook to carry out the action promised by the Prime Minister.

PRIME MINISTER This is the Home Office advice on the suggestion you 
made at Chequers: The suggestion which the Prime Minister raised at the 
meeting at Chequers yesterday that there might be a quick inquiry into allegations of brutality in Northern Ireland undertaken by a lawyer and a doctor has been further pursued with the GOC and Mr. Faulkner. 
The GOC would warmly welcome an inquiry of this kind; 
Mr. Faulkner also thinks it could be useful and agrees that the RUC should be included. 
The proposed terms of reference are:"To investigate the evidence relevant to the allegations 
made by, or on behalf of, those arrested under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 on 9 August about their treatment while in the custody of the Security Forces prior to either their subsequent release, the serving of a detention order or the preferring of a criminal charge." The Ministry of Defence would like it to be said that 
this inquiry was being undertaken at the request of the GOC ANd the formula which might be used could be: "The GOC Northern Ireland, in his capacity as Director of Operations (this brings in the RUC), with the full concurrence of the Northern Ireland Government, has requested, etc." A statement giving the terms of reference will give rise 
to immediate pressure for the names, but it seems better, particularly in the light of press reporting in the course of today, to get a holding statement out as soon as possible, perhaps in time for the Sunday press rather than wait until persons have been found willing and suitable to serve. Presumably the statement should be issued by the Minister 
of Defence. Lord Balniel agrees at all points. Do you agree the action proposed?

IF MR. LYNCH ENQUIRES HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE LORD

THIS WOULD IN ANY CASE BE POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE BUT EVEN IF IT WERE NOT IT WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL THE DIFFICULTIES ABOUT THE INTIMIDATION OF WITNESSES AND REPRISALS ETC. WHICH OBLIGED STORMONT TO RESORT TO INTERNMENT RATHER THAN TRIALS. YOU SHOULD AVOID GETTING INTO A DISCUSSION OF MR. HAROLD WILSON’S SPEECH.

2. If Mr. Lynch enquires how long it will be before 
lord Parker’s Committee reports, you should say that you do not know. The reason is that there has been a delay in constituting it as a result of the failure of the Labour Party so far to nominate a Privy Councillor to take part. You should discourage any suggestion that Mr. Lynch may make for an independent tribunal to investigate allegations. This would in any case be politically unacceptable but even if it were not it would be open to all the difficulties about the intimidation of witnesses and reprisals etc. which obliged Stormont to resort to internment rather than trials. 
You should avoid getting into a discussion 
of Mr. Harold Wilson’s speech. Ministers will no doubt be considering his proposals but in view of the decision of the Opposition to divide the House when the debate resumes on Monday in terms which in parts appear to contradict points made by Mr. Wilson, it is not at present clear exactly what his proposals amount to. Any comment which Ministers feel a b 1 e to make will be contained in speeches made during the course of the debate.

20th August 1971 Mr 
Old Hall, Brampton, Becles, Suffolk. 
ier, M.P,, 
Dear Mr. Prior, I have continued to do what I can to emphasize to Mr. Lynch 
the goodwill of Mr. Heath and his colleagues. If I may, however, there are one or two points which I feel I should make. 
Mr. Lynch is very much a man of peace and has, as you know, 
kept to this policy under, at times, very difficult conditions. There would appear to be some feeling in Britain that it might have been possible for him to introduce internment in the South. It is not, I think, fully realised, just how strong a shift in public opinion is taking place in the South. Far from taking steps against Northern republicans he is instead in a situation where any aid or assistance to them would be widely welcomed in the South. There is a very definite tide flowing, the strength of which it would be easy to underestimate. This tide is in favour of aid to the Nationalists in the North. 
At one time it would have been fair to say that the over- 
whelming weight of opinion in the South was against any form of serious support for the Nationalists or Republicans in the North. Among the older section of the population this may still, to some extent, be the case, but not among the general populace. 
Such currents of opinion, once under way, are very difficult 
to reverse. I cannot help feeling that the very real dangers of a Protestant backlash in the North have been allowed to obscure the far greater danger of a Catholic or Nationalist reaction both North and South. There is, in my opinion, a very real danger that affairs in Ulster will gradually slide, against the wishes of

affecting Britain and the Republic, including the E.E.C. that Northern Ireland would be one of the subjects 
discussed, as it would be disingenuous to pretend otherwise. The Prime Minister agrees with the Home Secretary’s 
view, recorded in your letter of 21 April that, before the meeting with Mr Lynch, we should need to be as clear as possible about what we should wish to obtain from the meeting. He agrees that officials should now provide an assessment of what the objective should

explain such tougher measures as we might have it in mind to take (for example, on the border and on internment) so that, if and when these measures were taken, Mr. Lynch would understand the background and would be less likely to react adversely. But the main purpose would be to find out what Mr. Lynch thought that he might be able to do to deal with the I.R.A., bearing in mind that the last outbreak was solved mainly by action in the Republic, and that effective action south of the border would lessen the need for more drastic measures north of the border.
