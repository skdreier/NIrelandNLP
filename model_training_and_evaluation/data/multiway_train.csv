"Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches.
