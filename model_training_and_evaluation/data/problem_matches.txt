Positive sentence: Paragraph (b) of the Army letter envisages that persons may be arrested under Regulation 10 "for purposes of questioning prior to preferment of criminal charges". I am uncertain whether an arrest for such purposes would properly be within the powers confferred by Regulation 10. When we redrafted the main policy document, our main object was to preserve the powers of arrest under Regulation 11(1); these powers contemplate that persons so arrested could, in certain circumstances, be brought before the courts and the powers of arrest relate to any person whom the arresting officer "suspects of acting or of having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order" and so on.

the point the Secretary of State has made that he would be prepared to consider signing interim custody orders against any Protestants who were arrested on the basis of their possible implication in murder but against whom it was not possible to prefer charges.

7. Regulation 11. This is chiefly used when a person is suspected of 
having committed an offence in the field of law and order but there is a brook in time between the alleged commission of the offence and the apprehension of the suspect. The appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card must be used. Additionally persons in the following categories are to be arrested under Regulation 11 powers:- 
a. Anyone against hom there is known to be evidence to 
justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which 
might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged 
consideration will be given to 
a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient 
c. Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional 
IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. d.

Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red-handed" 
(see paragraph 3 above) if the arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial to peace. 
8. Soldiers may wish to question a passer-by, e.g. as to his identity 
and recent activities, even though his behaviour gives no grounds for suspicion. This is permissible if it is done on the spot or very close by and the questions are reasonable. There is no power to require a person to leave the immediate area and go to a military post for this questioning unless he is lawfully arrested. If an answer is given which causes the soldier to suspect the person of falling into one of the categories in paragraph 7 above, he should arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA, remembering to use the appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card. If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately.

This category was construed as referring to some 200 persons who might be regarded as holding offier status.

Positive sentence: 2. The main change is that the current powers of arrest under Regulations 10 and 11 under the Special Powers Act remain both valid and usable by soldiers, albeit sparingly. The Blue Card therefore also remains valid in its entirety and Paragraph One of Reference B is cancelled.

5. Propaganda. Following the death of Spr STEWART in the Four Square Laundry incident, our concern was to convince public opinion that this had been a highly successful operation in spite of its tragic ending, and that plain clothes surveillance operations by the Army were legitimate and valuable to the maintenance of security and ought to be continued. The IRA are anxious to portray such activities as ’SAS’ or ’Army assassination squads’ and to discredit them generally in the hope that public opinion will force HMG to discontinue them. One week after the event British public opinion seemed to be in our favour. Whilst Republicans continue to resent our plain clothes patrols, their confidence may have suffered as a result of them. However, further propaganda attacks will undoubtedly continue on this theme. 
6. In an apparently unauthorised release to the media the UDA claim to have raided an IRA base South of the border in Co MONAGHAN and to have captured weapons and explosives. Their Inner Council subsequently met, ostensibly to decide whether or not to hand the weapons over, but more likely to consider how to escape the embarrassment of an unfounded claim.

Security Forces in hard-core areas and five soldiers have been injured in these attacks. Following the killing on 2 October of a soldier engaged on a plain clothes patrol there has been a reaction from both factions of the IRA and from other Republican organisations. The Provisional IRA boasted responsibility for the murder and claimed that the operation had been under surveillance for some time. In a later statement on 5 October they claimed incorrectly to have shot not one but five agents on the same day, three in the laundry van and two others in the Antrim Road. Hooliganism continues including the stoning of a bus which caused the death of an innocent bystander on Tuesday. 
The majority of the 128 shooting incidents have again comprised sniping at 9. 
there are indications that one was a UDA murder of a suspected supplier of guns to the IRA, and one was a Provisional IRA murder probably through mistaken identity. 
Three civilians have been killed in unexplained shootings in the week, of these

1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the 
processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen Q.C. issued in November 1966 (Cmd 3165). 2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer. 
The following are prohibited: (i) 
Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. 
Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949 3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the. key to successful operations

a. The security problem, both in GB and NI especially concerning the move of reinforcements and briefing of RUC 
b. The PR Line, accepting that the opposition have had ample warning to prepare every form of international opposition to internment without trial; and the need to make STORMONT realise their responsibilities in internment. 
c.. The cover plan for the actual op, and the selection of a code word. 
d. The mechanics of the operation 
(i) What is said to the wanted person at the time of arrest? 
(2) The time allowed for a person to make really important domestic arrangements before being taken away. 
(3) The action to be taken in the event of wanted persons attempting to escape. 
(4) The action to be taken if the locals stop the security forces arresting the wanted persons and rioting takes place. 
(5)What action is to be taken if only a very small number of wanted persons are arrested?

We have heard that the IRA deliberately intend to allow an internee with a dangerous heart complaint to be arrested. What medical screening is planned to prevent an immediate complaint of murder or callousness etc?

Detention and Internment 
The power of internment is contained in Regulation 12 made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts (Northern Ireland) 1922-43, 
The power to 
intern is such criticised and is inconsistent with the European Human Rights Convention; a notice of derogation was lodged in 1957. 
The powers contained 
in Regulation 12 were last used during the IRA campaign against Northern Ireland front 1956-62. 2. 
is called for - to release, withan a period of about 7 days. 
in-point at present. 3. 
Regulation 11 confers powers of deention and in practice further action to intern or to charge under criminal legislation It is not thought that these powers are much 
whether he was contemplating the use of internment powers. 
Before his resignation Major Chichester-Clark was asked from time to time The standard reply 
which he evolved was that his security advisers - the GOC and the Chief Constable- 
did not recommend it at the time, but if they were to recommend it he would not hesitate to act. Since he succeeded as northern Ireland Prime Minister Mr Faulkner has confirmed that this is his view on the introduction of internment. The Northern Ireland Government has a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before making a final decision. 
of internment lay in the hands of the Northern Ireland Government. 
Mr Heath said in Edinburgh on 27 arch that the power It had 
often been stated by Stormont spokesmen, he said, that such measures as internment can only be taken if the Joint Security Committee advises it, but Mr Heath said his Government had never been asked to sanction such a measure. 4. 
On 4 December 1970 the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice of the Irish 
Republic issued a statement about their readiness to reactivate powers of internment without trial in the Republic because of information about plans for a secret armed conspiracy. 
The statement added that the Republic also had 
lodged a notice of derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention on human Rights. 
But little has been heard from the Republic of any steps to carry out the threat or of the alleged plot behind the move. 

Positive sentence: 2. Regulation 11 conferes powers of detention and in practice further action is called for - to release, to intern or to charge under criminal legislation - within a period of about 7 days. It is not thought that these powers are much in point at present.

Internment is a hideous step to have to take, but it is no more hideous than a campaign of murder. Therefore, we should assess whether it would make a contribution to the cessation of the campaign.

The BBC and Northern Ireland 9. It seems that the BBC had got themselves into the position where 
whatever official discouragement they encountered, they felt too far committed to their debate programme on Northern Ireland to be able to drop it. This is perhaps because their top management gave premature approval for the programme, without first satisfying themselves that it was sensibly conceived 
- and thus, without realising that much of 
the punning for it was inept. It does not seem likely to be a very successful production. 10. Mr. Michael Charlton has tentatively proposed that "Panorama" should make a programme - 
mainly in Northern Ireland - on the subject 
of urban guerrilla warfare. He envisages that the programme would include interviews with the GOC and perhaps other Army commanders in the Province. (He mentioned interviewing Brigadier Kitson, but it would probably not be in that officer’s own interest to be given further prominence as a counter-insurgency expert while he is still serving in northern Ireland.) Charlton also envisages including interview 
- which he guarantees would be hostile - with a 1eading 
meber of the IRA, south of the border. 11. This programe holds promise of being helpful in bringing out the squalor and criminality of the IRA; and there may be advantage in seen to be willing to co-operate with the BBC when they are trying to make a responsible programme. "Panorama"

Positive sentence: Assume the military success is scored, what then? The advice that comes from Stormont is that in those circumstances, with intimidation lifted and lawful authority restored, the near-insurrection of large sections of the Roman Catholic community would come to an end. Constitutional politics could begin again, consent would be forthcoming, the corpus of legislative reform undertaken in the last two years would work through into the social system to everyone's benefit, consultations for institutional change could be begun on the lines indicated in Mr. Faulkner's Green Paper of October, and--in a word--normal service could be resumed.

Positive sentence: But, as the GOC emphasised to the Home Secretary yesterday, it would be greatly preferable to avoid any releases based simply on expediency and concentrate instead on creating proper arrangements for categorising the internees, attempting to rehabilitate the more amenable among them and releasing those who really seem ready for it.

Positive sentence: And accompanying that activity - the bombing, the shooting, the intimidation - has been an utterly unscrupulous propaganda campaign. This has been designed to spread the notion that if we had not interned, everything would now be quite peaceful: Or that if we were to bring internment to an end, that would rapidly guarantee a return to peaceful conditions; and that in the meantime internment has been the great 'recruiting sergeant for the IRA'. "The time has surely come to demonstrate what [cant] all of this is. Was the situation before internment getting better?

the terrorists would be rendered ineffective despite continuing access to arms. 
What has to be decided 
is whether to rely entirely on this indirect means of neutralising them or whether to rely on more direct means. 
those who are taken in for interrogation, or some of them at any rate, are kept in custody 
internment. Without the prospect that at least some 
of those interrogated would be interned, the process of interrogation would be unlikely to succeed. 
14. If it were agreed that the need to keep potential terrorists out of circulation outweighed the political penalties of doing so, the security forces could attempt in the course of the operation to arrest all those reliably believed to be members of the Provisional 
- and 
possibly the Official IRA, depending on their reactions as well as those reliably believed to be organisers of Protestant para-military activity. 
roughly estimated that up to 400 extremists would be arrested on the first day of the operation and some 50 a day during the ensuing two weeks - 
by the end of 
which it is expected that there would be roughly up to 1500 IRA members in custody (ie the 2000 known activists less those who had escaped or had been killed while offering resistance in the early stages) and perhaps 100 Protestants. 
This estimate of up to 1600 does not include the 300-odd at present interned. Special steps 
would obviously have to be taken, in that case, to provide adequate accommodation and staffing for their continuing custody and also the custody of those to be charged with offences. 
It is difficult to see how this could be done 
without removing a large number of convicted prisoners upwards of 1000 - from the prisons and camps in Northern Ireland to prisons in Britain. 
15. A compromise (which would rovide the sanction needed to support interrogation but would have much less effect in keeping terrorists out of circulation) would be to keep in custody a much smaller number (say 300) comprising the most important organisers of subversion and the most dangerous gunmen and bombers. 
Legal Powers for the Security Forces 
16. Most of the powers which the security forces are expected to recuire for the implementation of this plan are already available under the Special Powers Regulations. The additional powers which the Army itself would wish to have are considered in Annex C. 
17. But, however comprehensive the specific powers that 
are available, it will be inherent in the nature of the operation that individual members of the security forces will be faced even more than usual with taking instant decisions on whether and how to act (eg whether to open fire) and it is thought essential, if the security forces are not to be seriously inhibited, that such decisions should be taken without the fear of their legality 
In that case, it is 
On the answer to this question depends whether - detention and

General Election which was announced on 5 February and held on 28 February. Contrary to expectations, it was fought largely on domestic issues rather than the Northern Ireland situation. The final result was:

It will become clear(once the Bill is passed) that detention procedures are temporary and that, given an end to the appalling conditions which make them necessary, they will be allowed to lapse. H.M. Government have no intention of keeping these provisions in force a moment longer than is necessary. 

Positive sentence: The Government would greatly prefer it if the ordinary criminal procedures were effective in bringing these people to justice, but the findings of the Diplock Commission were that they are not and cannot be so effective under present conditions in Northern Ireland.

5. On the strictly security side, the withdrawal of all but three battalions 
from Belfast to the country-side has contributed to a greater appearance of normality in the city, while the Army’s growing success in uncovering arms caches is a source of general satisfaction to the law-abiding; and as the Army edges itself back towards the barracks, the morale of the R.U.C. continues to improve. They have a very long way to go before they earn the full confidence of the minority, but the process has begun.

Minister, in public at least, has not put a foot wrong in the matter. He re-itera 
that if he is advised by his security advisers that internment is necessary, he is prepared to intern. 
At the same time he indicates that this situation has not yet The police at present are firmly of the opinion that internment would be 
counter-productive, since they believe that however many I.R.A. men were picked up, others would come forward in their places. 
In my own view (and Father Murphy has 
volunteered a like opinion) the real extremists would welcome the introduction of internment. 
It would reverse the process of their isolation from the general 
Catholic population and the insurrectionary atmosphere of last summer would be recreated. 
In this over-long letter, I have painted an optimistic picture, but the circumstances as they exist at this moment warrant mild optimism.

INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
the Chief Constable - Major Chichester-Clark has been publicly asked from time to time 
in recent months whether he is contemplating internment. The standard reply which he has evolved is that his security advisers 
- to recommend it he would not hesitate to act. the GOC and 
do not recommend it at present, but if they were This is not an entirely 
satisfactory formula in that it might be read as an abdication by the Prime Minister of political responsibility for the decision. Home Office doubts on this score have been conveyed privately to the Secretary to the Cabinet and it is known that both the former GOC and the present Chief Constable feel that they are being publicly placed in a somewhat invidious position. There is however a clear and firm understanding between the two governments, frequently renewed and kept in good repair, that there could be no question of internment being adopted without full consultation with HMG. 
2. If internment were thought necessary the Northern Ireland Government 
would be in considerable practical difficulties. The advice of the security forces is that the numbers involved would be something between 350 and 450. 
There is no suitable prison building which could be 
used. The main prison in Belfast is full, and anyway being in the Crumlin Road is in an area which would present serious additional security problems. The only other prison in Northern Ireland, in Armagh, could only hold a fraction of the numbers 
- perhaps 80 - is dangerously near 
the border and in a part of the town which makes it particularly difficult to guard. High turrets completely bullet proof would have to be erected inside the prison and despite their protection would be a perpetual target for snipers. 
3. Internment camps could be got ready elsewhere in Northern Ireland 
notably in Rathlin Island, off the north coast, but the preparations would be obvious and their purpose clear. The consequent effect on the political and security situation would be most damaging, notwithstanding the statements made by Mr Lynch about his willingness to use similar powers in the south if necessary. 
4. In December 1970 in a period of comparative calm the Northern 
Ireland Government suddenly asked through the United Kingdom Government representative whether emergency contingency plans could be put in hand to make HMS MAIDSTONE, anchored in Belfast Lough, available as a place of detention for internees. HMS MAIDSTONE is a former submarine depot ship at present used to provide accommodation for troops. Both the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary found this proposition unattractive. The idea was somewhat too sensational and would immediately invite comparison with the hulks and would no doubt prove more photogenic than a prison or a barbed wire camp. 
5. As the Cabinet has recently noted, a decision to inter would need the most careful consideration. It is the view of the GOC and of the Chief Constable that even if all known activists were picked up, others at present unknown would immediately step into their place and recruitment to the IRA generally would receive further impetus.

detain will at the same time announce that all marches

Positive sentence: Despite the considerable success of the internment operation and the possibility that it will in time bring terrorism under control, the bombing has not abated and the mood of the country is very bad and getting worse.

Positive sentence: Another argument, which I still believe to have been a strong one, was that in July there were clear signs of a Protestant mood to take matters into their own hands and deal with the Catholics themselves. This mood is reviving.

in the fact that those who use or advocate violence destroy the prospects of peaceful co-operation in this direction. Let us by clear that the I.R.A. have already deprived the community 
in Northern Ireland of certain elementary rights. People in areas where the I.R.A. is most active have been ruthlessly intimidated. those areas fear daily the risk of bring struck down. People outside A government as the 
same duty to protect its citizens from an internal enemy as it has to protect them from an external enemy in time of war and those who oppose the rights of the individual should also consider the rights of society as a whole. I have exercised powers of internment with the greatest possible 
reluctance, a reluctance shared by all my colleagues as well as by Her Majesty’s Government in London. 
But I have made no Internment Order without 
being satisfied on evidence placed before me that the person concerned was and still is an active member of the Official or Provisional Wing of the I.R.A. or has been closely implicated in the recent I.R.A. campaign. 
Amongst those 
now interned are over 80 officers of the Official and Provisional Wing of the I.R.A. 
political views or because oppose the Government. Persons who may be members of the Civil Rights 
Movement or the People’s Democracy, or of other organisation, are being interned only if they are also members of the I.R.A. or actively involved in it. 
Members of various organisations who have been associated in one way or 
another with the I.R.A. are not included where I am not satisfied that they are sufficiently deeply implicated and committed to violence to justify their being interned. 
as before within the limits of the law. 
Anyone in Northern Ireland is as free to express his views The only reason anyone is interned 
is that he belongs to, and has actively supported, an organisation which advocated and uses violence for political ends. 

Positive sentence: It is because of such involvement that persons are being held and not because of their political views or because they oppose the Government.

Positive sentence: 1. Ministers here have agreed that the date now agreed for a tripartite summit means that it would hardly be possible to defer making internment orders until after the meeting. As far as we are concerned, therefore, the way is clear for the making of orders as soon as you have your appeal committee appointed.

Positive sentence: 2. In the discussion which I had with your prime minister, which I have reported to ministers here, it was agreed that internment orders would only be made in respect of persons who there are reasonable grounds for thinking are actively associated with one or other branch of the IRA - or, if any such are subsequently detained, members of any other terrorists organisations.

Accomodation: There are 40 men at present accommodated in huts originally planned for 34, but only parts of the camp have been completed and it is expected that with the completion of further building work in a fortnight's time this position will be relieved. 2. Cooking: Cooking is not done by electricity but by [] gas and the use of search lights therefore has no effect on the power available in the cook-hours; but there are electric hotplates in the mess halls and these developed a fault yesterday which was put right today. 3. Bunks: These are standard army issue. 4. Clothing: Internees were allowed to bring with them all the clothing they had in their possession. Those who wish to obtain a change of clothes can do so by having other garments brought in by relations or friends; alternatively if this is not possible clothing is issued to them. 5. Books: They were allowed to take in with them books they alread possessed and further supplies are being provided at Long Kesh as soon as possible. 75 newspapers are being provided free of charge daily.

FAULKNER COMMENDED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE QUOTE NATIONALISTS UNQUOTE DID NOT WANT IT.) 
3. I ASKED WHAT PADDY DEVLIN HAD IN MIND WHEN HE SUGGESTED LAST FRIDAY THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH TALKING TO BOAL AND PAISLEY. HUME SAID THAT THE FACT WAS THAT THEY REPRESENTED PROTESTANT WORKING CLASU OPINION IN A WAY IN WHICH MR FAULKNER DID NOT AND THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SOME CONTACT FOR THAT REASON ALONE. HE WAS NOT SURE HOWEVER THAT THIS CONTACT WOULD BE MADE. THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF THE MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES WORKING WITH PAISLEY AND BOAL, AND IF THEY SHOULD EVER COME TO POWER THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MINOKITY AND THE MAJORITY WOULD BECOME DANGEROUSLY SHARPER. HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TO ALLOW THEM TO COME TO POWER. 
COURT TO SIT WITHOUT JURY UNDER A JUDGE WHO COMMANDED THE RESPECT OF THE MINORITY. HE SUGGESTED O’DONNELL WHO WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED TO THE HIGH COURT. AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR CONVERSATION HE STUCK TO THE VIEW THAT THE COURT SHOULD SIT IN PUBLIC, THAT THE DEFENDENTS SHOULD BE LEGALLY REPRESENTED IN COURT AND A CROSS EXAMINATION SHOULD BE ALLOWED. I TOLD HIM THAT I COULD HOLD OUT NO PROSPECT OF THE PRESENT ARRANGEMNENTS BEING CHANGED BUT THAT I WAS PREPARED TO DISCUSS HIS IDEAS ON A THEORETICAL BASIS. TO BEGIN WITH A TRIAL IN OPEN COURT AND A CROSS EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES BY LAWYERS WAS IN MY OPINION QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION. I SAID I THOUGHT I NEED HARDLY EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHY THIS WAS SO. MIGHT IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE HOWEVER IF IN ADDITION TO THE JUDGES, TWO OBSERVERS SHOULD BE PRESENT, CHOSEN WITH THE APPROVAL OF MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES. I ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF PERSONAL THREAT IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD THING TO CHOOSE THESE OBSERVERS FROM PEOPLE IN THE PROVINCE , BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE POSSIBLE TO FIND ACCEPTABLE PEOPLE IN BRITAIN. HUME SHOWED SOME INTEREST IN THIS IDEA (WHICH I TOLD HIM HAD OCCURRED TO ME ONLY SINCE WE HAD SPOKEN ON THE TELEPHONE THE DAY BEFORE) AND I THOUGHT THAT HIS INSISTENCE ON TRIAL IN OPEN COURT WITH CROSS EXAMINATION WEAKENED IN THE LIGHT OF IT. I SAID THAT WHILE I WAS VERY HAPPY TO TALK WITH HIM, HUME WOULD DO MUCH BETTER TO TALK WITH THE HOME SECRETARY. I BELIEVED THAT IF HE DID SO THERE WOULD BE NO OBJECTION TO INTERNMENT BEING THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA, OR INDEED THE ONLY ONE, ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT FIND THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PASS ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS AS WELL. FOR OUR PART, SUCH A MEETING COULD BE ENTIRELY PRIVATE AND WE WOULD DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT NEWS OF IT DID NOT GET OUT. HUME SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS, AND WONDERED WHETHER, IF A MEETING COULD BE ARRANGED, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO COME ALONE OR WITH HIS COLLEAGUES. I SAID THIS WAS FOR HIM TO DECIDE BUT I THOUHGHT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR A FIRST MEETING ALONE . 
HE SAID HE THOUGHT SO TOO, AND HE ALSO 
THOUGHT THAT IF HE DECIDED TO GO HE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE UP HIS MIND WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS COLLEAGUES. HE WOULD LET ME KNOW BY MONDAY EVENING WHAT HE HAD DECIDED. 
5. I THINK HUME VERY MUCH WANTS TO HAVE A TALK WITH MR MAUDLNG AND THAT THERE IS JUST A CHANCE THAT HE WILL PLUCK UP COURAGE AND ASK FOR ONE. 
SMITH
