THE BEST METHOD OF ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE IS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_55')

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland sent 
Sir Burke Trend a copy of his minute to the Prime Minister of today about Regulation 24A of the Special Powers Act.	('PREM_15_1015', 'IMG_8373')

POSSIBLE STATEMENT OF POLICY ON ARRESTS 1. 
The following should be arrested if the opportunity arises: (a) 
anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to justify the preferring of criminal charges;	('CJ_4_251', 'IMG_1759')

OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 4. 
Violence has continued to be at a relatively low level, but casualties to the security forces remain serious.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9752')

If that could be agreed with the Northern Ireland Government, the initiative on this subject could then take the form of an announcement that licencing was in future going to be conducted more restrictively; that anyone who felt he could dispense with his firearms was therefore urged to hand them in; and that anyone handing in an unlicensed firearm - within a very limited period 
- would be immune from 
prosecution for having possessed it illegally.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6575')

The public emergenc es in which alone we are concerned.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_1944')

SCOTLAND YARD DETECTIVES RETURN 
19. Newspapers reported the return to London of the Scotland Yard detectives, led by Detective Chief Inspector Peyton, (HONIP(71) 7 paragraph 20). The official announcement simply said that their inquiries had reached the stage when their presence was no longer necessary but many newspapers speculated that the known murderers were irretrievably in the Irish Republic.	('PREM_15_479', 'IMG_5840')

The disadvantage is that the general rules governing the conduct of interrogation already offer the detainee substantial safeguards against wrongful treatment and it is difficult to see how they can be relaxed any further without bringing about a situation in which the restrictions on the interrogator would be such that effective interrogation would become virtually impossible.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2311')

A detained person who wishes to vary or supplement the iiieals provided may do so at his own expense or the expense of his friends; subject, however, to 
(a) any directions given on medical grounds by the 
Medical Officer; (b) the same limitation upon the supply of alcoholic 
liquor as apply in the cases of prisoners awaiting trial, viz.:	('PREM_15_484', 'IMG_6314')

Some of this May I leave it to you to commission such further 
work as may be required?	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1908')

Extra personnel for interrogation 8. 
At MOD’s request the Home Office are considering how best to 
approach the Metropolitan Police to explore whether volunteers might be forthcoming from that force for secondement to Northern Ireland to assist the RUC Special Branch with the interrogation of wanted persons when they are at police holding centres just after arrest.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6724')

The need thus to reinforce the warder staff in Northern Ireland, and to stiffen it with some extra experience, remains very urgent if the capacity for accommodating internees and detainees is not to fall too far behind the rate of arrests and internments implicit in the present concept of operations. So far it has not been necessary to halt arrests, but they are having to be	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6492')

If the march is not

We did have a responsible

The reference to "membership of an illegal organisation" is, however, unhappy since strictly no such arrest should properly be made under Regulation 11. The object of the wording is possibly to refer obliquely to Regulation 24(A) 
- but this regulation is, as I understand it, 
much observed in the breach as a result of rather perverse decision of the courts recently that membership of the Provisional wing did not constitute membership of the IRA. If the letter of 28 June is to be redrafted, I think it better to omit the words "and not simply membership of an illegal organisation".	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1871')

I am to say that it is the wish of the Government of Northern 
Ireland to end internment as soon as possible.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4974')

The Government may issue a Suppression Order against any organisation it deems unlawful; it is then unlawful for any person to be a member of that organisation, and the property of the organisation is forfeit to the Minister for Justice.	('PREM_15_1002', 'IMG_6733')

The Government’s response to the report 4. 
Once the Compton Committee’s report is published the 
Government will be expected to say not only whether it accepts its findings but also what changes, if any, are to be made to the rules governing the conduct of interrogation in the light of the report’s findings.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2310')

There were three shooting incidents and seven bomb hoaxes.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6494')

The advice is that provided the number of internees does not exceed this level, and proper arrangements are made to keep them under surveillance, then they should not be able maliciously to damage the ship to any serious extent; nor should they be able, by their own folly, to put at risk other internees.

PEACE PROPOSAlS 
The leadership of the Republican Movement wishes to state that the following conditions are considered necessary to secure peace in the present conflict between British and Irish forces: 
I. A declaration of intent from the British Government to withdraw its forces from our country along with an immediate cessation of all British Army activity in the North.	('PREM_15_1004', 'IMG_7083')

In a shooting incident in the New Lodge a soldier sustained a flesh wound and at 0007 hrs in the New Lodge, in a shooting incident not involving SF,John Flood (RC, no trace) was seriously wounded in the back.	('PREM_15_1016', 'IMG_8476')

something which it might be helpful to talk about/to the Opposition front bench in confidence. 3. Although the Government would not wish to appear to be holding back on their agreement in principle to talks, the Opposition front bench must recognise: (a) the danger in a number of likely topics of participitating direct rule unintentionally, for example, by driving Mr Faulkner to a position where he has to withdraw or resign,

The Home Secretary raised with 
Mr. Faulkner at their recent meeting the possibility of improving these procedures, e. g. by giving an internee a written statement of the allegation against him; by considering appeals in two stages, with legal representation at one but not at the other; and by enlarging the Appeals Committee in order to accelerate the hearings.

9. Finally, the meeting should perhaps take note of the position as 
regards direct rule, including the Home Secretary’s recommendation (in the minute which he set you yesterday) that there is no realistic alternative to planning on this basis that the majority of the Northern Ireland public service would remain basically loyal.	('PREM_15_482', 'IMG_6210')

prison accommodation outside Great Britain; and the Department of the Environment could not act as agents for them, or for any other body, without there being proper and legitimate authority so to do.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2254')

NORTHER GENERAL 
1. IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 110700 TO 120700 HRS SEP 72 The period was generally quiet with 17 shooting incidents of which 12 
were directed at Security Forces.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8090')

You already know (I attach a note about this) the gist of what took place this morning.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_153')

There was an increase in shooting incidents: out of a total of 27 the SF were involved in 11. There were 3 large explosions in the area of the City Centre.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7535')

There no casualties at all.	('PREM_15_1002', 'IMG_6837')

The Prime Minister said that the British Government 
had changed the basis on which people were detained in Northern Ireland.	('PREM_15_1691', 'IMG_8880')

In Northern Ireland the ban on parades has been extended for a year, but defiance is planned by ’Loyalist’ as well as civil rights organisations.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6691')

The idea that has been in their minds, though it has not been made public, is that the Regulations under the Acts should be put into suspense unless called into operation by an emergency proclamation by the Governor; and that permanent legislation should be enacted creating certain permanent new offences against the State.	('PREM_15_101', 'IMG_4742')

The proposed terms of reference are:"To investigate the evidence relevant to the allegations 
made by, or on behalf of, those arrested under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 on 9 August about their treatment while in the custody of the Security Forces prior to either their subsequent release, the serving of a detention order or the preferring of a criminal charge."

THIS, IN ADDITION TO THEIR RESPONSIBLE REACTION GENERALLY TO YOUR PROPOSALS, IS A HAPPY AUGURY.	('PREM_15_1006', 'IMG_7297')

The specific decisions to be announced as a result

Under an impartial administration, for example, and with reform of local government which he intended to pursue, the coming local elections in October would provide an opportunity for political activity quite different from the past.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7408')

Collins, a senior figure in the Provisional IRA - who was arrested in Newry on the night of 13 January - is being charged with 
a wounding offence committed in 1969. A check is being made of whether the fact of being charged necessarily prevents him from undergoing ordinary Special Branch interrogation, as the RUC have suggested it does.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6699')

It also seems to me indisputable that, at this point in time, a majority wish to retain the constitutional link with Great Britain, and this being so I do not believe that active discussion of imminent change is realistic or profitable.	('PREM_15_483', 'IMG_5959')

INTERROGATION The Object of Interrogation 
10. The object of interrogation is to obtain reliable information, not to obtain evidence.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5177')

A 301b bomb exploded in a wineshop in Tennent St causing extensive damage but no casualties.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8090')

Two caches of arms were found in Belfast on Friday, totalling four firearms and 2300 rounds of ammunitions and some explosives material was found in Ballymurphy on Sunday.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_6899')

There was some discussion on whether the Board of Visitors could consider complaints by detainees as well as internees.	('PREM_15_484', 'IMG_6261')

There may be a few people wanted for possible detention; but this merely stores up difficulties for ourselves in the future.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1914')

The Four Square Laundry Service, as it was called, has now been withdrawn.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9660')

If the concession were granted in advance of the meeting with the Provisionals they might make further demands.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7655')

Of the 102 legally registered clubs only about 90 actually exist, because club secretaries automatically renew annual applications but the club may be dormant. The actual distribution of clubs throughout the province by Police Divisions is:	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2185')

7. Other points upon which Ministers may wish to be satisfied before 
making a decision are:(a) The risk of heavy "civilian" casualties, which we were formerly advised would be inseparable from an operation to reoccupy the Bogside and Creggan.	('PREM_15_1011', 'IMG_7796')

Moreover, it would be pointless to try to maintain a ban which might well prove to be unenforceable in the light of extreme Republican manifestations; and it would be quite impracticable to ban the march on 12th July.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_212')

The extent to which interrogation teams exploit this advantage must vary with the circumstances, the principal factor being the judgement as to whether the subject has information of great value to give. For example, it would be permissible to carry out sustained interrogation of a high level suspect until all useful information has been extracted from his provided his treatment is	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_1977')

FURTHER CONSULTATION 13.

He repeats the point in a different form in his letter of 1 March.	('PREM_15_1004', 'IMG_7056')

3. As you know, NICRA sent a telegram to SSNI on Tuesday 
apparently alleging that one of the eight; who had since been released, had been "tortured" by the Army - and that another had been ill-treated by the RUC under questioning.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1909')

PRIME MINISTER Well, they did raise a lot of points which we are discussing - our people are discussing with your people.	('PREM_15_479', 'IMG_5829')

WHEN YOU SAW THE SDLP LAST WEEK YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD 
TRY TO GIVE THEM A WRITTEN REPLY THIS WEEK TO THEIR MAIN POINT THAT INTERNMENT SHOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8060')

It was quiet except in Belfast whore SF The 
incidents started after interfactional bombings: initially SF were not involved but later shooting was directed at SF.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8254')

The Party said that although they welcomed the ending of the no-go areas, they were concerned that this had not been followed up by adequate searches for, or capture of, IRA leaders and their weapons of destruction.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7895')

Any discussions would therefore have to be conducted under their "banner"; the position of the SDLP would otherwise be undermined. There should be no difficulty in reaching agreement about "harassment". It would not be possible to give prisoners "political" status, but they could be accommodated in a separate compound and they could probably be allowed to wear their own clothes and perhaps to receive additional letters and	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7658')

of those interrogated would be interned, the process of interrogation would be unlikely to succeed.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_32')

He has said thateven though he would intensely dislike direct rule and could not guarantee how he would react to it, he would regard it as less unacceptable than the transfer of law and order.	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7244')

Furthermore, he had never equated the UDA with the IRA in the level of viciousness of their activities.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_177')

He hoped it would be possible to make early arrangements to accommodate the "political" prisoners separately and to allow them to wear their own clothes.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7655')

The Secretary of State said that,	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7898')

An (I suppose one could Direct rule would I told him that the Irish Government No huffing or puffing 
by Irish public opinion would lead to the result that many people in Dublin now appeared to regard as possible or available - that the British would not merely withdraw the troops from Northern Ireland but would disarm every single Protestant before doing so.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6566')

The adoption of this operational approach has a bearing 
on the Apprentice Boys March.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_256')

These extra forces will be at the tactical disposal of the GOC to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other things to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of information which is coming into the Army’s hands.

I agree that Mr Bradford’s speech was unfortunate and have taken action which will, I hope, keep matters right for the future; over the last few days speeches by some of my colleagues and statements made by back-benchers in yesterday’s Censure debate have, I think, paid tribute to the work of the security forces and have shown a ready appreciation of the difficulties facing them.

ARREST AND INTERROGATION POLICIES 2. 
The meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against 
the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given rise to press enquiries.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9853')

Parts of the route are sensitive and trouble could be caused.	('PREM_15_100', 'IMG_4449')

PUBLIC RELATIONS 3. 
Press reports have already attempted to show that members of the security 
forces are depressed about the truce and what is portrayed as their inability to retaliate against violence.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7621')

(Mr Craig has occasionally spoken of ’lightning’ strikes by Vanguard members.)	('PREM_15_1006', 'IMG_7264')

This was done, and a revised paragraph 9 was telexed to Northern Ireland.)	('CJ_4_251', 'IMG_1788')

We also recognise that to bring violence quickly to an end and to 
resume economic, social and cultural progress means must be found to establish harmony and co-operation between the two communities in Northern Ireland.	('PREM_15_481', 'IMG_5696')

MEANWHILE PLEASE ENSURE THAT SUGGESTION IN POINT 2 OF MY TEL NO 298 IS MODEFIED TO DELETE ALL REFERENCE TO PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM PRIME MINISTER.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_171')

There were 19 shooting incidents and 2 explosions all of which took place in Belfast.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7511')

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 290700 TO 300700 HRS MAY 1973 GENERAL 1. 
There were 13 shooting incidents of which 9 involved SF (Belfast 12/8 
Londonderry -/- Border -/- Rural 1/1) one of these incidents occurred at a polling station in East Belfast.	('PREM_15_1693', 'IMG_9184')

4. 
Contingency study on internment accommodation The results of the contingency study have been given to Northern Ireland.	('PREM_15_477', 'IMG_5562')

As I explained to you on 4 October, and as the draft Report will show you, the allegations which the Home Secretary asked us to investigate have produced specific detailed accounts of the physical experiences of these 2 men under interrogation.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2359')

There were no SF casualties blast bombs were thrown.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8033')

2. 
Two Customs Officers were kidnapped on Thursday morning.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9711')

A number of complaints were made that those arrested were 
Suffering from minor injuries such as cuts and bruises when they arrived at the Holding Centres.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5141')

for the security of detainees themselves.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4983')

Two Protestant youths wore arrested while attempting an armed robbery on a fish and chip shop.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7669')

But the tone of his most recent letter, particularly its conclusion, is not encouraging; "Peterborough" in today’s Daily Telegraph reports that he is launching a world-wide publicity campaign "to put the record straight"; and there has been an oblique hint from Sir Harold Black that, if a solution is "imposed" on Stormont, he and his colleagues may rally behind Mr. Faulkner rather than behind Westminster.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_6893')

This covers his removal 
to the place of interrogation and is in effect a political endorsement of a need for interrogation (no special legal authority is required for the deep interrogation of a person already detained under the Special Powers Acts). 
4. 
Mr. Woodfield’s recommendation has been agreed by the Home Secretary and cleared with the Prime Minister’s office.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2393')

Twenty-eight arrests were made during the evening and 20 baton rounds fired.	('PREM_15_474', 'IMG_5255')

In Armagh there was a gunbattle in Drumarg Estate Between gunmen who fired about 40 rounds and 3 patrols of 1 STAFFORDS, who returned 40 rounds.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9567')

14 DECEMBER 1972 Mr. Whitelaw has announced that the Border Poll in Northern Ireland will take place on 8 March 1973.

He was shot by the Army after he had evaded arrest and taken no heed of warnings.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7469')

Under this heading the meeting should deal with, inter alia:- 
(a) The current level of violence.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7389')

that anger among Northern Catholics in general has been growing because of the political sterility of a purely terrorist policy;	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9819')

If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged, then irrespective of whether he is a member of the Provisional IRA, consideration will be given to a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1802')

There were three explosive attacks, only one of which went off.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9862')

that such camps ought not be located in remote, inaccessible places, but reasonably near the centres of population, so that relatives could visit internees.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6710')

He 
proposed operations to disturb IRA activity which would have many of the advantages of internrment without the same disadvantages.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2221')

One could argue that it would be right for the authorities not to put themselves out to catch and deal with Provisionals wanted by us for offences before the cease fire, on the ground that if the Republic makes the going too hot for them they may go North, where we do not particularly want them.

There were no casualties to SF but one hit was claimed.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9577')

Would it be useful to initiate contacts at official level, in particular on economic problems?	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7407')

As to the second point, the Prime Minister probably has in mind the McGilligan camp on the extreme North West point of Northern Ireland which was temporarily used to house internees when Long Kesh could hold no more.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7501')

C.W. Roberts, Esq.,	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2095')

In pursuit of those objectives, 
since 30 March 1972, 724 persons have been released from internment or detention: 171 persons are still interned and 70 persons are held in detention.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8056')

15. It would appear therefore that we are faced with a revival of the 
traditional type of attack on members of the Security Forces and prominent Northern Ireland personalities and sabotage of Government buildings and public utilities planned and carried out by groups or individuals acting independently.	('PREM_15_101', 'IMG_4627')

Incidents in the last 24 hours Events in Northern Ireland itself were of course largely 
overshadowed by the explosion at Aldershot, details of which have already been reported

prisoners in Irish and British Jails, for all internees and detainees and for all persons on the wanted list.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_149')

In my view they’re the bravest police force in the world and in fact, judging by their activities especially ever the last few months, perhaps one of the most effective and efficient.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5239')

At that moment, the professions of Loyalist leaders that they would seek the downfall of the Executive and Assembly by legitimate democratic processes would be open to IP attack; by the same token, SF operations Would be justifiable as impartial and designed to preserve law and order.

The Northern Ireland Parliament continues with its present range of functions and responsibilities; Westminster assumes no new role in the Province and responsibility for law and order stays as it is; representatives of the minority community are not to be brought into Government except on invitation of the Prime Minister; any change in internment policy is stoutly resisted; there are proposals for closer association with the Republic but they have no real chance of acceptance in the South.

Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase of staff sufficient to provide for the separate custody of each individual while in transit between his own room and the interrogation room, there would be increased risks of physical violence or of a need for physical contact between detainees and guards.

15. The pressure being exorted by Right-wing Protestant organisations on the Government to cancel the new ban on traditional marches is likely to increase and there will be a danger of sectarinn clashes in Armagh on 22 January 1972 if the local UPV call for ’resistance’ to the civil rights march planned for that day receivos any volume of support.

But they also seem to have been taken by surprise by a well-concealed change of plan on the part of the marchers; and, although all ended peacefully, a repetition of this tactic on another occasion might not have an equally peaceful outcome.	('PREM_15_1002', 'IMG_6850')

Moreover, even if the mental effect did not disappear at 
once, it was impossible to say how far that was due to the techniques employed as opposed to the anxiety state which would be induced by reason of the detainee’s continued detention, and, if he gave information, the guilty knowledge which he had of letting down his fellows coupled with the fear of reprisals.

intent on defying the ban, led the marchers into direct confrontation with the Security Forces and lost control of the hooligan element.	('PREM_15_1002', 'IMG_6852')

ANNEX A TO DOIC/200/INT DATED 7 JUL 70 
General and Political 1. 
The sombre events of the past fortnight have demonstrated anew the intractable nature o the problem in Northern Ireland - the suspicion, fear and hate 
which divide the communities and lead their more militant members into orgies of blind, destructive rioting.	('PREM_15_100', 'IMG_4508')

There was a reason for our insistence.	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7141')

There was no possibility of sitting down for talks with the Unionist Party while that Party was responsible for the continued internment of their constituents.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7949')

This assessment is concerned mainly with the background information on each person, his personality type and his physical and mental state at the time.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_1977')

There were no other Security Force casualties and nine hits were claimed.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_110')

In response to our requests for evidence to substantiate 
their claim that a British Army patrol crossed into the Republic on 19 October the Irish Government are sending a map in support of their version of the incident.	('PREM_15_483', 'IMG_6049')

Three soldiers were wounded by shooting, one is VSI.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7468')

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE DISCUSSIONS WITH MR FAULKNER ON 1ST APRIL 
1. 
Improved surveillance of the Border Terms of reference for a study by the GOC Northern Ireland of questions 
relating to the security of the land border were sent to him on 8th April, after interdepartmental discussion.	('PREM_15_477', 'IMG_5562')

This lasted five The two beaters left 
questioned 
th ng over They then before we 
stomach with his fist while the other stood by to watch me.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5242')

60 Protestant youths held 
1 cwt of ammonium nitrate was found in Brassle Way.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7556')

EVEN SINCE WE SPOKE TOGETHER MR FAULKNER HAS REPEATED MORE THAN 
ONCE THAT THE ONLY KIND OF GOVERNMENT HE CAN ENVISAGE IN THE NORTH IS ONE In WHICH PARTICIPATION WILL NEVER BE GRANTED EXCEPT TO UNIONISTS.	('PREM_15_482', 'IMG_6153')

Mr Taylor the Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs reacting to the Crossmaglen border incident said in an interview that border roads might now have to be blown up to prevent illegal crossings from the Irish Republic.	('PREM_15_480', 'IMG_5630')

Hillery said that for two years Mr. Lynch"had been seen to drift along on a half hope all of his own creation". The Home Secretary said that he had been told by many eminent Catholics 
that the reform programme now being carried out removed genuine grievances.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_145')

On 27 September a 100 lb bomb destroyed Armagh City Hall and others damaged premises in Armagh, Newry, Dungiven and Portadown.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9660')

His problem was primarily one of tiing.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7948')

But I would be grateful for confirmation that this is acceptable.	('PREM_15_479', 'IMG_5843')

It is believed that the Irish Department of External Affairs has taken a decision in principle in favour of doing so.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_6998')

The same evidence had 
been given by army witnesses both to the Compton Committee and to the court in the Moore case; on the former occasion 
they had been believed but on the latter occasion they had not been believed.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_6983')

2. WITHIN THESE LIMITS, I SEE NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCUSSING THIS WITH MR LYNCH.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2206')

But whenever investigations come to an end the results and the reasons for them (including any refusals to co-operate) should be publicised.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7352')

The proper response to picketing is firstly a matter for the RUC 
who should try to dissuade the pickets, move them on or, if necessary, arrest them.	('DEFE_24_877', 'IMG_1724')

THIS DECISION IS ALREADY SEEN TO HAVE BEEN FUTILE AND, EVEN WORSE, IT HAS BEEN A TRAGIC MISTAKE.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_162')

Security Forces traffic was not impeded.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7511')

was particularly asked by the Official Committee to consider this; and he should be invited to express a view.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_237')

13. In a statement on 22 January about the previous week’s disturbances in the Roman Catholic area of Ballymurphy, Mr. G. Fitt’s SDLP spoke of "certain elements who had been taking advantage of the troubled situation by engaging in crime and criminal activities", and expressed its support for an unarmed RUC.

The essentials of such an initiative would be that there should be no change in the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, but that changes should be made in the form of Government of Northern Ireland which would give the minority parties the assurance of an active and permanent share in the decisions which shape the Government and the future of the Province.

The Secretary of State said thathe intended to announce the lifting of the ban on marches later in the day together with an amnesty which would cover, amongst others, Miss Devlin and Mr McManus.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7407')

Street disturbances, involving stoning of troops, occurred in Londonderry on 3 and 4 January.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6472')

There wore no military casualties or hits claimed.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9862')

THE ESSENTIAL MEASURES ON WHICH WE HAVE DECIDED INCLUDE THE TRANSFER OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER FROM STORMONT TO WEST MINISTER: A REVIEW OF EXISTING INTERNMENT ORDERS SO THAT THE LESS IMPORTANT OF THE INTERNEES ARE PROGRESSIVELY RELEASED: THE APPOINTMENT OF A SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AS A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT;	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7207')

The Committee accepted that this was reasonable, and I do not think that we can press the point any further for the time being.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1911')

MR. FAULKNER Right I will do that.	('PREM_15_479', 'IMG_5829')

The Committee’s Findings 12. I asked the Committee to adopt procedures which were designed to protect the lives of those who had conducted the arrests and interrogations against the risk of retaliation.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5168')

The Home Office expert was most unhappy at the idea of using the camp, two huts of which have been blown up in recent months.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2290')

5. There has been full Press coverage for the discovery that a 
boy of 14 from the Ardoyne whose body was found in a hearse travelling from the Republic towards Belfast 
- with a death certificate signed by 
a doctor at the Louth County Infirmary in Dundalk saying that death was due to a non-infectious disease - 
had in fact been shot in the 
stomach.	('PREM_15_1002', 'IMG_6741')

2. AT THE LONDUNDERRY TALKS WITH ME ON 3 AUGUST (MY 
TEL 025 TO NIO), A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED, BUT THE MAIN TOPIC WAS TALKS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7885')

13 bomb attacks were spread throughout the Province but shootings mainly confined to city areas, though there were a couple of cross border shooting incidents.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9650')

At some unspecified time thereafter, he disappeared over the Border into the Republic whence he has not officially returned.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2101')

Militant Loyalist activity has reduced, though the UDA have been in evidence in Larne, Carrickfergus, Greenisland and Lisburn. Portadown has not featured so	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9692')

Interrogation was authorised by the Northern 
Ireland Government with the knowledge and acquiescence of Her Majesty’s Government.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5166')

No damage was done and there were no casualties.	('PREM_15_1693', 'IMG_9147')

In doing this, they were running the risk that the Supreme Court would rule the legislation unconstitutional.	('PREM_15_1015', 'IMG_8286')

Her Majesty’s Government accordingly undertook to assist the Government of Northern Ireland in arranging for the RUC to set up an interrogation centre.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5131')

The Northern Ireland Government 
would need to be consulted because they would provide prison officers to guard the internees.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4855')

It 
might be convenient to deal with these subjects at this point in the agenda.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7595')

I am sure your Lordships will join me in strongly welcoming this decision.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6613')

It was agreed that short statements should be issued to the effect that there had been full and frank discussions between the two sides and that a further meeting would be held early next week.

MEMORANDUM BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS ON INTERNMENT 1. 
There has been considerable speculation in the press about the possibility 
of ending internment, and when I met Mr Heath on 4 February 1972 I has asked whether I saw any early prospects of its being phased out.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_6957')

Their bombing campaign was largely discredited and only the existence of the Londonderry ’No-Go’ areas kept alive their dream of a "final take-over of the North".

3. 
As regards the interim period of commission government itself, the 
following points need to be noted and/or decided:(i) 
There is to be a separate Minister for Northern Ireland.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_7012')

These two incidents resulted in a declaration by the UDA that they would mobilise 3,000 men to assist the Security Forces in the prevention of bombings and assassinations.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9885')

It would be helpful if the Army could undertake the building work on the same basis as in the original construction, and he would discuss with the Home Secretary the possibility of securing volunteers for the prison service from England.	('PREM_15_482', 'IMG_6175')

IN DOING SO, THEY HAVE INEVITABLY PROVOKED EXTREMISTS AMONG THE PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO THE IRA CHALLENGE BY A MEASURE OF VIOLENCE AND BY SETTING UP THEIR OWN BARRICADES.	('PREM_15_1011', 'IMG_7756')

Many of them developed marked aptitude for intelligence duties and proved themselves to be possessed of tact, patience and intuition.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2146')

2. 
The Director of Intelligence-reports that both factions of the IRA have now 
succeeded in giving the impression that they wish the campaign of violence to go on.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7469')

Rather more extreme measures were conjured up by a report that a register of people willing to form a reconstructed Ulster Special Constabulary (B Specials) was to be drawn up.	('PREM_15_480', 'IMG_5630')

3. Preventive Detention.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2031')

(b) Or do the risks involved - the likelihood of attitudes 
hardening further by October, the strain of the bilateral agreement with the Westminster Opposition, the timing of the Lynch visit, and the probability of increasing restiveness in public opinion here and abroad - rule out this course and make it imperative to take some action in the near future?	('PREM_15_479', 'IMG_5892')

informing the Home Secretary of a resolution of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party passed on 22 December to the effect that the NEC condemned the policy of internment and the methods of interrogation revealed by the Compton Report;	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6476')

Regulation 10 Regulation 11 
6. - - 
for interrogation on suspicion 
Regulation 10. For the time being this Regulation is NOT to be used.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1807')

Among these factors I. would particularly mention the following.	('PREM_15_474', 'IMG_5326')

17. The Official IRA have said that the Government’s proposals are a change for the worse in that they constitute a reduction in democracy in Northern Ireland.	('PREM_15_1006', 'IMG_7346')

There was with 
patrol were fired on from across the border near Crossmaglen.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9579')

This disagreeable ending note did nothing to dispel 
my overriding impression that moderate opinion is firmly behind the Administration, that there is a real and well-founded feeling of optimism abroad and that security is immeasurably improved.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_87')

nevertheless casualties were 
heavy and included five soldiers (making 13 in all in the 7 days since the ceasefire ended, the worst week yet), one RUC and one civilian killed.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_110')

As far as the Rolls Royce attack was concerned, it should be realised that whereas the Communist cell in West Belfast was pro-Republican, the Communist cell in East Belfast was pro-Protestant.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_177')

Mr. MacStiofain was very much in charge.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_159')

Hooliganism in the form of stoning and bottling of patrols was considerably reduced compared to the previous week and at a ’Prayer for Peace’ meeting 1500 people were exhorted to keep the children off the streets.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9660')

2. In a nutshell, what is being suggested is as follows: a. 
- normally, of course, its CID - 
Where a suspect is being questioned in respect of some specific crime, the questioning by the RUC 
be strictly within the terms of the Judges Rules.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2059')

Where arrests are made under Regulation 10 in the first instance the total period should still not exceed 72 hours.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1864')

Moreover a further meeting would have to be held under the aegis of the SDLP whose position would otherwise be undermined.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7656')

17. NRM Rally at LONG KESH attracted only 120 supporters but also 30 rival Protestants.	('PREM_15_1007', 'IMG_7458')

l7 August 1400 hours Departure from the centre to be lodged (in detention in Belfast Prison.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2367')

Acting on information from the Gardai 2 cars were stopped at the border at Aughnacloy and 2 mon were arrested; they were wanted for theft.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_72')

In the mountains east of Strabane, over 1,500 rounds of ammunition were found in an Army search on 15 January.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6692')

16. We then said that a number of members of their organisation were well known not only by name but by sight and that the prospects of the cease fire leading to permanent peace depended very largely on these people lying low; we gave one or two examples and they replied that if people of this kind were to strut about in Protestant areas this would be an act of provocation.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7680')

on no occasion,	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5127')

Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase separate custody 
of staff sufficient to provide for the of each individual while in transit between his own 
room and the interrogation room, there would be increased risks of physical contact between detainees and guards.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5192')

Increase public confidence in the Border areas, 
particularly Police Division L, by frequent patrolling by helicopter, in vehicles and on foot including visits to isolated homes.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1821')

The Attorney General might also be asked whether there is any change in the position as regards the civil claims for wrongful arrest or ill-treatment, particularly in the light of the potentially damaging effect on the morale of the RUC of a continuing failure to obtain convictions.

A ban would therefore imply capitulation to Republican views; and the Committee must consider how far this might be mitigated by the new measures of harassment of the IRA recently undertaken by the Army.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_237')

An Act which went no 
further than to bar private prosecutions and transfer existing compensation jurisdiction from the courts to adinistrative tribunals for security reasons would probably not raise the sae problems, either in Parliament or at Strasbourg, that would be raised by abridging the existing remedies in the way proposed in the draft N I Bill which confined compensation to cases involving bodily injury.

5. 
The aims of the IRA are to intimidate the population by brutal 
terrorism and so to prevent any co-operation with the Government, the police and the courts of law; to inhibit normal political activity and constitutional progress; and to cause the public in Great Britain to become so sickened by the ceaseless bloodshed and destruction that the Army’s withdrawal will come to be seen as the lesser of two evils.

This is then publicised, rather than being sent as a serious complaint to the RUC or other authority.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1924')

Internment

Mr. Faulkner said that he was disinclined to go into such detail.	('PREM_15_484', 'IMG_6262')

Other factors were the decision of the Prime Minister of This last consideration might argue in favour of a

It has been submitted to us that because these things are so - and in my opinion 
they are so - the procedures were necessary to obtain, for the purpose of saving lives, information which could not otherwise have been obtained or alternatively not obtained so quickly, that they are therefore morally justifiable, that the same may well be so in future conditions of emergency elsewhere and that the procedures with such amendments as may be thought desirable, should remain available.

The Government therefore propose to set up at an early date a commission of experienced lawyers and laymen to advise them on the measures required to deal with terrorist organisations and to bring to book individuals involved in terrorist activities without the necessity to resort to powers of internment; and, in the light of the commission’s report, to prepare substantive legislation to that end.

Moreover, it is in the Army’s interest that suspected terrorists should 
not only reveal 
information but should also, as far as possible, be kept out of circulation; if internment is in future to be available only exceptionally - if at all - for this purpose, then it becomes important for us as well as for the civil authorities that as few prosecutions as possible founder because the accused’s confession has been obtained by means which totally rule out its admissability.

AN ASSESSMENT OF THESE VARIVUS .	('PREM_15_1016', 'IMG_8672')

24th November, 1971 
series but before taking up my present duties, I sent you some thoughts on Ireland in contemplation of the impending escalation.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6565')

A Vanguard Rally, attended by about 600 people passed off peacefully, in the Waterside.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9862')

At 1100 hrs the Governor heard 
that certain prisoners due to appear in Court were refusing to go.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8091')

They need relatively small quantities of arms and men to maintain an embarrassing level of violence; and, although internment on a large scale could be expected to have a significant long term effect, they would be capable of provoking serious incidents in the short term even if we managed to find most of the weapons they now have available in the North.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_19')

THE ONLY WHITE PAPER WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A PERMANENT PEACE IS ONE IN WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT RELINQUISHES ITS INTEREST IN EXERCISING SOVEREIGNTY OVER ANY PART OF IRELAND: DECLARES ITS RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE ISLAND OF IRELAND TO CONTROL THEIR OWN AFFAIRS SEMICOLON AND ANNOUNCE A DATE FOR DISENGAGEMENT AND WITHDRAWAL.	('PREM_15_1691', 'IMG_8829')

300 people attended and they were dispersed by RUC and 2 platoons of 1 GREEN HOWARDS.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_126')

were driving openly around and performing foot patrols.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9746')

A widely publicised PD march to Long Kesh was attended by not more than 100 people and was halted and dispersed without incident by RUC.	('PREM_15_1016', 'IMG_8483')

We understand that the present view at Stormont is that the march should be allowed to take 
place, but that the traditional route must certainly be altered so as to avoid the city walls where they look down on the Bogside (which has proved a flash-point in the past, not least in 1969). It is thought that the march organisers are much more likely to be prepared to cooperate in such re-routing if, in the meantime, some positive action is seen to be taken against IRA leaders.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_256')

Indeed, it cannot be assumed that any UK 
Minister has ever had the full nature of these particular techniques brought to his attention, and, consequently, that he has ever specifically authorised their use.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4999')

It is a little doubtful whether this item 
ought to be discussed in full Cabinet but, if you are not keen on a separate meeting, there is probably no real objection to raising it in Cabinet.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2394')

8. The deputation reiterated the Party’s wish for early talks between the British Government and elected representatives on the restoration of parliamentary democracy but said that there must first be effective action in dealing with the IRA.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7895')

The possibility of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issuing a broad directive for release to the press on Her Majesty’s Government’s security objectives in Northern Ireland was discussed, but the disadvantage of this was that it might be construed as a corrective in the light of recent allegations against the Army by Catholic priests.

NOTE FOR THE RECORD Northern Ireland The Leader of the Opposition and Mr. Callaghan came to 
see the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday 15 December at 4.45 p.m. The Leader of the Opposition said that the 
Cabinet had taken up a rather different position from the one which he had suggested in his speech on the arrangements for the proposed inter-party talks.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6542')

Experience shows, however, that an indiscriminate

In addition about one third of our forces are available, as opportunities arise, for offensive operations such as hot pursuit of terrorists, arms searches, border patrols, and road-blocks; but this proportion will inevitably be reduced if basic security deteriorates and we have, for example, to deploy substantial forces to deal with intersectarian disturbances.

Once internment had been introduced and the need for secrecy no longer existed, it would be possible to bring workmen in, to protect vulnerable services in the forward part of the ship so that within about two weeks, nor it would be possible to move the internees to a more secure area and increase their numbers to about 300. Other facilities could be arranged ad hoc.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2273')

As regards the rifle clubs, most of their members 
- as the RUC

HILLERY SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT BY HIS GOVERNMENT 
TO EXPLAIN THEIR VIEWS.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_149')

FOR OUR PART, WE ARE OF COURSE VERY ONCERNED ABOUT 
THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FORCES ARE COMMITED IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THE IMPLICATION OF THAT FOR OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY 
ELSEWHERE.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_196')

More conciliation is the only solution.	('PREM_15_1010', 'IMG_136')

There would be great dangers, however, in trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced to reduce their campaign against civilians.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7842')

5. The increased burden which this transfer of responsibilities will 
entail means that it will no longer be possible for my right honourable Friend, the Home Secretary, to discharge these duties in addition to his many other responsibilities.	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7214')

Dr. Fitzgerald said that he and his colleagues hoped that the 
British Government would be able to let them have a copy of the White Paper somewhat in advance of publication, so that they could have time to prepare their comment and make it as helpful as possible.	('PREM_15_1691', 'IMG_8880')

DESPITE THE BRIEF CEASEFIRE, THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, THAT THEY HAVE THE DELIBERATE AIM OF PREVETING RECONCiLIATION AND THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO USE EVERY METHOD OF INTIMIDATION TO DETER THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY FROM JOINING IN THE SEARCH FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS.	('PREM_15_1011', 'IMG_7756')

Accordingly a second and more difficult question arises as to whether, 
even if the use of these techniques complies with the Directive, their application by a civilised and humane society can be morally justified.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4997')

What is certain is that legislation will be required; that, if there is local opposition, a short period of "Governor’s Rule" (based on the Governor’s powers under the 1920 Act), may be inevitable; and that in certain circumstances even this might need separate legislation of its own, of the one -clause-in-one -day variety.

Special Questioning 40. A limited number of persons whom it had been decided to detain, were 
selected for interrogation in depth and on 11 August were moved for that purpose from their Holding Centres to a place other than the place specified in the detention order before being lodged in detention in Crumlin Jail on 16 and 17 August. (This special class of arrested persons is covered in section 6 of our Report).

Home Office doubts on this score have been conveyed privately to the Secretary to the Cabinet and it is known that both the former GOC and the present Chief Constable feel that they are being publicly placed in a somewhat invidious position.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4854')

a single shot was fired at a patrol from Eire and North East of Forkill a single shot was fired at a patrol.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_54')

the threatened march along the Falls Road by members of the Provisional wing of the IRA,	('PREM_15_477', 'IMG_5550')

considerable military effort had been earmarked in anticipation of events which largely failed to materialise.	('PREM_15_1002', 'IMG_6795')

4. The likely chain of events following the decision to intern on the lines proposed might be as follows 
a. The immediate implementation of the IRA contingency counter plan We have four days in which to expose it - a good challenge to Int.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2188')

As well as the usual hoolitan activity in Andersonstown,there

We were not able at this stage to get them to agree to advance the time before Friday.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7680')

TYPES OF ARREST Red Handed Arrests 3. 
These are normally made under the general "citizen" powers where a 
soldier sees a person commit, or suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has just committed a breach of the peace or serious offence, e.g.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1807')

The advice of the security forces is that the numbers involved would be something between 350 and 450. 
There is no suitable prison building which could be 
used.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_4854')

REFORM.	('PREM_15_1003', 'IMG_6906')

They 
took place in Armagh (twice) and Portadown (once). There were no casualties and no fire was returned.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8091')

These allegations were under investigation by the Compton Committee, and were in that sense sub judice.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5233')

(b) Weapons are to be available but not "at the ready" when on vehicle patrol.	('CJ_4_251', 'IMG_1793')

I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7704')

The existence of the regular garrison there would be both a deterrent and insurance against any attempted ingress from the area.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2296')

First possibility is 
Faulkner’s counter-proposal, likely to be unacceptable (too little and too late) to British Government.	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7237')

There are no plans for the payment of compensation.	('PREM_15_485', 'IMG_5128')

There have been references to the possibility of this kind of approach in the press; but we are keen not to show our hands publicly before we are ready,both because of the practical difficulties and because of the risk that terrorists would be put on their guard and would lay in a stock of unmarked

to set against the probable criticism that one repressive measure was being substituted for another (criticism which would be unjust, but nonetheless probable).

The paper is based on the assumptions that the report finds 
that physical ill-treatment, though not brutality or cruelty, was used in the interrogation of eleven internees; that the report does not make a judgement as to whether it was right or wrong for physical ill-treatment to be used in the circumstances; and that the Government accepts the findings of the report as regards the treatment of internees under interrogation.

The meeting had before it HQNI Paper 1113G of 12 December, para 7(e) of which would have been modified by the decision taken at the Secretary of State’s meeting of 13 December (SSM (72) 118 Item 2). 
The GOC said that subsequent discussions between his HQ and NIO Belfast had revealed that the proposed modification would have introduced unforeseen difficulties.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1803')

Two hits were claimed.	('PREM_15_1016', 'IMG_8497')

There is no evidence before me as to the character of any witness, nor as to what gives rise to any suspicion under which a person has been arrested, detained, or interned, and no presumption against any person arrested, detained or interned, or their evidence, is implied from such matters.

Well.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6652')

Most of the 
information which is given to the Committee on this point will be derived from our experience in Northern Ireland not,only because it 
is most recent and of most immediate concern to the Committee but also because it is the best documented interrogation operation.	('PREM_15_475', 'IMG_5073')

With regard to the notes on the supplementary dealing with 
the legal protection of servicemen I should add that this subject has been discussed between the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office, and it has been agreed that: 
a. We should not rule out civil actions against the Crown on account of deep interrogation (or other matters). Some 25 actions are pending, including 3 arising out of deep interrogation.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2095')

and a step towards civil war.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6566')

THEIR BASIC THEME WAS AGAIN THAT SO FAR AS THE SDLP WERE CONCERNED, 
THEY WOULD NOT ATTEND THE ALL PARTY CONFERENCE UNTIL INTERNMENT ENDED ( ONE REASON WAS THATWERE THEY TO DO SO, THEY WOULD LOSE ALL THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE CATHOLICS). 
9. THE SDLP SAID THEY WERE NOW FACED WITH A DECISION: EITHER THEY COULD ATTACK MR WHITELAW, HMG AND THE SECURITY FORCES OR SOME MEANS MUST BE FOUND TO SUSTAIN THE FEELING OF HOPE ENGENDERED AMONGST CATHOLICS BY THEIR TALKS WITH MR WHITELAW.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7887')

RUC RESERVE 5. 
It was announced on 11 January that, on the recommendation of the Police 
Authority, it had now been agreed that the authorised establishment of the Reserve should be increased from 1,500 to 2,500, and that provision should be made for full-time service by members of the Reserve in support of the regular force, on a short-term basis, to relieve the heavy burden placed on the regular force by station-protection duties.

We were not allowed up 318. After our business 
had been stated over the telephone from the e’trance hall, the spokesman for Home Affairs said

which came from "unofficial channels,

With regard to the provision of custodial staff, I am afraid that I 
can say no more than that the Northern Ireland Government have accepted the need to provide internal custodians and are considering ways in which they can provide the staff when the need arises.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2248')

You told me that the Prime Minister might like to say something We suggest that this might be along the lines that the 
Northern Ireland Government have said that they would welcome a visit to places of internment by the International Red Cross; that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has conveyed this invitation to Geneva; and that a team from the International Red Cross is expected to visit Northern Ireland in the near future.	('PREM_15_481', 'IMG_5717')

They saw the validity of this and it was eventually proposed that Mr McGrory who had been present when we first met should be invited to call at a convenient place and see a written statement signed by the Secretary of State covering the three points.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7680')

PROTESTANTS 
9. There is intelligence that, at the meeting of Protestant militant leaders on 6 February, chaired by 
, to discuss 
their response to the signing of Interim Custody Orders on two UDA/UVF men, it was agreed that serious confrontation between the Protestant para-military groups and the security forces should be avoided.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_31')

19. I next consider the possibility of a ’federal’ solution.	('PREM_15_474', 'IMG_5321')

14. We on our side raised a number of points designed to ensure that if a cease fire was declared it should be effective.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7679')

For this we have to call in 
question each of the seven points (in paragraph 1 above) on which our policy is based; and since we are getting virtually nowhere with points (iv) to (vii) it is (i), (ii) and (iii) that need to be examined critically.	('PREM_15_483', 'IMG_6071')

The SDLP had made such political sacrifices so far that if the Secretary of State was unable to respond to their approach by ending internment immediately they would be completely discredited in the eyes of the Roman Catholic community.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7948')

Before Ministers finally disperse we ought to be clear where we stand, 
particularly if the Home Secretary is to meet Mr. Faulkner later in the week.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_222')

50 RMP with an equal number of RUC have been specially charged with investigating these murders and with preventing further cases.	('PREM_15_1689', 'IMG_160')

There can certainly be no direct dealing with the provisional IRA while violence continues, but history suggests that the United Kingdom Government has, in the context of other political settlements, had some contact with those who have participated in extremist activities.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7671')

I DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT THAT, WHEN A MEETING HAS ALREADY BEEN ARRANGED BETWEEN US TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE RANGE OF MATTERS OF COM INTEREST TO OUR TWO COUNTRIES YOU SHOULD HAVE PUBLICLY TAKEN UP A POSITION SO CALCULATED NOT, ONLY TO INCREASE TENSION IN NORTHERN IRELAND BUT ALSO TO IMPAIR OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE IRISH REPUBLIC.

WE CALL ON ALL IRISH PEOPLE, NORTH AND SOUTH, WHO ARE OPPOSED BOTH TO REPRESSION AND VIOLENCE TO JOIN TOGETHER IN POLITICAL ACTION AIMED AT THIS OBJECTIVE.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_55')

A statement will be issued as soon as possible about the incident in which a woman was hit in the face by 
a rubber bullet during the search.	('PREM_15_483', 'IMG_5990')

And the Committee will wish to hear from the GOC how far he regards the new measures of harassment as in some sense an alternative to internment; and, if so, how long they are likely to remain effective for this purpose.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_237')

BUT I WOULD JUDGE THAT THEIR OVER WHELMING IMPRESSION WILL BE THAT WHILE CONDITIONS IN CRUMLIN ARE FAIRLY GOOD, IF A LITTLE CROWDED, CONDITIONS AT LONGNKESH ARE MORE OPEN TO CRITICISM

Mr. Smith suggested that if the activity of the army as in proposed swoops could be presented as a major now drive against the IRA it might be possible to call upon the Protesants to give up their march without too drastic a reaction.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2222')

POLITICO/MILITARY SUMMARY OF 1972 1. The only safe assessment of 1972 is to see it as a build-up period to the 
climax expected in 1973. In political terms this is undoubtedly the case; but in military terms it seems at least possible that historians will identify the climax in 1972, and regard subsequent events as part of a period of consolidation.	('PREM_15_1690', 'IMG_8814')

But in any event, to retain under the full control

There was a strong view at Cabinet last week that internment should precede direct rule, particularly since we might well be creating subsequent political embarrassment for ourselves if we needed, under direct rule, to use a weapon which we had earlier denied to the Northern Ireland Government.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_238')

This programme, to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr. Faulkner’s recent initiative, has pointed the way forward.	('PREM_15_479', 'IMG_5894')

Indeed, it cannot be assumed that full nature of these particular techniques , that he has ever specifically

Service personnel are instructed in the art of interrogation in depth, and where members of our Services are also taught to be resistant to such interrogation.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_1940')

ANNEX A TO DOIC/200/INT DATED 17 AUG 70 
Political and General 1. 
The fortnight has been punctuated with violence and tension and there was 
intensification of the political activity, reported in the last assessment, which developed in the Unionist Party following the Northern Ireland Government’s ban on marches and the outbreak of Catholic rioting both in Belfast and, later, in Londonderry.	('PREM_15_101', 'IMG_4623')

I BELIEVED THAT IF HE DID SO THERE WOULD BE NO OBJECTION TO INTERNMENT BEING THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA, OR INDEED THE ONLY ONE, ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT FIND THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PASS ON TO OTHER SUBJECTS AS WELL.	('PREM_15_482', 'IMG_6133')

Nevertheless this is the first new constructive approach that we have been able to put in hand: it is in line with statements by the two governments that subversive elements will be brought under the rule of the law: and to activate the internment powers would immediately bring to an abrupt halt the police enquiries.

The matter is due to be discussed at the next meeting of the Joint Security Committee on 17th February and I will let you know the outcome of that meeting as soon as possible, That said, however, it is difficult to see how any policy less forthcoming than the one I have outlined above could make much of a contribution towards a successful political package.

There have been a number of attempts at escape of which this latest is probably the most serious.	('PREM_15_1012', 'IMG_7858')

DRAFT LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER 
Internment 1. 
When we met at the end of last month to discuss Northern 
Ireland, it was agreed that Reggie Maudling and I should have further discussions with the object of finding funds for the construction of an internment camp at Long Kesh.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2257')

Ministers will clearly wish to endorse the Attorney General’s view that we should take every possible opportunity of delaying the Strasbourg hearings; he might be asked to report on the current position.	('PREM_15_1009', 'IMG_7697')

However, they dispersed peacefully when asked to do so by Security Forces.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8090')

In the view of the Secretary of State and CGS, it is essential that a statement about the rundown of internment should be made as part of the "package" and that it should be a statement which will make a convincing impact: this involves a risk which has to be accepted: anything which does not go as far as the revised statement which we now suggest is unlikely to have an adequate impact on the situation.	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7248')

One final point.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2390')

Its very general conclusion was that, while political progress by the end of the year was not impossible, and an improvement in the security situation could not be ruled out, it was more likely that violence would continue on roughly the present scale, thus hardening the divisions between Catholics and Protestants and further narrowing the basis for any political settlement.	('PREM_15_482', 'IMG_6199')

HILLERY SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT’S POSITION WAS THAT INTERNMENT COULD NOT BE EXCLUDED IN THE FUTURE, BUT THAT IT WAS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTEMPLATE INTRODUCING IT IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS HELPING TO CONSOLIDATE UNIONIST CONTROL IN THE NORTH.

Dublin stores, though so far no serious injury has been caused, although there was some damage to property.	('PREM_15_1008', 'IMG_7553')

5. MR. LYNCH’S VIEW ON THIS WAS THAT POLICE CO-OPERATION WAS FUNCTIONING DISCREETLY: THERE WERE NO MEANS OF ORGANISING ANY PLANNED MILITARY CO-OPERATION, BUT IF AD HOC AND BY CHANCE A PATROL ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER PASSED A FRIENDLY WORD TO ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE, NO HARM WOULD BE DONE.	('PREM_15_478', 'IMG_230')

[If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged, then irrespective of whether he is a member of the Provisional IRA, consideration will be given to a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient.]	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1813')

If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1813')

This is an indication of the slightly reduced tempo of IRA operations brought about by extensive patrolling, made possible by the present force levels, which inhibits the movement of weapons, gunmen and explosives.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9806')

3. ON YOUR PROPOSAL THAT THERE NIGHT BE MATERIAL TO JUSTIFY 
THE FORMULATION OF A CHARGE FOR AN EXTRADITABLE OFFENCE IN THE RECENTLY PUBLICIZED IRA TORTURE CASE, SHILLINGTON SAYS THAT THE ALLEGED TORTURER, CURRAN, HAS NOW BEEN’LIFTED’ HERE AND THE RUC HAVE MADE AN APPLICATION FOR HIS INTERNMENT.	('PREM_15_484', 'IMG_6270')

It also seems to me indisputable that, at this point in time, a majority wish to retain the constitutional link with Great Britain, and this being so I do not believe that active discussion of imminent change is realistic or profitable.	('PREM_15_483', 'IMG_6019')

Since the conference is likely to be unproductive in any event, this price, too, may be thought worth paying.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8109')

The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces.	('DEFE_13_1358', 'IMG_9672')

It was confirmed by the military representatives that a list of between 
325 and 375 names had been drawn up by Special Branch and that 20-40 per cent of these sight be involved in the initial operation.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2210')

with representatives of the Army, the RUC and others proposals which the Army have been putting forward for strengthening certain of their powers under the Special Powers Act and in particular for clarifying their powers of arrest and interrogation.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1861')

reflect prevailing conditions.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2141')

For example, a factory 3 miles east of Antrim was used by a reinforcing unit until October 1970. This factory has now been sold and it is unlikely that it could be requisitioned, but it is just possible that a similar kind of site might be obtained.

Cummings told me that this had been discussed 
in the Joint Security Committee this morning in the context of the Northern Ireland Government’s invitation to the International Red Cross to visit places of internment, and bearing in mind their refusal so far to allow their own Members of Parliament to make a general inspection of places of internment as opposed to visiting individual constituents.	('PREM_15_481', 'IMG_5718')

No prisoner would leave the holding centre until a further medical examina-tion had been made.	('CJ_4_458', 'IMG_1931')

In their statement of 29 May - the burden of which has since been repeated - the Officials said they would continue their political campaign, including civil disobedience, until their demands were met.	('PREM_15_1013', 'IMG_8151')

The intention obviously is for the marchers to form up first within the Bogside and Creggan estates and to march for some distance within those areas, before emerging at a point where it will be feasible for the security forces to prevent them from continuing.	('PREM_15_1001', 'IMG_6678')

Mr O’Malley, the minister for Justice, said on 4 January that he did not think it was necessary to create more severe penalties for illegal possession of firearms.	('PREM_15_1000', 'IMG_6471')

2. I think I can do no better than to give you a copy of the 
most recent paper prepared on this subject which puts the position or Long Kesh and the requirements for it in reasonable perspective.	('DEFE_24_1214', 'IMG_2258')

The Army always co-operates to the full in such enquiries where this is necessary.	('DEFE_13_919', 'IMG_2098')

The 
latter would not be sufficiently responsive to a fast moving situation.	('PREM_15_1005', 'IMG_7249')

I feel though that I should let you know that I am not completely satisfied with certain aspects of these arrangements.	('DEFE_13_917', 'IMG_2392')

However, the visit which our experts have paid indicates that the MAIDSTONE could, if necessary, be used at short notice as an interim internment vessel and it is assumed that you will have no objection to the Army Department taking account of her availability in their contingency planning.

There is

TO TRY TO DO THINGS IN THIS WAY, WHILE DISCUSSION WITH THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NON-UNIONIST COMMUNITY IS BARRED BY THE EXISTENCE OF SELECTIVE AND POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INTERNMENT, IS, AS I HAVE SAID TO YOU, A FUTILE EXERCISE AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO THINK OTHERWISE.
