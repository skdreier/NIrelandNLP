We conclude that an operation on the lines discussed is militarily feasible provided that Ministers accept the implications described below; and that it could be mounted within ten days of a Ministerial decision to launch it, provided that the necessary legislative measures could be introduced in advance of the completion of the build-up and passed through Parliament without delay. 
Implications 
16. We believe that, before adopting this completely new approach, Ministers should be aware of the following implications, all of which are likely to arise to a greater or lesser extent as indicated in the following paragraphs or in the Annexes:(a) the disruption of the life of Northern Ireland for which the security forces will be held responsible; 
(b) the loss of life and damage to property virtually certain to be inflicted by the security forces upon persons not themselves guilty of violence or terrorism; 
(c) the operation will in our opinion harden the polarisation of the two main factions and the alienation, certainly of the Roman Catholic community and probably of the Protestants as well, from the British connexion; 
(d) a need to resort again to internment, possibly on a large scale and certainly with a sectarian imbalance that would be represented as evidence of anti-Catholic bias; 
(e) 
a substantial requirement for legislation, which would need to be passed rapidly but which would contain elements unlikely to command bi-partisan support or to be accepted by Parliament without extensive discussion; 
(f) a need to seek legislation to indemnify Crown servants in respect of actions whose scope it will be impossible to define;",Positive,1,"a need to resort again to internment, possibly on a large scale and certainly with a sectarian imbalance that would be represented as evidence of anti-Catholic bias;",19.40372085571289
