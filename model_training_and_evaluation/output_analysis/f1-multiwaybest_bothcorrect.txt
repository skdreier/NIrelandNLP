J_Legal_Procedure	An advisory committee under Regulation 12 of the Special Powers 
Act has been set up under the chairmanship of His Honour Judge Brown to review the cases of all those against whom internment orders are made.
J_Terrorism	Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and violence.

J_Emergency-Policy	I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs"
J_Misc	In each case very careful 
consideration was given to the question whether an internment order was necessary.
J_Development-Unity	The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community.
J_Terrorism	But the terrorist 
campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness.
J_Emergency-Policy	l’irm action on security io not a subutitutc for constructive change nor is it a sitch of policy: It is 3i..:hly\htjZ .:’2(cded toallo; the dera’IatCic kroccos to 
prevail over the rule of force. For force stands in the gray of all progress and thc men of force, whatever their 
protestations, are- the enemies of us all.
J_Emergency-Policy	HQNI ARE SEEKING THIS APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, AND IN VIEW OF THE OBVIOUS POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AN EXTENSION, I AM WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE FOREWARNING YOU OF THIS.
J_Legal_Procedure	Pending the report of the commission and of 
the subsequent legislation on it, the Government therefore proposes at an early date to introduce interim legislation under the Special Powers Act to set up a special tribunal to deal with persons accused of terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will preserve the essentials of natural justice, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland.

J_Terrorism	This tribunal will be asked to 
consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either to order release or to impose a definite period of detention.

J_Misc	Play down the prospect of further internment. (In this connection I 
have told Sir Harold Black that, while we are not asking the Government of Northern Ireland to stop pulling people in, they should keep very quiet about the existence of a further list with as many as 200 names on it. 
Typically, 
he did not even know that the list existed!).

J_Emergency-Policy	Begin by trying to get agreement that no democratic government can 
afford to give way to violence and that, if violence escalates to a certain pitch, there may be no alternative to some kind of internment policy.

J_Emergency-Policy	The least unprofitable outcome of this part of the discussion would be 
an undertaking by Mr. Faulkner - ? which might be publicly quoted that internment will he Definitely brought to an end as soon as political stability is restored (unless criminal charges can be preferred in the normal way).
J_Terrorism	No-one is now detained except under these 
procedures and those detained have been found by an independent commissioner with legal training and experience to have been involved in terrorism and to be someone from whom the public need to be protected.
J_Terrorism	12. The Secretary of State received on 6 December the report of the Diplock Commission, which has been considering changes in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland in order to deal more effectively with terrorists.
J_Terrorism	10. The House of Commons approved the Detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order by 179 to 32 votes. Most Labour members, including Shadow Ministers abstained.
J_Legal_Procedure	A legal judgement made some little time ago has called this into question and the Attorney General considered that there was/ no legal limit on the time which a man could be held under Regulation 11 before he was charged, released or detained.
J_Political-Strategic	The Army and the RUC are to produce a draft which can be looked at from both the legal and political angles.
J_Utilitarian-Deterrence	The Northern Ireland Government has made a provisional classification of all the internees into three categories. Those in the category of least danger - which contains roughly 25 percent (or 150) of the present internees - are mostly those who actually throw the bombs and fire the rifles. They are all IRA men; and their release carries the risk that they would go straight back to their previous activities, with an incentive to assassinate those in the security forces whom they now think they know to have been responsible for their original detention.
J_Terrorism	It has to be remembered that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast, 
to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged.
J_Terrorism	It has to be remembered that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast, in mopping up known IRA members, has not so far been matched in other parts of the Province. In Belfast the build-up of intelligence, as a result of internment, has enabled this process to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged.
J_Emergency-Policy	We quite apreciate that the political impact 
would be greater if it could be announced that, along with accelerating the release of those already interned, there would be no further internment orders: but there are important security reasons for not doing this.
J_Legal_Procedure	In addition the Civil 
Authorities S ooia jPowers Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 (referred to as the Spoo l Powers Act or SPA) oonfers further power of arreSt 011 soldlor when on duty.

J_Terrorism	Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have much methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences.

J_Law-and-order	I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing that to public order and safety.

J_Emergency-Policy	I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as minister of Home Affairs.
J_Law-and-order	This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the polic in respect of each such person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order.
J_Terrorism	But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness.
J_Political-Strategic	and the marches due in Derry on 12 August and in Belfast at the end of the month will not take place.
J_Development-Unity	will serve to re-establish a situation in which we can get back to the task of making progress with building more harmonious inter-community relations in Northern Ireland.
J_Intl-Domestic_Precedent	A little time ago, I was in touch with Mr. Lynch 
to try to discover whether he was contemplating the possibility of internment south of the border, if we were forced to. it north of the border. Clearly that would have added to its effectiveness; but out discussions shoved that there was no possibility of parallel action south of the border.
J_Denial	We have sought to ensure that the measures taken do not discriminate as between the different sections of the community, except as the facts of the situation make inevitable. 
Protestants as well as Catholic and I.R.A., 
extremists will be liable to internment;

J_Emergency-Policy	TO RESTRICT ARRESTS FOR DETENTION TO LEADING IRA MEMBERS ONLY MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES ALREADY DOMINATE THE TWO IRA FACTIONS BUT SUCH A DECISION WOULD INHIBIT SECURITY FORCE ACTION IN AREAS WHERE THE IRA IS STILL OPERATING EFFECTIVELY.

J_Misc	EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO 9 AUG 71 MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT POLICE QUESTIONING WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF DETENTION OF INTERNMENT IS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AS AN INTELLIGENCE WEAPON IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THOSE ARRESTED HAVE BEEN WELL BRIEFED ON THEIR RIGHTS.
J_Utilitarian-Deterrence	THE PRIME TARGETS FOR RETALIATORY ACTION BY INTERNEES AFTER RELEASE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY THE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH OF THE PUC: THESE ARE FOR THE MOST PART KNOWN TO THOSE INTERNES WHOM THEY HAVE ARRESTED OR INTERROGATED.

J_Misc	THE EFFECT OF THESE TWO FACTORS COULD WELL BE TO INCREASE IRA RESISTANCE TO INTERROGATION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO WEAKEN THE DETERMINATION OF MEMBERS OF THE BRANCH TO PURSUE INTERROGATION TO SUCCESS.

J_Emergency-Policy	N VIEW OF SPECULATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MODIFYING THE INTERNMENT PROCESS AS PART OF A POLITICAL REQUIREMENT, THERE IS A NEED TO SET OUT THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF A RELEASE OF INTERNEES, OTHER THAN THROUGH THE EXISTING MACHINERY.

J_Law-and-order	against extremists of both communities to restore law and order, to put an end to intersectarian violence, and to administer a shock in the hope of forcing both factions to realise the necessity of an agreed political solution.

J_Law-and-order	THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY ARRESTING AND DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMITTING OR ABETTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AND OTHER BREACHES OF THE PEACE DESIGNED TO LEAD TO A BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER iN NORTHERN IRELAND.
J_Political-Strategic	HE WILL AT THE SAME TIME ANNOUNCE THAT ALL MARCHES AND PARADES ARE BANNED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

J_Political-Strategic	THERE WILL BE A SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ALL OUTSTANDING APPLICATIONS TO START RIFLE CLUBS ARE BEING REFUSED, AND THAT NO NEW APPLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED,
J_Misc	WHEN FAULKNER CAME TO LONDON LAST WEEK, HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOW THE RIGHT AID INDEED INEVITABLE COURSE.
J_Terrorism	IF THE MEASURES WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN LEAD, AS WE HOPE THEY WILL, TO A REDUCTION IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER FURTHER RELEASES: BUT THIS MUST OF COURSE DEPEND ON A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION.

J_Legal_Procedure	HE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IS ESTABLISHING IMEDIATELY A PROCEDURE TO REVIEW EACH CASE PERSONALLY.
J_Emergency-Policy	AFTER RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED, WE WILL RELEASE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THOSE INTERNEES WHOSE FREEDOM IS NOT NOW CONSIDERED TO INVOLVE ANY UNREASONABLE RISK TO SECURITY.
J_Law-and-order	WE HAVE ALSO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE TO BRING INTERMENT TO AN END, WHEN RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND A NORMAL SITUATION OF ORDER HAVE BEEN RESTORED THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE.
J_Terrorism	AS LONG AS ACTIVE TERRORISM PERSISTS AND BOMBING AND SHOOTING CONTINUE, WE MUST RETAIN THE POWER TO ARREST AND INTERN THOSE WHO THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED.
J_Legal_Procedure	It might be possible to bring all persons interned under the present procedure before the special court for discharge or committal to preventive detention.
J_Misc	But preventive detention is quite far removed from the present concept of internment.
J_Legal_Procedure	Naturally anyone who could be brought before a criminal court would be and it could be provided that acquittal in a criminal court was no bar to proceedings for preventive detention.

J_Development-Unity	POLITICAL PROGRESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND iS BOUND TO 
IMPEDED SO LONG AS VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION CONTINUE: AND THE PURPOSE OF. INTERNMENT, AND OF THE ARMY’S MEASURES WHICH ARE DIRECTED IMPARTIALLY AT VIOLENCE FROM WHATEVER QUARTER, IS TO RESTORE TO NORTHERN IRELAND THE NECESSARY DEGREE OF STABILITY FOR FURTHER POLITICAL ADVANCE.
J_Emergency-Policy	We are at one in condemning any form of 
violence as an instrument of political pressure; and it is our common purpose to seek to bring violence and internment and all other emergency measures to an end without delay.
J_Law-and-order	During the last two days we have discussed the 
situation in Northern Ireland in all its aspects. We have done so fully recognising that each of us remains committed to his publicly stated position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland; and we have been concerned to see whether, without prejudice to those positions, we can find some agreed means of enabling all the people of Northern Ireland to live in the conditions of peace and stability which any democracy should ensure to its citizens without regard to their religious or political conviction.
J_Terrorism	What he had in mind was that if it were possible to put two or three bad men inside as a result of investigations into their being suspected of murder or other terrorist crime he might at the same time make orders on another two or three Protestant extremists on the basis of information about their activities not necessarily related to specific criminal incidents.
J_Law-and-order	It is Her Majesty’s Government’s clear intention to bring 
internment to an end, when respect for the law and a normal situation of order have been restored throughout the Province.
J_Terrorism	The more quickly terrorist activity by the IRA subsides, the more rapid will be the pace of release; but any increase in IRA activity will delay the process.

J_Emergency-Policy	It is Her Majesty’s Government’s intention to release as soon as 
possible those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt as to the danger to security that their release would pose. Their release will be conditional on an undertaking not to take part in or encourage violence or illegal action.

J_Emergency-Policy	As soon as responsibility has been transferred an immediate review 
will be put in hand by this Government of all internment orders with a view to revoking as many of them as possible consistent with public safety.

J_Terrorism	The answer was that there were reports of varying reliability that up to 25 (of 380 or so who had been released by them) had returned to more or less active membership of the IRA - 
which did not 
necessarily mean that they had themselves become active terrorists again. This is obviously a very much smaller proportion than the one-quarter alleged by the Daily Express.
J_Denial	While believing that the Pope’s attitude hitherto 
hardly suggests he will give a forthright lead, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary agrees with the Prime Minister that it would be helpful to send a further message explaining the present position on "internment" (as the Pope persists in calling it), and expressing the hope that the Pope will be able to make a public and welcoming reference to the White Paper.
J_Legal_Procedure	We have also to decide whether, given the Attorney General’s judgment that some 30 pending prosecutions will have to be abandoned, the persons concerned should be re-arrested under the Special Powers Act (paragraph 4). Several of those whose arrests on 9th August, 1971, were judged invalid on purely technical grounds were immediately re-arrested under a valid formula.
J_Terrorism	On the other hand, what will be the reaction of "Loyalists" to the release of detainees on what will be said to be mere legal technicalities, comparable to those on which known terrorists have repeatedly been discharged in the Republic?
J_Misc	Future policy on internees will depend on the developing situation.
J_Terrorism	as dangerous terrorists, as we regard officers in the Provisional IRA.

J_Denial	The procedures contain all possible safeguards against injustice.
J_Legal_Procedure	A committee should be set up by the Lord Chancellors Office in London for urgent consideration of the rules of evidence relating to the procedure to be adopted in the Court.

J_Legal_Procedure	An understanding should be given that no proceedings should arise out 
of evidence given by witnesses at the trial and defendants shall have a right to a Preliminary Inquiry.

J_Legal_Procedure	The Northern Ireland Government were advised that we presume that the 
statue of internees and internal regulations will be dealt with under the Special Powers Acts, particularly Regulations 12 and 13.
