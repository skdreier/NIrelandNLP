Negative	While the revolt against the 
Government’s reform policies gathered momentum, fanned by an enormous volume of Press and TV coverage, and as Major Chichester-Clark prepared to face an important meeting of his local constituency association at South Derry, the Home Secretary issued a statement on 10th August.

by the Northern Ireland Government from the reform programme would endanger the present constitutional arrangements for the administration of the Province, a scarcely veiled threat of direct rule from Westminster.
Negative	3. Although in a press conference Major Chichester-Clark was careful to say 
that direct rule was not a course he would welcome, the Westminster statement does seem to have been of some help to the Stormont Government in getting Unionists to face up to the political realities, and in a confused situation a motion of no confidence put forward at the Prime Minister’s constituency meeting was not carried.
Negative	Next day, 11th August, the Northern Ireland Cabinet met.
Negative	All 
members of the Government, including junior Ministers and absentees on holiday, were consulted and were associated with a statement committing the whole Administration to firm support for Major Chichester-Clark and to implementation of its reform policies in accordance with the continuing mandate of the Unionist Parliamentary Party and of Parliament.
Negative	ANNEX A TO DOIC/200/INT DATED 17 AUG 70 
Political and General 1. 
The fortnight has been punctuated with violence and tension and there was 
intensification of the political activity, reported in the last assessment, which developed in the Unionist Party following the Northern Ireland Government’s ban on marches and the outbreak of Catholic rioting both in Belfast and, later, in Londonderry.
Negative	As pointed out in the JIC (A) Special 
Assessment of 11th August, this effectively repudiated Mr Craig’s claim to the leadership of the Party and the suggestion that he had the backing of three members of the Cabinet.
Negative	5. 
The opposition at Stormont are removing themselves even further from 
the area of negotiation.
Negative	It could create a serious situation and may express itself in demonstrations on the streets.
Negative	50 years of perpetual opposition, with the prospects of this continuing indefinitely, 
Behind all this are the two under-lying problems of Northern Ireland.
Negative	And the fact remains that, if Mr.Faulkner were to go, there is no alternative to direct rule in sight.
Negative	It is a crucial political need to bring them back into Parliament, but they must now be very near the point of no return.
Negative	7. 
First, our ordinary democratic processes do not work there.
Negative	by Mr.Lynch, will make a strong appeal to the minority.
Negative	Mr.Lynch,by throwing the weight of his government against the continued existence of Stormont, has stiffened the attitude of the Unionist leaders.
Negative	The problem 6. 
This has been written about endlessly.
Negative	The line they are now taking, and which Mr.Lynch is supporting, is that they want Stormont dismantled.
Negative	Even the inclusion of opposition members in the Government in some form of coalition, which goes far beyond anything that Mr.Faulkner could agree to, might not now satisfy them.
Negative	In Northern Ireland, however, these arrangements invariably produce a majority for the same party, and the opposition has no prospect of ever enjoying power.
Negative	The opposition for their part have taken up such an extreme line that they are going to find it difficult to return to Stormont on anything like Mr.Faulkner’s terms without losing credibility, and are posing requirements which it is impossible for Mr.Faulkner to meet.
Negative	Mr.Faulkner has made what he regards as a number of heroic proposals, but feels that he cannot carry his party any further, particularly if by so doing it looks as though he would be making concessions to Mr.Lynch and the irresponsible reactions of the opposition.
Negative	The Secretary of State said that he would consider further the arguments that had been put forward.
Negative	The SDLP should not 
underestimate the strength of the views opposing them and the Secretary of State.
Negative	By means of careful timing he had succeeded In removing the barricades with the fewest possible casualties.
Negative	They must also remember that as a member of the Cabinet he was not an entirely free agent.
Negative	The timing of further action was critical.
Negative	The Unionists on the other hand had achieved Operation Motorman, the plebiscite, the exclusion of the Republic from the Conference and the continued activities of the UDA.
Negative	political careers but also their lives.
Negative	The meeting further adjourned at 11 00 pm.
Negative	There was certainly no case whatever for continuing to intern a single member of the Official IRA.
Negative	It was agreed that any press announcement would be confined to a statement that the meeting had taken place and would be resumed the following day.

LOYALIST COUNCIL AT 12 NOON ON WEDNESDAY 14 MARCH IN STORMONT CASTLE Present:

Mr Henderson Mr Green Mr Crowe 
The Secretary of State said that the United Loyalist Council (ULC) had asked to see him again, and in accordance with his previous undertaking he had agreed to see them before the publication of the White Paper.
Negative	Mr Herron said that by their acts the Army were alienating the Loyalist community and encouraging the establishment of a Protestant counterpart to the IRA. 
There might in the past have been Ulster Defence Association (UDA) clubs selling
Negative	There was a number of points which he wished to put to the ULC.
Negative	But he was concerned about the treatment of Loyalists.
Negative	Mr Henderson said that the ULC were mostly not politicians, they were simply patriots interested in the future of their country.
Negative	There was therefore no justification for any fear of a "sell out" and certainly no justification for any form of violence.
Negative	I TRIED TO 
PERSUADE THEM THAT IT WOULD NOT, AND SAID THAT THOUGHT THE SECRTARY OF STATE HAD AUTHORISED ME TO SAY THAT HE WANTED TO HELP THEM IN THEIR DIFFICULT POSITION, HE COULD NOT GIVE THEM GUARANTEES.

Negative	3. THE SDLP THEN ASKED FOR A FURTHER MEETING WITH ME ( ON MONDAY 7 AUGUST). 
THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MEETING.

MERITS OF THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT, THEY WOULD BE DESTROYED AS A POLITICAL PARTY IF THEY LEFT TALKS WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT IT.
Negative	2. AT THE LONDUNDERRY TALKS WITH ME ON 3 AUGUST (MY 
TEL 025 TO NIO), A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED, BUT THE MAIN TOPIC WAS TALKS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
Negative	THE SDLP SAID THAT THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO 
MEET HIM, THEY WOULD NOT DO SO UNLESS THEY FIRST HAD A FIRM GUARANTEE THAT INTERNMENT WOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MEETING.
Negative	4. THE SDLP HAD MEETINGS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON 7 AND 8 AUGUST.
Negative	I LATER TELEPHONED HIM TO CONFIRM THIS.
Negative	I SAID I WAS SURE HE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SUCH GUARANTEE.
Negative	I AGAIN AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD SEIZE THE POLITICAL OPENINGS PROVIDED BY OPERATION MOTORMAN AND THAT AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, THEY SHOULD TALK DIRECT WITH MR WHITELAW INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO USE HIS OFFICIALS SUCH AS MYSELF AS INTERMEDIARIES.
Negative	MR. LYNCH IS VERY NERVOUS OF ANY SUGGESTION OF PRIOR CONSULTATION OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE.

Seventy persons acting as Representatives or Observers for thirty-five Organisations responded to an invitation to an Ad Hoc Conference held on Sunday at the Student’s Union in Queens University.
Negative	The Organisations bridged the Social, Political and Religious divide.
Negative	They were as follows:-
Negative	It was also recommended that the Committee should concern itself with a circulation of publications and information directed at public opinion in the U.K., Europe and throughout the world.
Negative	4. The Conference decided that if imprisonment without trial is still operative on February 9th (the sixth month anniversary of its introduction) that their campaign and activities should commence on that date.
Negative	Presumably it is possible to arrange that such men are not charged.
Negative	The second category is more difficult; First, 
those against whom there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge, but against whom no warrant has yet been issued.
Negative	This problem 
has, of course, a wider application than the particular FCO interest, but it was nonetheless a point that was put to me in Dublin recently, and I suspect the Irish Government is every bit as anxious as we are to maintain Mr Whitelaw’s good name for straight dealing in any immediate post-truce period.

it might be desirable for a public announcement to be made that warrants have been issued and will still be executed against

Negative	Under such circumstances there would be no excuse for a violent reaction to the White Paper from any quarter.
Negative	The Secretary of State said that a basis had first to be established from which both sides could say how power-sharing should be achieved.
Negative	(8) It was desirable to engender a climate of goodwill at the time of the publication of the White Paper and for this reason they had established a dialogue with loyalists in an attempt to find common ground.
Negative	(11) They asked whether they could receive advance copies of the White Paper.
Negative	They felt that there might be a spate of bombings by the Provisionals before the White Paper, although they thought there might be a cease-fire after its publication.
Negative	The Secretary of State said he would consider this request.
Negative	(5) They wished to co-operate with the White Paper but it was essential that they could identify with any new institutions..
Negative	He urged the SDLP to look for features with which they could agree in the White Paper and be prepared to discuss other issues. 
N C ABB OTT 16 March 1973
Negative	The Secretary of State explained that he too was mindful of the possibility of an escalation of violence at the time of the White Paper and had planned accordingly.
Negative	National Boards, for example the Pig Marketing Board, had always been run by the Unionist Party.
Negative	(7) In any forthcoming elections in which PR should be used, consideration should be given to using the List system as opposed to the Single Transferable Vote system.
Negative	In conclusion the Secretary of State made it clear that there would be an opportunity for all groups to make their views known after the White Paper and before the Constitutional Bill.
Negative	The Secretary of State said that he would bear this point in mind.
Negative	(10) Where possible there should be local fiscal autonomy allied to public ownership.
Negative	The Secretary of State said he would consider this proposal.
Negative	(9) They were mindful of the possibility of violence from both sides when the White Paper was published.
Negative	There would be advantage at the present time in a conciliatory gesture by, for example, releasing some men from Long Kesh.
Negative	Power-sharing must be seen to be operative at all levels.
Negative	(6) No group, including Republican Clubs and Sinn Fien, should be debarred from taking part in forthcoming elections.
Negative	In the past they had not been able to identify with, for example, the police and the courts.

3. Although, following recent military operations, the SDLP had made statements indicating that they were reconsidering their decision to have talks with Mr Whitelaw, they met him on Monday evening, and the talks continued on Tuesday.
Negative	Four Provisionals were arrested by the RUC in Londonderry on 1 September in the act of robbing a Savings Bank.
Negative	These arrests have led to the UDA accusing the Security Forces of harassment.

Force patrols were increased and only one UDA road block was reported.

Negative	A patrol of 1 PARA arrested a man armed with a pistol who was later identified as 
(self styled 
Lt Col in the UDA). This arrest was followed by attempts by ANDERSON of the UDA to negotiate his immediate release.
Negative	Over 20 Provisional Officers have now been charged since the beginning of Operation MOTORMAN and 9 have been detained.
Negative	Following the discovery of a hand grenade in a car in Lisburn three Protestans were arrested, one of whom has been charged and remanded in custody.

Introduction 1.

Negative	Work has started on a new camp to replace the accommodation currently provided by St Genevieves School,and should be available by mid October.
Negative	The shooting incidents continue to increase with sniping 
at patrols and sentries.

completed.
Negative	A Commonwealth Judge might be included: it might even be necessary for panels to be formed.
Negative	The Home Secretary asked whether the statement would give such detail as the type of illegal organisation - Brady or Goulding - to which it was alleged that the individual belonged.
Negative	Mr. Faulkner said that he supported the Chief Constable’s proposal that mobile patrols should have machine-gun support if necessary.
Negative	Mr. Faulkner said that Judge Brown’s Committee might consider cases in two stages, with lawyers admitted to one but not to the other.
Negative	The Ministry of Defence has now made arrangements so that this practice would be encouraged, though it would be wrong to suggest that all cases would be covered.
Negative	The Home Secretary referred to arrangements which had been made at local initiative whereby a soldier with an automatic weapon sometimes accompanied an R.U.C.

provided with automatic weapons to guard police stations where the army were unable to provide protection.

Negative	Mr. Faulkner said that the G.O.C.
Negative	The Home Secretary said that he had agreed that the R.U.C.
Negative	Mr. Faulkner said that he was disinclined to go into such detail.
Negative	He was not disposed to agree to the use of automatic weapons by police officers on the streets.
Negative	However, not only were the experiments again of necessity different from the real thing, but in these cases the volunteers neither enjoyed a break during which medical examination and later interrogation took place, nor were they members of an organisation bound together by bonds of loyalty which would help them to hold out.
Negative	In these cases many of the volunteers were found unable to withstand such sensory deprivation for more than a comparatively short period.

Negative	This was a reserved matter and fell to the United Kingdom authorities.
Positive	Orders had been made only in respect of people actively engaged in terrorism, and he had in fact refused to make orders in a few cases.
Positive	Internment should properly be regarded not so much as an alternative to trial as an alternative to being shot in an act of terrorism.
Positive	The test for an internee’s fitness for release was not so much his innocence of any association with terrorist organisations, but whether he could be set at large without danger to the community.
Negative	Long Kesh at present provided accommodation for 380 internees and would have to be extended to accommodate 640 by the end of January.

Negative	In the other cases (though not, as mentioned, in that of Mr cClean) we were told that the atmosphere of rigid discipline was largely effective in its purpose, and, therefore, to enforce the posture any substantial degree of physical force was unnecessary and was not used.
Negative	In the circumstances there had to be bodily contact between guards and detainees, but the guards had been specially trained to handle detainees by methods which avoided violence or physical damage.

Negative	No single measure can overcome the bitterness of the past few years - the bitterness indeed of far too much of Northern Ireland’s history.
Negative	As a Government we have been doing everything in our power to bring that violence and that suffering to an end.
Negative	But we believe that nothing less than the proposals I have described would enable us to break out of the deadlock of the last few months.
Negative	All the security forces will continue to have our full backing and support.
Negative	EDWARD I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: and in particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion.
Negative	We admire the steadiness and courage with which you have done this.
Negative	The Army will stay in Northern Ireland as long as any faction seeks to terrorise or intimidate ordinary people.
Positive	Second, that there should be a gradual reduction in internment beginning 
with those internees who could be released without unacceptable risks.
Negative	We 
had hoped that he and his colleagues might see their way to accepting them.
Negative	Third, that the people of Northern Ireland should be given a chance as soon 
as it is practicable, and again at intervals later, to decide for themselves in a plebiscite whether or not they want to remain in the United Kingdom.
Negative	I want, before I end, to say a special word to those of you who are our fellow citizens living in Northern Ireland.
Negative	And so we have worked out a set of proposals to provide this fresh start 
out of the vicious circle of violence and yet more violence.
Negative	These were the proposals which I put to Mr. Faulkner on Wednesday.
Negative	The Government have concluded after long and anxious thought that we must make possible a completely fresh start.
Negative	You are the ones who have had to endure the years of violence and fear.
Negative	Because the United Kingdom Parliament and Government have the same duty towards the people of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country property, and to give them - 
all of them - a fair say in the decisions that 
shape their future.

It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought 
of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers Act.
Negative	There would be great dangers, however, in trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced to reduce their campaign against civilians.

OPERATIONS There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate 
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces.
Negative	INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
Questions about the Government’s plans for dealing with the level of 
military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the news, and are difficult to handle.
Negative	In considering in due course whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving theirobjectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since Operation Motorman and what has happened to them.

Negative	The UDA has continued to patrol in Belfast, particularly in the areas to the South of Andersonstown, and there has been some hardening in their attitude towards the Security Forces, particularly in their refusal to discard cudgels and masks.

Negative	In Londonderry, patrols report a reasonable reception from the locals although some children and the Derry Young Hooligans present an increasing nuisance factor.
Negative	On 24 September an antiinternment rally in Andersonstown attracted 2,000 protestors, a high attendance for this type of event in recent months.
Negative	On the same day, a group of IRA thugs from the Republic attacked three UDR families close to the Fermanagh border, brutally murdering a private and his wife, and rapidly re-crossed the border cheering and blowing their motor horns.
Negative	However, following the arrest by Security Forces of Eddie Campbell (a Provisional Battalion Commander) on 20 September 1972, disturbances in the Ardoyne resulted in a gunman being shot dead and a second wounded.
Negative	Besides sporadic shooting incidents the nearby Customs Post was blown up on 23 September 1972 and hooligans have roamed the streets of the town.

Negative	Shooting incidents remain at a low level and, although casualties are fewer than last week, one soldier has died from gunshot wounds.
Negative	There has been little Protestant activity in the Waterside though two masked UDA patrols dispersed and removed their masks when told to do so by the Security Forces.

Negative	He complained that only Catholics had been interned and argued that Protestant snipers who had killed in the past couple of nights had not been dealt with.
Positive	The Home Secretary 
replied that all those arrested under the internment operation were people who the security forces believed to be active in terrorism.
Negative	He said that the raid on 
the Falls Road, which had been peaceful for a year after the army had moved in, was a critical mistake.

Negative	There are reported to be 102 leally registered clubs, and unless membership is frozen, new applicants
