J_Misc	If in fact the 
category C. internees are all about equal from the point of view of danger to the public safety, then the moment some of them are released the continued detention of the others in category C. is called into question. 
This 
seems to mean that the matter will have to be dealt with on a strictly individual basis, and it also means that only general conditions can be applied to the continued rundown of internment.

J_Terrorism	Meantime, the Government reaffirms its determination to 
improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot easily be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law.

J_Law-and-order	But the Government 
wishes to make clear at once that these measures will not in any way be directed against the holding of opinions, but only against the use of violence and terror to force those opinions on law
J_Denial	Back this up with an undertaking that the appeals procedure (due to 
begin on Saturday) will be conducted as rapidly as possible and will embrace all internees, whether they appeal or not.

J_Terrorism	Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry then out.

J_Denial	Any such person will then have the right
J_Emergency-Policy	IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT, IN SPITE OF CAREFUL EXAMINATION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN PRESENT CONDITIONS (EG INTIMIDATION) TO BRING PRESENT INTERNEES TO TRIAL.
J_Terrorism	THE LATEST SERIES OF ACTS OF TERRORISM
J_Emergency-Policy	I AM SENDING YOU THIS MESSAGE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL VERY SHORTLY BE ANNOUNCING THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF THE LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS,, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT.
J_Terrorism	The aim should be to try to arrest those extremists whom moderate opinion would like to see removed because they stood in the way of conciliation.
J_Legal_Procedure	The Chief Constable suggested that if it happened that Protestant extremists suspected of murder or other terrorist crime had to be let go after interrogation by the CID they should be re-arrested under Regulation 11 and interrogated by the Special Branch.

J_Legal_Procedure	THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that it was agreed that, at least from the point of view of opinion in Great Britain, the success of all the measures in contemplation depended very largely on its being manifest that the machinery of the Advisory Committee was working speedily and justly.
J_Emergency-Policy	If the measures which Her Majestyâ€™s Government have taken lead, 
as is hopedthey will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly established improvement in the security situation.
J_Emergency-Policy	Other terrorists (as specified from time to time by the Secretary of State) who are known, on the strength of reliable intelligence to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order."
