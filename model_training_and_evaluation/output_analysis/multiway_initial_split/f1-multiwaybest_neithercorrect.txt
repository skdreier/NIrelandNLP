J_Denial	Pending the report of the commission and of 
the subsequent legislation on it, the Government therefore proposes at an early date to introduce interim legislation under the Special Powers Act to set up a special tribunal to deal with persons accused of terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will preserve the essentials of natural justice, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland.

J_Legal_Procedure	This tribunal will be asked to 
consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either to order release or to impose a definite period of detention.
J_Denial	Play down the prospect of further internment. (In this connection I 
have told Sir Harold Black that, while we are not asking the Government of Northern Ireland to stop pulling people in, they should keep very quiet about the existence of a further list with as many as 200 names on it. 
Typically, 
he did not even know that the list existed!).
J_Misc	The least unprofitable outcome of this part of the discussion would be 
an undertaking by Mr. Faulkner - ? which might be publicly quoted that internment will he Definitely brought to an end as soon as political stability is restored (unless criminal charges can be preferred in the normal way).
J_Misc	Begin by trying to get agreement that no democratic government can 
afford to give way to violence and that, if violence escalates to a certain pitch, there may be no alternative to some kind of internment policy.

J_Misc	Then, try to get Mr. Faulkner to justify the way in which internment 
has been carried out and the treatment which has been given to the internees. (Some reference to the conditions at Long Kesh; the Red Cross inspection; the derogation under the European Convention on Human Rights, etc

J_Legal_Procedure	No-one is now detained except under these

J_Misc	The Government would greatly prefer it if the ordinary criminal procedures were effective in bringing these people to justice, but the findings of the Diplock Commission were that they are not and cannot be so effective under present conditions in Northern Ireland.
J_Legal_Procedure	12. The Secretary of State received on 6 December the report of the Diplock Commission, which has been considering changes in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland in order to deal more effectively with terrorists.
J_Legal_Procedure	The Government expressed regret that such an order should be necessary in any part of the United Kingdom. The Order gives effect to the Government's decision to end internment and detention by the Executive and provides for the establishment of Commissions.
J_Legal_Procedure	The Army and the RUC are to produce a draft which can be looked at from both the legal and political angles.

J_Legal_Procedure	When the Internment Orders were signed no additional 
information was conveyed to the next of kin although the internees themselves were given a copy of the Interment Order.
J_Terrorism	The morale and operational effectiveness of the IRA, and hence their level of intimidation, 
would inevitably rise the moment they knew that arrests under the Special Powers Act had stopped.

J_Misc	It has to be remembered that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast, in mopping up known IRA members, has not so far been matched in other parts of the Province. In Belfast the build-up of intelligence, as a result of internment, has enabled this process to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged.

J_Terrorism	The Northern Ireland Government has made a provisional classification of all the internees into three categories. Those in the category of least danger - which contains roughly 25 percent (or 150) of the present internees - are mostly those who actually throw the bombs and fire the rifles. They are all IRA men; and their release carries the risk that they would go straight back to their previous activities, with an incentive to assassinate those in the security forces whom they now think they know to have been responsible for their original detention.

J_Legal_Procedure	I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as minister of Home Affairs.
J_Last-resort	Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have much methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences.
J_Denial	This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the polic in respect of each such person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order.

J_Emergency-Policy	But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness.

J_Terrorism	Protestants as well as Catholic and I.R.A., 
extremists will be liable to internment;
J_Denial	we hope that these measures can be strictly temporary
J_Misc	IT SEEMS INEVITABLE, THEREFORE, THAT INTELLIGENCE PROCUREMENT WILL SUFFER.

J_Political-Strategic	IN ANY PROGRAMME OF RELEASE FOR POLITICAL REASONS THE IRA WILL CERTAINLY REGARD THE MEASURE AS PROOF OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS. IT MAY ALSO BE SO REGARDED BY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
J_Utilitarian-Deterrence	IRA RECRUITING WILL BENEFIT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RELUCTANCE TO JOIN OF THOSE WHO FEAR INTERNMENT IS OVERCOME, AND THOSE ON THE RUN WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO RETURN: THERE ARE ABOUT 140 SUCH PEOPLE OPERATING FROM SOUTH OF THE BODER.
J_Utilitarian-Deterrence	ANY ATTEMPT TO LINK A PROGRAMME OF RELEASES WITH AN UNDERTAKING NOT TO MAKE FURTHER ARRESTS WOULD BE REGARDED BY THE IRA AS A STILL GREATER SUCCESS AND THEY MUST BE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOUP THEIR LOSSES AND TO EQUIP THEMSELVES TO INTENSIFY OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE AT A DATE OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING.

J_Utilitarian-Deterrence	THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK THAT ANY INTERNEE RELEASED AS A POLITICAL GESTURE WILL RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND, REPAIRING THE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE WHICH HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON BOTH FACTIONS OF THE IRA SINCE 9 AUG 71.

J_Misc	THE PRIME TARGETS FOR RETALIATORY ACTION BY INTERNEES AFTER RELEASE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY THE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH OF THE PUC: THESE ARE FOR THE MOST PART KNOWN TO THOSE INTERNES WHOM THEY HAVE ARRESTED OR INTERROGATED.

impartial action, aimed at the removal of arms and explosives by means of a massive reinforcement of troops, and accompanied by searches, interrogation, and probably internment.

J_Terrorism	THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY ARRESTING AND DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMITTING OR ABETTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AND OTHER BREACHES OF THE PEACE DESIGNED TO LEAD TO A BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER iN NORTHERN IRELAND.

J_Misc	I AM SENDING YOU THIS MESSAGE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL VERY SHORTLY BE ANNOUNCING THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF THE LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS,, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT.

J_Utilitarian-Deterrence	IF THE MEASURES WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN LEAD, AS WE HOPE THEY WILL, TO A REDUCTION IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER FURTHER RELEASES: BUT THIS MUST OF COURSE DEPEND ON A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION.

J_Misc	In discussion the point was made that the arrest of even 
minor IRA members helped to build up the intelligence picture and to contribute to the attrition of the IRA; it could also lead to more important arrests.
J_Misc	Mr. Whitelaw said that the security authorities in 
Northern Ireland, and in particular the Special Branch, were concerned about the effects of the new low profile security posture, and about the diminution of intelligence which was resulting from the reduction in the number of arrests.

J_Denial	During the last two days we have discussed the 
situation in Northern Ireland in all its aspects. We have done so fully recognising that each of us remains committed to his publicly stated position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland; and we have been concerned to see whether, without prejudice to those positions, we can find some agreed means of enabling all the people of Northern Ireland to live in the conditions of peace and stability which any democracy should ensure to its citizens without regard to their religious or political conviction.
J_Misc	We are at one in condemning any form of 
violence as an instrument of political pressure; and it is our common purpose to seek to bring violence and internment and all other emergency measures to an end without delay.

J_Legal_Procedure	and as not in itself constituting any formal change of arrest policy, since any interim custody orders would be incidental to action taken 
The Secretary of State evidently regarded this decision as a first step against 
suspected murderers and terrorists.
J_Emergency-Policy	What he had in mind was that if it were possible to put two or three bad men inside as a result of investigations into their being suspected of murder or other terrorist crime he might at the same time make orders on another two or three Protestant extremists on the basis of information about their activities not necessarily related to specific criminal incidents.
J_Misc	The point had been made in discussion that, when factors came to the knowledge of the Northern Ireland Government that pointed to the need for continued detention of a person whose release was recommended by the Advisory Committee, they should be put before the Committee for consideration.
J_Misc	The pace of releases will depend on the state of public security and the effect upon it of the release of particular internees whose cases are under review.

J_Emergency-Policy	The Government have taken this decision after consultation with their military advisers.

J_Misc	The more quickly terrorist activity by the IRA subsides, the more rapid will be the pace of release; but any increase in IRA activity will delay the process.
J_Emergency-Policy	ensure that instructions are issued to the RUC on the importance of distinguishing between the type of questioning appropriate to a prisoner against whom charges are likely to be brought in court and the type appropriate when the object is simply to secure intelligence. 
(The actual 
conduct of interrogation for intelligence purposes will be discussed later in the meeting.)
J_Political-Strategic	On the other hand, what will be the reaction of "Loyalists" to the release of detainees on what will be said to be mere legal technicalities, comparable to those on which known terrorists have repeatedly been discharged in the Republic?
J_Misc	ensure that instructions are issued to the RUC on the importance of distinguishing between the type of questioning appropriate to a prisoner against whom charges are likely to be brought in court and the type appropriate when the object is simply to secure intelligence.

J_Political-Strategic	Even if the law is amended effectively, there ill be strong reasons on practical as well as political grounds for not arresting everyone who commits the offence of membership of an illegal organisations; presumably members of the Official IRA will be excluded.

J_Denial	This is a far cry from internment.

J_Law-and-order	the commissioner must enquire into any case referred to him to see whether the person has been concerned in terrorism, and, if so, whether his detention is necessary for the protection of the public
J_Legal_Procedure	The procedures contain all possible safeguards against injustice.
J_Misc	Where these procedures contain departures from the normal judicial process 
the commissioners’ inquiries are in private, 
for example, and the person who is the subject of the enquiry may be excluded from parts of it) these are necessary because, as the Commission reported, witnesses will not give evidence in the ordinary courts.
