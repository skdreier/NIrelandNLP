Negative	This extreme

Negative	Our electoral arrangements are based on the doctrine "winner takes all". This is all right if each side wins from time to time.

Negative	In Mr Johnston’s view it was still essential to gain intelligence 
- the initiative might fail, or it might take a 
long time to succeed: in any event it would be wrong of the security forces not to keep themselves well informed of the threat of subversion.
Negative	The reasons for this calm are 
complex, and one can only guess at the relative importance of the various factors.
Negative	The background is, of course, a great improvement in the law and order The great majority of these

Negative	No doubt you will hear that call anyway with increasing stridency in coming months; 
what I am now concerned with, 
however, is that we should not incur charges of bad faith, with all the attendant political problems, if we continue to arrest certain offenders even after the truce.
Negative	3. But there are two further categories of IRA men.
Negative	there 
must be many IRA men,often now taking refuge in the Republic, against whom warrants have been issued.
Negative	We did have a responsible 
approach by the government authorities at that time, insofar as the IRA was concerned, but unfortunately on this occasion, Mr. Lynch’s government seems to be going out of its way to facilitate the IRA on the one hand and then on the second hand to say that it condemns violence.

Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL 
1. The main political development this week has been the decision of the SDLP to talk to Mr Whitelaw.
Negative	Security Force Activity 3. 
The Security Forces have continued to make inroads on the Provisional IRA 
and a number of Provisional officers have been arrested including engineering officer of 1 Bn who is believed to be responsible for a number of sophisticated devices which have been used recently in Andersonstown.
Negative	Following the recent pronouncements by the Provisional IRA about the intensification of their campaign this is a welcome development.
Negative	These schools will continue to be a source of propaganda for the Provisionals until alternative accommodation is obtained.
Negative	This is an indication of the slightly reduced tempo of IRA operations brought about by extensive patrolling, made possible by the present force levels, which inhibits the movement of weapons, gunmen and explosives.
Negative	If these could be modified it would be easier to retain support for the principle of internment itself.
Negative	Mr. Faulkner said that he would speedily put forward a package of proposals for revamping the internment procedures for the Home Secretary to consider.
Negative	Phase 2, the completion of the accommodation would take the remainder of the six months, Phase 3 (security fencing) would take two weeks and would be undertaken after the contractors had finished, by RE labour to be provided under CRE Northern Ireland arrangements and control.
Negative	(d) It will remain the role of the Security Forces to restore and maintain law and order, but more emphasis will devolve on the latter (see para.

In only one case was it necessary to use any considerable degree of

Negative	The Government here in London is therefore obliged to take over for the time being full responsibility for the conduct of affairs in Northern Ireland.
Negative	All of us have been horrified by the violence in Northern Ireland and by 
the suffering it has caused.
Negative	I was very sorry when he told me that he and his colleagues could not continue as the Government of Northern Ireland if responsibility for law and order were transferred to Westminster.

with HMG in Westminster that a site at Long Kesh was the best choice for this purpose: and that it was desirable for an alternative use for the accommodation to be found.
Negative	4. Even if it appeared possible to find a way round these 
difficulties, it is clear that they could not be resolved speedily.
Negative	defence is a reserved subject under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and the financing by the Stormont Government of accommodation for troops would be unconstitutional: secondly,
Negative	At the same time, the Northern 
Ireland Government recognize our difficulties: they have given assurances that if internment were introduced, they would see what financial aid could be given and in any case would pay rent for the camp; they also recognize their responsibility to provide the custodians and domestic services required in the event of internment.
Negative	The "special courts" now operating in the Republic 
are in fact courts, and they proceed under the rule of law and the rules of evidence.
Negative	Some of the process of the special courts in the Republic is in camera, but counsel and solicitors for the accused remain in court and the burden of proof and the rules of evidence remain.
Positive	and therefore one is very likely to have an increasing number of incidents along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Negative	Unfortunately this will happen with the 
army, I suspect, from time to time, because unlike the previous occasion of 1956/60 when the Ulster Special Constabulary were responsible for security along the order, there were 
who used every lane 
and every road and every river, and they knew exactly when they wore in Northern Ireland and when they weren’t.

Medical officers have no part to play in the actual process of

Negative	Is the list of wanted men to be made public once internment is introuced?

Negative	Whose property is this list once Mr FAULKNER requests the deal and HMG agrees it?
